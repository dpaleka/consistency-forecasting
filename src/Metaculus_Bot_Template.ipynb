One such rumor was that the move was sparked by progress in a new AI system with potentially dangerous capabilities. Citing anonymous sources, [Reuters reported the following](https://www.reuters.com/technology/sam-altmans-ouster-openai-was-precipitated-by-letter-board-about-ai-breakthrough-2023-11-22/):\\n\\n>Ahead of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s four days in exile, several staff researchers wrote a letter to the board of directors warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\\n>\\n>. . .\\n>\\n>After being contacted by Reuters, OpenAI, which declined to comment, acknowledged in an internal message to staffers a project called Q\\\\* and a letter to the board before the weekend's events, one of the people said.

It issued its first arrest warrants in 2005, and according to the AP [has issued](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-international-criminal-court-hague-palestinians-1f683a6e2e150d91c415eb1d0a19a44d) a total of 42 arrest warrants.

CEO Elon Musk unveiled a design for the Tesla Bot, a humanoid robot. According to The Verge, Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company is working on a humanoid robot and that it will build a prototype sometime next year. The humanoid robot will leverage Tesla's experience with automated machines in its factories, as well as some of the hardware and software that powers the company's Autopilot driver assistance software. Musk, who has spoken publicly about his fears of runaway artificial intelligence, said Tesla is intended to be friendly, but that Tesla is designing the robot at a mechanical level so that you can run away from it, and most likely overpower it. It will be five feet, eight inches tall, and have a screen for a face. The robots will be designed to handle tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring, the company's website reads.

In particular, the device must be a humanoid robot, and must be able to perform some physical tasks upon being given directions to do so - a remote-controlled device manually operated by a human will not count. Note that this question will resolve as the first date on which general consumers physically possess the device, having purchased it, leased it, licensed it, or otherwise contracted with Tesla for physical custody of it, not on the date on which a deposit can be placed, a device can be ordered, pre-ordered, or otherwise contracted for.

The humanoid robot will leverage Tesla's experience with automated machines in its factories, as well as some of the hardware and software that powers the company's Autopilot driver assistance software. Musk, who has spoken publicly about his fears of runaway artificial intelligence, said Tesla is intended to be friendly, but that Tesla is designing the robot at a mechanical level so that you can run away from it, and most likely overpower it. It will be five feet, eight inches tall, and have a screen for a face. The robots will be designed to handle tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring, the company's website reads.

In particular, the device must be a humanoid robot, and must be able to perform some physical tasks upon being given directions to do so - a remote-controlled device manually operated by a human will not count. Note that this question will resolve as the first date on which general consumers physically possess the device, having purchased it, leased it, licensed it, or otherwise contracted with Tesla for physical custody of it, not on the date on which a deposit can be placed, a device can be ordered, pre-ordered, or otherwise contracted for.

While RESP-NET does not collect data on all hospitalizations caused by respiratory illnesses, it can describe hospitalizations caused by three viruses that account for a large proportion of these hospitalizations. Surveillance is conducted through a network of acute care hospitals in select counties or county equivalents in 12 states for RSV surveillance, 13 states for COVID-19 surveillance, and 14 states for influenza surveillance. The surveillance platforms for COVID-19, RSV, and influenza (known as [COVID-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covid-net/purpose-methods.html), [RSV-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/overview-methods.html), and [FluSurv-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/influenza-hospitalization-surveillance.htm), respectively) cover more than 30 million people and include an estimated 8-10% of the U.S. population.\\n\\nThe underlying source data for the RESP-NET dashboard can be found at [this link](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-Laboratory-Confirmed-RSV-COVID-19-and-Flu/kvib-3txy).\\n\\nIn its [Respiratory Disease Season Outlook](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/whats-new/2023-2024-season-outlook.html) for 2023-24, the CDC describes the 2022-23 peak as a \"tripledemic\" due to high incidence of COVID, flu, and RSV at the same time.

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\\n\\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\\n\\n>Tesla’s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla’s incorporation to Texas.\\n\\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as “crap”.\\n\\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\\n\\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\\n\\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\\n\\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\\n\\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\\n\\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has [advised](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1) shareholders *not* to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nSee related question:\\n\\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)\", 'resolution_criteria': \"The question will resolve **Yes** if Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) releases a statement explicitly advising Tesla shareholders to vote *against* Elon Musk's pay package at the 2024 Tesla shareholder meeting OR the re-election of Kimbal Musk to the Tesla board of directors.

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\\n\\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\\n\\n>Tesla’s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla’s incorporation to Texas.\\n\\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as “crap”.\\n\\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\\n\\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\\n\\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\\n\\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\\n\\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\\n\\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has [advised](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1) shareholders *not* to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\\n\\n*Will the proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) advise Tesla shareholders to vote *against* Elon Musk's $57 billion package OR the re-election of Kimbal Musk?*\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nSee related question:\\n\\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)\", 'resolution_criteria': \"The question will resolve **Yes** if Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) releases a statement explicitly advising Tesla shareholders to vote *against* Elon Musk's pay package at the 2024 Tesla shareholder meeting OR the re-election of the Kimbal Musk to the Tesla board of directors.

      "\n",
      "**Current Situation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The 2023-24 respiratory virus season is ongoing in the US, with COVID-19, influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) circulating simultaneously.\n",
      "* According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current weekly hospitalization rates for each virus are:\n",
      "\t+ COVID-19: 14.1 per 100,000 (as of February 11, 2023) [1]\n",
      "\t+ Influenza: 23.1 per 100,000 (as of February 11, 2023) [2]\n",
      "\t+ RSV: 2.4 per 100,000 (as of February 4, 2023) [3]\n",
      "* The combined peak for each virus has not yet occurred, as the rates are still increasing or plateauing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trends and Projections:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The CDC's FluView report suggests that influenza activity is expected to continue for several more weeks, with the peak potentially occurring in late February or early March [2].\n",
      "* COVID-19 hospitalization rates have been increasing slowly over the past few weeks, but the rate of growth has slowed down [1].\n",
      "* RSV hospitalization rates have been declining slightly over the past two weeks, but it's unclear if this trend will continue [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "**Resolution Based on Current Information:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Based on the current trends and projections, it's difficult to determine whether the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 in the US will occur within four weeks of the combined peak for each of COVID, influenza, and RSV.\n",
      "* The answer to this question would likely be \"Unknown\" or \"Maybe\" at this point, as the peaks for each virus have not yet occurred, and the interactions between them are complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please let me know if you'd like me to gather more information or provide further context to help with this question ### Structured Analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Overview and Context:**\n",
      "The central question is whether the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 in the US will occur within four weeks of the combined peak for each of COVID, influenza, and RSV in the 2023-24 season. This involves predicting and understanding peak timelines for three separate viruses and their confluence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Historical Data Assessments:**\n",
      "- **2022-23 Season Patterns:**\n",
      "  - RSV peaked first (week ending November 12, 2022).\n",
      "  - Influenza had its maximum rate during the week ending December 3, 2022.\n",
      "  - COVID peaked later (week ending December 31, 2022).\n",
      "  - Combined hospitalization saw a significant peak on December 3, 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Current Season Situation:**\n",
      "- **Hospitalization Rates (as of February 2023):**\n",
      "  - COVID-19: 14.1 per 100,000\n",
      "  - Influenza: 23.1 per 100,000\n",
      "  - RSV: 2.4 per 100,000\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Projected Peak Periods:**\n",
      "  - Influenza: late February to early March 2024.\n",
      "  - COVID-19: slowly increasing with a potential delayed peak.\n",
      "  - RSV: slight decline but peaks are harder to predict.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Insights from CDC RESP-NET:**\n",
      "- Technological and monitoring improvements allow more precise predictions and tracking.\n",
      "- The “tripledemic” pattern seen in 2022-23 could be a template for 2023-24.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Contributing Factors for Prediction:**\n",
      "- **Synchronicity of Peaks:**\n",
      "  - Viruses can peak at different times causing a staggered but overlapping impact.\n",
      "  - Environmental factors and emerging virus variants can impact the timing of peaks.\n",
      "- **Interaction Dynamics:**\n",
      "  - Interaction among circulating viruses can influence hospital rates: a high rate of one might affect others.\n",
      "  - Increased vaccination rates and public health measures may impact the behavior differently for each virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. For and Against Analysis:**\n",
      "- **For Prediction of Coinciding Peaks:**\n",
      "  - Past seasons show a strong overlap, increasing probability.\n",
      "  - Measures and virus behaviors tend to lead to similar outcomes.\n",
      "- **Against Prediction of Coinciding Peaks:**\n",
      "  - Variability in viral evolution, public health responses, and immunity levels.\n",
      "  - Slightly shifting peak patterns due to unique yearly factors like new variants, changing weather patterns, and public health measures (masking, social distancing).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Analysis and Calculation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining historical data trends, CDC's projections, and robust comparative analysis of contributing factors, I believe there’s a strong probability the combined peak will align within a four-week period, akin to the pattern from the previous season (2022-23).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Historical Accuracy (2022-23):** Strong overlap within a 3-week period.\n",
      "- **Current Peaks and Projected Timeline:** Each virus is at or approaching high activity levels.\n",
      "- **Interaction Effect:** Epidemiological response and interactions among viruses usually peak around common response times.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Forecast:\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking all analyzed data into account:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Probability: 75%**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rationale:**\n",
      "This estimate stems from observed historical trends (2022-23 “tripledemic”), supportive evidence from the CDC’s RESP-NET, and consideration of seasonal viral behavior patterns. The 25% uncertainty reflects potential unexpected variations in virus interactions or public health interventions.\n"
