These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

AND Will the human condition change fundamentally before 2100?","body":"Resolution criteria for each question:\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that the United States of America has recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

Otherwise it resolves negatively.\\nThis question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.\\nThis question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

Recognition is generally considered valid if it is declared by law, or declared through a large international body such as the United Nations. If the Iran nuke question resolves positively or ambiguously, this question resolves ambiguously.\\nResolution Criteria\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

The obesity epidemic spread further in the five years leading up to 2017, although at a slower pace than before. Despite this, projections show a continuing increase of obesity in all OECD countries.\\nA nearly tenfold variation in obesity rates can be seen across OECD countries; as of 2016, in Japan the rate of obesity was just 4.2%, while in the US it was 40%. (See a graphic on this page for full OECD obesity rates).\\nThis question asks: Will any OECD country achieve a 10% or greater proportional reduction in the national rate of obesity, as compared to levels reported by the OECD for 2016, for three consecutive years before 1 January 2030?\\nResolution should cite a data release (from either the OECD itself or any of its 36 member states) that demonstrates that the national obesity rate of any OECD member country has fallen by 10% or more from 2016 levels for three consecutive years before 2030.\\nThis question refers to the percentage of the total adult population (aged 15 years and over) considered obese. Note that we\'re looking for a 10% proportional drop (e.g. if the initial percentage is 20%, we\'d be looking for a fall to 18%; if it were 40%, we would be looking for a drop to 36%).\\nIn the event of a positive resolution, the question should close retroactively one day prior to the release of information that causes the positive resolution.\\nIf one year goes unreported for a country, the years on each side are still considered consecutive. If the gap is greater than one year, the years on each side are not considered consecutive.\\nChangelog:\\n2020-09-17: added requirement for consecutive years, to mitigate noisy data.

Recognition is generally considered valid if it is declared by law, or declared through a large international body such as the United Nations. If the Iran nuke question resolves positively or ambiguously, this question resolves ambiguously.\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

(See a graphic on this page for full OECD obesity rates).\\nThis question asks: Will any OECD country achieve a 10% or greater proportional reduction in the national rate of obesity, as compared to levels reported by the OECD for 2016, for three consecutive years before 1 January 2030?\\nResolution should cite a data release (from either the OECD itself or any of its 36 member states) that demonstrates that the national obesity rate of any OECD member country has fallen by 10% or more from 2016 levels for three consecutive years before 2030.\\nThis question refers to the percentage of the total adult population (aged 15 years and over) considered obese. Note that we\'re looking for a 10% proportional drop (e.g. if the initial percentage is 20%, we\'d be looking for a fall to 18%; if it were 40%, we would be looking for a drop to 36%).\\nIn the event of a positive resolution, the question should close retroactively one day prior to the release of information that causes the positive resolution.\\nIf one year goes unreported for a country, the years on each side are still considered consecutive. If the gap is greater than one year, the years on each side are not considered consecutive.\\nChangelog:\\n2020-09-17: added requirement for consecutive years, to mitigate noisy data.

AND Will the human condition change fundamentally before 2100?","body":"Resolution criteria for each question:\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nThis question resolves positively if there is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.)\\nIf the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

The obesity epidemic spread further in the five years leading up to 2017, although at a slower pace than before. Despite this, projections show a continuing increase of obesity in all OECD countries.\\nA nearly tenfold variation in obesity rates can be seen across OECD countries; as of 2016, in Japan the rate of obesity was just 4.2%, while in the US it was 40%. (See a graphic on this page for full OECD obesity rates).\\nThis question asks: Will any OECD country achieve a 10% or greater proportional reduction in the national rate of obesity, as compared to levels reported by the OECD for 2016, for three consecutive years before 1 January 2030?\\nResolution should cite a data release (from either the OECD itself or any of its 36 member states) that demonstrates that the national obesity rate of any OECD member country has fallen by 10% or more from 2016 levels for three consecutive years before 2030.\\nThis question refers to the percentage of the total adult population (aged 15 years and over) considered obese. Note that we\'re looking for a 10% proportional drop (e.g. if the initial percentage is 20%, we\'d be looking for a fall to 18%; if it were 40%, we would be looking for a drop to 36%).\\nIn the event of a positive resolution, the question should close retroactively one day prior to the release of information that causes the positive resolution.\\nIf one year goes unreported for a country, the years on each side are still considered consecutive. If the gap is greater than one year, the years on each side are not considered consecutive.\\nChangelog:\\n2020-09-17: added requirement for consecutive years, to mitigate noisy data.

Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

The obesity epidemic spread further in the five years leading up to 2017, although at a slower pace than before. Despite this, projections show a continuing increase of obesity in all OECD countries.\\nA nearly tenfold variation in obesity rates can be seen across OECD countries; as of 2016, in Japan the rate of obesity was just 4.2%, while in the US it was 40%. (See a graphic on this page for full OECD obesity rates).\\nThis question asks: Will any OECD country achieve a 10% or greater proportional reduction in the national rate of obesity, as compared to levels reported by the OECD for 2016, for three consecutive years before 1 January 2030?\\nResolution should cite a data release (from either the OECD itself or any of its 36 member states) that demonstrates that the national obesity rate of any OECD member country has fallen by 10% or more from 2016 levels for three consecutive years before 2030.\\nThis question refers to the percentage of the total adult population (aged 15 years and over) considered obese. Note that we\'re looking for a 10% proportional drop (e.g. if the initial percentage is 20%, we\'d be looking for a fall to 18%; if it were 40%, we would be looking for a drop to 36%).\\nIn the event of a positive resolution, the question should close retroactively one day prior to the release of information that causes the positive resolution.\\nIf one year goes unreported for a country, the years on each side are still considered consecutive.

For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

Bostrom states the following:\n"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition."\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n"The human condition," for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2099, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1646', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

Bostrom states the following:\n"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition."\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n"The human condition," for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2099, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1646', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:
(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and negatively otherwise. Recognition is generally considered valid if it is declared by law, or declared through a large international body such as the United Nations. If the Iran nuke question resolves positively or ambiguously, this question resolves ambiguously.

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count.

You should then give me the NEGATION of the question, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if the original question would be answered NO, and vice versa. Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q). The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition. E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body! You cannot discard a single relevant detail.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. You can negate this normally, i.e. \'Which of these countries will not legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly negate such a combination with de Morgan\'s law.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will the United States recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that the United States of America has recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"}}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers.

Bostrom states the following:\n"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition."\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n"The human condition," for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively.

Bostrom states the following:\n"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition."\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n"The human condition," for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2099, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1646', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

You should then give me the NEGATION of the question, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if the original question would be answered NO, and vice versa. Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q). The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition. E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body! You cannot discard a single relevant detail.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. You can negate this normally, i.e. \'Which of these countries will not legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly negate such a combination with de Morgan\'s law.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will US greenhouse gas emissions be halved by 2030?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question resolves positively if there is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030.

This question will resolve negatively if either of the following occur:
(1) After 01-01-2030, there are no reliable media sources reporting that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve negatively if fewer than five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and positively otherwise. Recognition is generally considered valid if it is declared by law, or declared through a large international body such as the United Nations. If the Iran nuke question resolves positively or ambiguously, this question resolves ambiguously.

This question resolves positively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. The question resolves negatively if there is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.)
If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.
This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

You should then give me the NEGATION of the question, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if the original question would be answered NO, and vice versa. Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q). The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition. E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body! You cannot discard a single relevant detail.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. You can negate this normally, i.e. \'Which of these countries will not legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if at least one of the following occurs:
(a) There is no year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.
(b) The US government does not pass legislation or the US constitution has not been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
(c) Either Washington DC and Puerto Rico are officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, or the Republican Party does not control the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If Republicans do control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as Yes. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.
Fine Print
Commercial Animal farming is considered to be the branch of agriculture involving animals that are raised for the commerce of meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other physical products. For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.

Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will the United States recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that the United States of America has recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"},"Q":{"title":"Will there be a major famine in North Korea before 2025?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes in the event that before January 1, 2025, credible reports indicate that North Korea has suffered from a famine beginning no earlier than January 1, 2020 that has likely resulted in at least 250,000 deaths.

This question resolves positively if all of the following occur:
(a) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources.

(If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.
(b) The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive).

Commercial Animal farming is considered to be the branch of agriculture involving animals that are raised for the commerce of meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other physical products. For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.

question.body: Criteria for Resolution
This inquiry will be deemed affirmative if both of the subsequent conditions are met:
(1) Prior to January 1, 2030, trustworthy news outlets confirm that both the United States and Israel have acknowledged the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
(2) If the situation regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities concludes negatively (i.e., the Iranian government reliably claims it has developed a nuclear weapon or conducted a weapon test, as reported by the media), then this question will be considered affirmative if no fewer than five credible news sources report that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has legally recognized the State of Israel before January 1, 2031, and will be deemed negative otherwise. Recognition is typically regarded as legitimate if it is announced through legislation or through a significant international organization such as the United Nations. If the outcome regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities is positive or unclear, this question will have an ambiguous resolution.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This inquiry will be considered affirmative if there exists any year from 2022 to 2030 (inclusive) where the total economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions in the US (measured in CO₂ equivalents) are at least 50.00% lower than the levels recorded in 2005, based on a credible source that is not significantly contested by other trustworthy sources. Conversely, this question will be deemed negative if all credible reports (accessible to Metaculus users) indicate that the US's net emissions in every year from 2022 to 2030 exceeded 50% of the 2005 levels, and there is at least one credible report concerning the net emission levels in 2030. (In the absence of a report on net emission levels for 2030, we should refrain from making an ambiguous resolution on this question.)
Should the United States acquire or relinquish territories before 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be taken into account.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:
(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and negatively otherwise. Recognition is generally considered valid if it is declared by law, or declared through a large international body such as the United Nations. If the Iran nuke question resolves positively or ambiguously, this question resolves ambiguously.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if there is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.)
If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered

question.body: Resolution Criteria
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves negatively if fewer than five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves positively.
This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States not continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves negatively if the United States is not amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves negative.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as No if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is not repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.
(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)
Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.
The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data

Received the following response from OpenAI API: prob=0.15
question.body: Resolution Criteria
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.
This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.I will give you two forecasting questions with Yes/No answers. You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030?

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met before January 1st, 2050:
1. The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise, it resolves negatively.
2. There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths, or at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths. These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period. If either condition is not met, this question resolves negatively.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will be deemed true if all of the following conditions are met:
(a) There exists at least one year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) during which the United States' economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (measured in CO₂ equivalents) are at least 50.00% lower than the levels recorded in 2005, as per a credible source that is not significantly disputed by other trustworthy sources. The question will be considered false if all credible reports (accessible to Metaculus users) indicate that the US net emissions in each year from 2022 to 2030 exceeded 50% of the 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report concerning net emission levels in 2030. (If no report on net emission levels for 2030 is available, we should wait for one instead of resolving this question with uncertainty.) If the US undergoes territorial changes between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be taken into account.
(b) The US government enacts legislation or the US constitution is amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to outlaw commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico do not receive official statehood before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party retains control of the Senate from the start of the congressional term in 2023 until the end of the congressional term in 2031 (covering the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If the Republicans lose control of the Senate at any point during this timeframe, the question will resolve as No. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are formally admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.
Fine Print
Commercial animal farming refers to the segment of agriculture that deals with animals raised for the production of meat, fiber, milk, eggs, or other tangible goods. For instance, dairy cows are included as animal farming, while pet chickens or animals in zoos for entertainment are not. Both aquaculture (fish farming) and the capture of wild fish are also included for the resolution of this question.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

The question will be considered false if all credible reports (accessible to Metaculus users) indicate that the US net emissions in each year from 2022 to 2030 exceeded 50% of the 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report concerning net emission levels in 2030. (If no report on net emission levels for 2030 is available, we should wait for one instead of resolving this question with uncertainty.) If the US undergoes territorial changes between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be taken into account.\n(b) The US government enacts legislation or the US constitution is amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to outlaw commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.\n(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico do not receive official statehood before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party retains control of the Senate from the start of the congressional term in 2023 until the end of the congressional term in 2031 (covering the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If the Republicans lose control of the Senate at any point during this timeframe, the question will resolve as No. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are formally admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.\nFine Print\nCommercial animal farming refers to the segment of agriculture that deals with animals raised for the production of meat, fiber, milk, eggs, or other tangible goods. For instance, dairy cows are included as animal farming, while pet chickens or animals in zoos for entertainment are not. Both aquaculture (fish farming) and the capture of wild fish are also included for the resolution of this question.\nresolution_date: 2040-12-31 00:00:00+00:00\n'}]

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if all of the following occur:
(a) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.
(b) The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If Republicans do not control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as No. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.
Fine Print
Commercial Animal farming is considered to be the branch of agriculture involving animals that are raised for the commerce of meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other physical products. For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.

In particular:\n   - In case of events that happen at a fixed time (e.g. "Will France win the FIFA World Cup in 2026"), it should *never* be *before* the date when the event is scheduled to happen. Ideally it is exactly at the date. There can be *at most a month of leeway* to account for resolution issues and delays. If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it. In this case, the `body` should say the question resolves N/A if the resolution date comes and there was no resolution.\n\n- The resolution criteria should not be excessively vague or ambiguous, and should be consistent with the question.\n\nThe format of your response should be:\nreasoning: [reasoning here]\nvalid: [True/False]\n\nExample 1:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2020?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected as the president of the United States before January 1, 2020.\nresolution_date: 2020-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body (resolution criteria) is clear and consistent with the title.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 2:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if it happens.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body is too vague.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 3:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States before January 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2030.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution criteria are clear and consistent with the title.\nThe resolution date is consistent with the title and in the future.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 4:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2031.\nresolution_date: 2031-12-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is too late compared to when the body says the question will resolve. It is in December 2031, while the body says the question should resolve by January 2031.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 5:\ntitle: Will any member of Kanye West\'s family become the president of the United States by 2035?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West or any of his family members (including his wife, children, siblings and parents) is elected and...

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

This question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:
(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
(2) Before January 1, 2025, credible reports indicate that North Korea has suffered from a famine beginning no earlier than January 1, 2020 that has likely resulted in at least 250,000 deaths. The question will resolve as No if this does not occur.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.
(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)
Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.
The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if both of the following conditions are met: 
1. There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.)
2. By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880, as determined using reliable data sources such as NASA. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy this requirement would be 2095-2099, making the last possible resolution date around mid-2100.

This query will conclude and resolve one hour before any 28th amendment is enacted, should one be passed.

(b) The United States will continue to be among the 20 nations with the most considerable decline in state stability from 2019 to 2029, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index serves as a crucial gauge of government stability, published annually here.
As per the 2019 report (refer to page 11), during the period from 2009 to 2019, the US ranked #12 among the countries with the most rapid deterioration in the Fragile States Index. Although the US remained one of the more stable countries globally, the trend indicated a movement towards increased instability.
Will the United States persist in being among the 20 nations with the most significant deterioration in state stability from 2019 to 2029, as per the Fragile States Index?
This question will be answered affirmatively if the United States ranks among the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) in fragile state score during the 2019-2029 period.
If, for any reason, the Fund for Peace stops publishing this index, or if the index can no longer be historically compared, this question will be deemed ambiguous, unless the Fund for Peace designates a successor index that also indicates which 20 countries have deteriorated the most in stability from 2019 to 2029.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified entity, this question will be answered positively.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution will be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any point between January 1, 2019, and January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or altered in any manner through the process outlined in Article Five of the US Constitution.

In particular:\n   - In case of events that happen at a fixed time (e.g. "Will France win the FIFA World Cup in 2026"), it should *never* be *before* the date when the event is scheduled to happen. Ideally it is exactly at the date. There can be *at most a month of leeway* to account for resolution issues and delays. If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it. In this case, the `body` should say the question resolves N/A if the resolution date comes and there was no resolution.\n\n- The resolution criteria should not be excessively vague or ambiguous, and should be consistent with the question.\n\nThe format of your response should be:\nreasoning: [reasoning here]\nvalid: [True/False]\n\nExample 1:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2020?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected as the president of the United States before January 1, 2020.\nresolution_date: 2020-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body (resolution criteria) is clear and consistent with the title.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 2:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if it happens.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body is too vague.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 3:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States before January 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2030.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution criteria are clear and consistent with the title.\nThe resolution date is consistent with the title and in the future.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 4:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2031.\nresolution_date: 2031-12-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is too late compared to when the body says the question will resolve.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030.

The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030.

Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q). The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition. E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body!

Received the following response from OpenAI API: prob=0.01
question.body: Resolution Criteria
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.
This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

This question resolves positively if both of the following occur:
(1) All of the following happen:
(a) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources.
(b) The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If Republicans do not control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as No. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.
(2) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.

This question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:
(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and negatively otherwise. Recognition is generally considered valid if it is declared by law, or declared through a large international body such as the United Nations. If the Iran nuke question resolves positively or ambiguously, this question resolves ambiguously.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if either of the following occurs: (1) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) (2) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible, and the last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, with resolution around mid-2100.

You should then give me the NEGATION of the question, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if the original question would be answered NO, and vice versa. Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q). The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition. E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body! You cannot discard a single relevant detail.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. You can negate this normally, i.e. \'Which of these countries will not legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly negate such a combination with de Morgan\'s law.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will both of the following occur: (1) both the United States and Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030, and (2) Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:\\n(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\\n(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and negatively otherwise.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will all of the following occur: (a) a new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050, (b) the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index, and (c) the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\n(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:\\nThe US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992.

This question will resolve positively if at least one of the following does not occur:
(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that either the United States of America or Israel have not recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if fewer than five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and positively otherwise. Recognition is generally considered valid if it is declared by law, or declared through a large international body such as the United Nations. If the Iran nuke question resolves positively or ambiguously, this question resolves ambiguously.

This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur before January 1, 2050:
(a) Armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths. This will be determined if either of the following occur:
- There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
- There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.
In the context of this question, an armed conflict will be defined as a dispute that concerns a government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in an exchange of weapon fire or detonations
(b) No new amendment to the US Constitution is ratified. This will be determined if at least five reliable media outlets report that the US constitution did not receive a 28th amendment before January 1, 2050. This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.
This question will resolve as No otherwise.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if either of the following occurs:
(a) All of the following occur:
1. There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.
2. The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
3. Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If Republicans do not control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as No. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.
(b) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. (Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.) Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

You should then give me the NEGATION of the question, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if the original question would be answered NO, and vice versa. Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q). The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition. E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body! You cannot discard a single relevant detail.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. You can negate this normally, i.e. \'Which of these countries will not legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030.

You should then give me the conditional expression of these two questions, i.e. \'GIVEN P is true, then is Q true?\' P is the condition, Q is the outcome we are interested in. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible. If writing the whole thing in a single sentence becomes too long and cumbersome, you can write something like: Suppose the following is true: P. Then is Q true?\n - If the question allows for a simple rephrasing or factorization, go for it.\n - If Q is already a conditional expression, you can just combine the conditions. I.e.

Again if P and P2 is too long and cumbersome, you might want to write something like: Suppose the following is true: P. Then is Q true? And as always if a more natural formulation exists, always go for it.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain all relevant information in the question bodies. of BOTH base questions. You cannot leave out a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The conditional question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your conditional expression; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is more-or-less self-sufficient independent of the body.

This question resolves positively if all of the following occur:
(a) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources.

If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.
(b) The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive).

Fine Print
Commercial Animal farming is considered to be the branch of agriculture involving animals that are raised for the commerce of meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other physical products. For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.

The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.\n(b) The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.\n(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If Republicans do not control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as No. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.\nFine Print\nCommercial Animal farming is considered to be the branch of agriculture involving animals that are raised for the commerce of meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other physical products. For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.\n\nresolution_date: 2040-12-31 00:00:00+00:00\n'}]

For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question.

Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q).

For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body!

If Republicans do not control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as No. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.\\nFine Print\\nCommercial Animal farming is considered to be the branch of agriculture involving animals that are raised for the commerce of meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other physical products. For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.\\n"}}'}]

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will there be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn\'t exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(1) Before January 1, 2025, credible reports indicate that North Korea has suffered from a famine beginning no earlier than January 1, 2020 that has likely resulted in at least 250,000 deaths.
(2) At least one of the following does not occur:
(a) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that either the United States of America or Israel have not recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
(b) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if fewer than five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and positively otherwise. Recognition is generally considered valid if it is declared by law, or declared through a large international body such as the United Nations. If the Iran nuke question resolves positively or ambiguously, this question resolves ambiguously.
The question will resolve as No if either of these conditions is not met.

(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

(d) There will be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100:
This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.\nThis question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.\n\n(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:\nThe Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.\nAccording to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.\nWill the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?\nThis question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.\nIf for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.\nIf the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.\n\n(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.\n\n(d) There will be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100:\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.

messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.I will give you two forecasting questions with Yes/No answers. You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will both of the following occur: (1) both the United States and Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030, and (2) Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:\\n(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\\n(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and negatively otherwise.

You cannot leave out a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The conditional question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your conditional expression; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is more-or-less self-sufficient independent of the body.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:
(a) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.
(b) There are no years between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) are at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if there is any reliable report (that Metaculus users can find) that says that the US net emissions in at least one year between 2022 and 2030 were 50% or lower than 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if any of the following occur:
(a) There is no year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030 and all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.
(b) The US government does not pass legislation or the US constitution has not been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
(c) Either Washington DC or Puerto Rico are officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, or the Republican Party does not control the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If Republicans control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as Yes. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.
Fine Print
Commercial Animal farming is considered to be the branch of agriculture involving animals that are raised for the commerce of meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other physical products. For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.

question.body: Suppose the following is true: A new amendment to the US Constitution is ratified by 2050, as determined by at least five reliable media outlets reporting that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Then, will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050? 

Resolution criteria: This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occur:
1. There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
2. There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period. This question will resolve as No otherwise.

If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it.

This question resolves positively if either of the following occurs: (1) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.
(2) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalized relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.

The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.\n(2) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalized relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.\nresolution_date: 2100-12-31 00:00:00+00:00\n'}]

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:
1. The US Constitution has been amended, meaning at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.
2. At any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occur:
   - There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
   - There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.
This question will resolve as No if either of the conditions is not met.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will both of the following occur: (1) both the United States and Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030, and (2) Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:\\n(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\\n(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and negatively otherwise.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.
This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

(d) Will there be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100?
This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

You should then give me the conditional expression of these two questions, i.e. \'GIVEN P is true, then is Q true?\' P is the condition, Q is the outcome we are interested in. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible. If writing the whole thing in a single sentence becomes too long and cumbersome, you can write something like: Suppose the following is true: P. Then is Q true?\n - If the question allows for a simple rephrasing or factorization, go for it.\n - If Q is already a conditional expression, you can just combine the conditions. I.e. (Given P then (Given P2 then Q)) can just be written as (Given P AND P2 then Q). Again if P and P2 is too long and cumbersome, you might want to write something like: Suppose the following is true: P. Then is Q true? And as always if a more natural formulation exists, always go for it.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain all relevant information in the question bodies. of BOTH base questions. You cannot leave out a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The conditional question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your conditional expression; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is more-or-less self-sufficient independent of the body. It\'s OK if some detailed criteria/nuances/background info/ambiguity resolution are only in the body, but the title should be basically a well-formed question on its own.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030?

Received the following response from OpenAI API: prob=0.01
question.body: Resolution Criteria
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.
This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if both of the following occur:
(a) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.
(b) Any of the following occur:
  1. There is no year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030 and all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.
  2. The US government does not pass legislation or the US constitution has not been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
  3. Either Washington DC or Puerto Rico are officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, or the Republican Party does not control the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If Republicans control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as Yes. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.
Fine Print
Commercial Animal farming is considered to be the branch of agriculture involving animals that are raised for the commerce of meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other physical products. For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.

You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body.

The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition.

For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body!

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if there is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.)

If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered. 

Additionally, this question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. 
(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)
Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalized relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.
The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.

For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body.

Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030?

This question resolves positively if either of the following occurs:
(a) All of the following occur:
1. There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources.

If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.
2. The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
3. Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If Republicans do not control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as No. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.
(b) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question resolves positively if all of the following occur:
(a) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.
(b) The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.
(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive). If Republicans do not control the Senate at any point during that period, this question will resolve as No. If both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are officially admitted to the United States on or before December 31, 2029, this question will resolve as Ambiguous.
Fine Print
Commercial Animal farming is considered to be the branch of agriculture involving animals that are raised for the commerce of meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other physical products. For example, dairy cows should count as animal farming, but not pet chickens or animals kept in zoos for entertainment purposes. Both aquaculture (fish-farming) and fishing for wild fish should also count for resolution of this question.

In particular:\n   - In case of events that happen at a fixed time (e.g. "Will France win the FIFA World Cup in 2026"), it should *never* be *before* the date when the event is scheduled to happen. Ideally it is exactly at the date. There can be *at most a month of leeway* to account for resolution issues and delays. If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

Received the following response from OpenAI API: prob=0.1
question.body: Resolution Criteria
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.
This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States not continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States not continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves positively if the United States is not amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves negative.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution not be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is not repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030.

For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will US greenhouse gas emissions be halved by 2030, will commercial animal farming be prohibited in the US before 2041, and if Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not admitted as new states, will Republicans hold the Senate from 2022 to 2030?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question resolves positively if all of the following occur:\\n(a) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO₂ equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:

1. By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. (Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.) Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.

2. Not all of the following occur:
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050: The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively. This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States not continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index: The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here. According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability. Will the United States not continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index? This question resolves positively if the United States is not amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period. If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability. If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves negative.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution not be amended or repealed before 2025: This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is not repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others.

By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. (Note that 1880 isn\'t exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.) Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.\n\n2. Not all of the following occur:\n(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050: The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively. This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.\n\n(b) The United States not continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index: The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here. According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability. Will the United States not continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index? This question resolves positively if the United States is not amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period. If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability. If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves negative.\n\n(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution not be amended or repealed before 2025: This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is not repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.\nresolution_date: 2100-12-31 00:00:00+00:00\n'}]

You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will all of the following occur: (a) a new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050, (b) the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index, and (c) the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\n(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:\\nThe US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992.

Received the following response from OpenAI API: prob=0.25
question.body: Resolution Criteria
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.
This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

In particular:\n   - In case of events that happen at a fixed time (e.g. "Will France win the FIFA World Cup in 2026"), it should *never* be *before* the date when the event is scheduled to happen. Ideally it is exactly at the date. There can be *at most a month of leeway* to account for resolution issues and delays. If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it. In this case, the `body` should say the question resolves N/A if the resolution date comes and there was no resolution.\n\n- The resolution criteria should not be excessively vague or ambiguous, and should be consistent with the question.\n\nThe format of your response should be:\nreasoning: [reasoning here]\nvalid: [True/False]\n\nExample 1:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2020?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected as the president of the United States before January 1, 2020.\nresolution_date: 2020-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body (resolution criteria) is clear and consistent with the title.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 2:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if it happens.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body is too vague.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 3:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States before January 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2030.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution criteria are clear and consistent with the title.\nThe resolution date is consistent with the title and in the future.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 4:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2031.\nresolution_date: 2031-12-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is too late compared to when the body says the question will resolve.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

(Given P then (Given P2 then Q)) can just be written as (Given P AND P2 then Q). Again if P and P2 is too long and cumbersome, you might want to write something like: Suppose the following is true: P. Then is Q true? And as always if a more natural formulation exists, always go for it.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain all relevant information in the question bodies. of BOTH base questions. You cannot leave out a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The conditional question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your conditional expression; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is more-or-less self-sufficient independent of the body. It\'s OK if some detailed criteria/nuances/background info/ambiguity resolution are only in the body, but the title should be basically a well-formed question on its own.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will all of the following occur: (a) a new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050, (b) the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index, and (c) the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\n(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:\\nThe US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992.

(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution is ratified by 2050, which resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. 
(b) The United States continues to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index, resolving positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.
This question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.

(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:
The Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.
According to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.
Will the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?
This question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.
If for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.
If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.

(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.

(d) Will there be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100?:
This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.
(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)
Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.
The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.

Show More\n\nresolution_date: 2035-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: There is a "Show More" instead of the end of the resolution criteria.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 6:\ntitle: Will a new strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential be identified by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, a new strain of influenza virus is identified that meets the following criteria: \n- The strain must be genetically distinct from previously identified strains, with genetic differences significant enough to be considered a new strain by the World Health Organization (WHO) or a similar authoritative body.\n- The strain must have demonstrated the ability to cause human infection and have the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.\n- The strain must be assessed by the WHO or a similar authoritative body as having pandemic potential, meaning it has a significant risk of causing widespread illness across multiple countries or continents.\nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution.\nresolution_date: 2030-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "Pandemic potential" is way too subjective; it is not a clearly objective threshold. \nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution." is not good because it is not clear on what exactly they should agree on.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 7:\ntitle: Will DeepMind develop an AI with the capability to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, DeepMind has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that has been publicly recognized to significantly disrupt at least one major industry.  The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018. This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2026, the French national football team (senior, not youth or women\'s) has won either the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA European Championship.\nresolution_date: 2026-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is fine. The body is clear; there are multiple distinct pathways to resolution, but all are important for the question. The body includes a bit of background information that is not necessary for the question, but it is not harmful.\nvalid: True\n-----\n\ntitle: Will both of the following occur: (a) a new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050, (b) the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index, and (c) the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025, and (d) will there be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100?\nbody: Resolution Criteria\n(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:\nThe US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992. This question resolves positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that before January 1st 2050 the US constitution received a 28th amendment. Otherwise it resolves negatively.\nThis question will close and resolve 1 hour before any 28th amendment becomes law, if one does.\n\n(b) The United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index:\nThe Fragile State Index is an important metric of government stability. It is published every year here.\nAccording to the 2019 report (see page 11), over the 2009 to 2019 period, The US was #12 among the countries with the most rapidly deteriorating Fragile States Index. The US was still among the more stable nations in the world but the trend was clearly in the direction of less stability.\nWill the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index?\nThis question resolves positively if the United States is amongst the 20 countries with the largest long-term increase (worsening) of fragile state score over the 2019-2029 period.\nIf for some reason, Fund for Peace ceases to publish this index, or their index can no longer be compared historically this question will be ambiguous, unless the Fund For Peace designates a successor index that also shows which 20 countries have deteriorated the most over the period 2019 to 2029 from a standpoint of stability.\nIf the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.\n\n(c) The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2025, the Second Amendment is repealed, amended, or modified in any way through the procedure in Article Five of the US Constitution.\n\n(d) Will there be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100?:\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\n(Note that 1880 isn\'t exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.\nThe last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.\nresolution_date: 2100-12-31 00:00:00+00:00\n'}]
