Then is it true that there will be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?\\nResolution Criteria\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

AND Before 2025, will at least two public health agencies claim that China deliberately misreported COVID-19 infections?","body":"Resolution criteria for each question:\\n\\nSuppose the following is true: Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045, and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. Extraterrestrial life must be (a) living currently and (b) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft.

Then, will prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050?\\nResolution Criteria\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count.

If this has not happened before January 1, 2050, this part will resolve as No.\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

Then is the USA entering a second civil war before 2031?\\nResolution Criteria\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

Note that we\'re looking for a 10% proportional drop (e.g. if the initial percentage is 20%, we\'d be looking for a fall to 18%; if it were 40%, we would be looking for a drop to 36%).\\nIn the event of a positive resolution, the question should close retroactively one day prior to the release of information that causes the positive resolution.\\nIf one year goes unreported for a country, the years on each side are still considered consecutive.

Then is it true that there will be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count.

This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\nWorld Health Organization\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\nThe Centre for Health Protection\nRobert Koch Institute\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\nPublic Health England\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\n", resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3715', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively.

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count.

Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers.

(See a graphic on this page for full OECD obesity rates).\\nThis question asks: Will any OECD country achieve a 10% or greater proportional reduction in the national rate of obesity, as compared to levels reported by the OECD for 2016, for three consecutive years before 1 January 2030?\\nResolution should cite a data release (from either the OECD itself or any of its 36 member states) that demonstrates that the national obesity rate of any OECD member country has fallen by 10% or more from 2016 levels for three consecutive years before 2030.\\nThis question refers to the percentage of the total adult population (aged 15 years and over) considered obese. Note that we\'re looking for a 10% proportional drop (e.g. if the initial percentage is 20%, we\'d be looking for a fall to 18%; if it were 40%, we would be looking for a drop to 36%).\\nIn the event of a positive resolution, the question should close retroactively one day prior to the release of information that causes the positive resolution.\\nIf one year goes unreported for a country, the years on each side are still considered consecutive.

An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers.

Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers.

Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers.

Then is the USA entering a second civil war before 2031?\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\nWorld Health Organization\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\nThe Centre for Health Protection\nRobert Koch Institute\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\nPublic Health England\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\n", resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3715', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]
reasons=['The potential for a civil war in the USA and the accusations against China regarding COVID-19 misreporting could both be influenced by global perceptions of governmental credibility and stability.

Note that we\'re looking for a 10% proportional drop (e.g. if the initial percentage is 20%, we\'d be looking for a fall to 18%; if it were 40%, we would be looking for a drop to 36%).\\nIn the event of a positive resolution, the question should close retroactively one day prior to the release of information that causes the positive resolution.\\nIf one year goes unreported for a country, the years on each side are still considered consecutive. If the gap is greater than one year, the years on each side are not considered consecutive.\\nChangelog:\\n2020-09-17: added requirement for consecutive years, to mitigate noisy data.

Suicides do not count towards the death count.\\n\\nResolution Criteria\\nNick Bostrom, philosopher and Founding Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, argues that only two events since the dawn of humanity have fundamentally changed the human condition: the Agricultural Revolution that took place approximately 10,000 years ago, and the Industrial Revolution which took place from roughly 1760-1840. Bostrom states the following:\\n\\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\\n\\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\\n\\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition.\\"\\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\\n\\"The human condition,\\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\\nResolution\\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\\n"}'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\nWorld Health Organization\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\nThe Centre for Health Protection\nRobert Koch Institute\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\nPublic Health England\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\n", resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3715', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

Bostrom states the following:\n"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition."\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n"The human condition," for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2099, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1646', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if there is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory
Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Suppose the following is true: US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before 2040. Then is it true that there will be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?

Bostrom states the following:\n"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition."\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n"The human condition," for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2099, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1646', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(a) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.
(b) There is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
- Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
- Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Bostrom states the following:\n"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition."\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n"The human condition," for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2099, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1646', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

Bostrom states the following:\n"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition."\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n"The human condition," for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2099, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1646', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print for P:
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is invoked.
While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print for Q:
Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

Suppose the following is true: There is a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120. Then is the USA entering a second civil war before 2031?

Bostrom states the following:\n"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody\'s still in a Malthusian condition."\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n"The human condition," for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2099, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='metaculus', url='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1646', metadata={'topics': [], 'background_info': ''}, resolution=None)]

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
(b) All of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
- The Insurrection Act is invoked.
- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print
For condition (a), we'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.
For condition (b), any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

In this case, the `body` should say the question resolves N/A if the resolution date comes and there was no resolution.\n\n- The resolution criteria should not be excessively vague or ambiguous, and should be consistent with the question.\n\nThe format of your response should be:\nreasoning: [reasoning here]\nvalid: [True/False]\n\nExample 1:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2020?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected as the president of the United States before January 1, 2020.\nresolution_date: 2020-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body (resolution criteria) is clear and consistent with the title.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 2:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if it happens.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body is too vague.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 3:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States before January 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2030.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution criteria are clear and consistent with the title.\nThe resolution date is consistent with the title and in the future.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 4:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2031.\nresolution_date: 2031-12-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is too late compared to when the body says the question will resolve. It is in December 2031, while the body says the question should resolve by January 2031.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 5:\ntitle: Will any member of Kanye West\'s family become the president of the United States by 2035?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West or any of his family members (including his wife, children, siblings and parents) is elected and...

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if there is no armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory
Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Suppose the following is true: US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before 2040. Then is it true that there will be no global thermonuclear war by 2070?

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if neither of the following occur:
(a) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.
(b) There is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where neither of the following conditions are true:
- Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
- Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body! You cannot discard a single relevant detail.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. You can negate this normally, i.e. \'Which of these countries will not legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly negate such a combination with de Morgan\'s law.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will both of the following occur: (a) There be a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120 and (b) The USA enter a second civil war before 2031?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:\\n(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\\n(b) All of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\\n- The Insurrection Act is invoked.\\n- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\\n- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\\nFine Print\\nFor condition (a), we\'ll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\\nFor condition (b), any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if at least one of the following occurs:
(a) Humanity does not discover convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 or does so after detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this part will resolve as Yes. If extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this part will resolve as No. Note: extraterrestrial life must be (i) living currently and (ii) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.
(b) Prominent, highly respected scientific organizations do not announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050. If this has happened before January 1, 2050, this part will resolve as Yes.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if there is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory
Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Suppose the following is true: US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before 2040. Then is it true that there will be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print for P:
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if any of the following conditions are not met before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is not invoked.
While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are not at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
Not all of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print for Q:
Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

Suppose the following is true: There is a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120. Then is the USA not entering a second civil war before 2031?

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this part will resolve as No. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this part will be Annulled. Note: extraterrestrial life must be (i) living currently and (ii) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.
(b) Prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050. If this has not happened before January 1, 2050, this part will resolve as No.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print for P:
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is invoked.
While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print for Q:
Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

Suppose the following is true: There is a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120. Then is the USA entering a second civil war before 2031?

This inquiry will be considered affirmative if both of the subsequent events happen:
(a) At any point from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, the average life expectancy at birth in the US (for both genders) falls below 75 years, as reported by the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. A formal declaration from any of these organizations will suffice to resolve the question.
(b) An armed conflict arises before January 1, 2070, in which at least one of the following scenarios is true:
- Three nations each set off a minimum of 10 nuclear weapons with a yield of at least 10 kilotons outside their own borders.
- Two nations each set off at least 50 nuclear weapons with a yield of at least 10 kilotons outside their own borders.
These scenarios are designed to exclude a two-party regional nuclear conflict, such as one between India and Pakistan, or Israel and another nation, or the UK and France, as catastrophic as those would be.
As with many inquiries that have a positive resolution condition that might prevent earning points on Metaculus, predictors are encouraged to make predictions in good faith, as points will not be granted until 2070 regardless.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

question.body: Criteria for determining P:
This question will be answered with Yes if, at any point from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, the life expectancy at birth (average for both genders) in the US is recorded as less than 75 years, as per the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. A formal announcement from any of these organizations will suffice to resolve the inquiry.

Criteria for determining Q:
This question will be answered with Yes if there is a military confrontation occurring before January 1, 2070 that meets either of the following criteria:
Three nations each launch at least 10 nuclear weapons with a minimum yield of 10 kilotons outside their own borders.
Two nations each launch at least 50 nuclear weapons with a minimum yield of 10 kilotons outside their own borders.
These criteria are established to exclude a two-nation regional nuclear conflict, such as one between India and Pakistan, or Israel and another nation, or the UK and France, even though such a scenario would be catastrophic.
As with many inquiries that have a condition for positive resolution which may prevent the awarding of points on Metaculus, participants are encouraged to make predictions in good faith, as points will not be granted until 2070 in any case.

Assuming the following holds: US life expectancy at birth for both genders falls below 75 years before 2040. Is it then the case that a global thermonuclear war will take place by 2070?

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extra terrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this question will resolve as No. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this question will be Annulled.
Note: extraterrestrial life must be (a) living currently and (b) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
(b) All of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
- The Insurrection Act is invoked.
- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print
For condition (a), we'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.
For condition (b), any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(a) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.
(b) There is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
- Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
- Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Extraterrestrial life must be (a) living currently and (b) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means. Then, will prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050?

question.body: Criteria for determining the outcome of P:
This inquiry will be deemed affirmative if there exists a stretch of at least 12 uninterrupted months before the conclusion of 2120 during which no public stock exchanges in the US are available for trading.
Additional details for P:
We will refer to the definition of stock market/exchange as outlined on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market encompasses the various markets and exchanges where the regular buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly traded companies occur.

Criteria for determining the outcome of Q:
This inquiry will be considered a Yes if all the following conditions are satisfied before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is activated.
During the activation of the Insurrection Act, there are at least 500 fatalities within a 6-month timeframe due to armed confrontations between US citizens and a segment of the US military, national guard, or in clashes among such entities.
All of these fatalities happen in one or more US states (including DC).
Additional details for Q:
Any confrontations involving the US military and foreign armed forces will not be factored into this question. Confrontations between the US military and US citizens, potentially aided by other nations with weaponry or resources, will be included.
Clashes involving civilians and local law enforcement will be excluded unless there are active military forces in the area providing mutual assistance.
Fatalities will be counted across all states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. Newly admitted states will be included, while states that secede or are removed will not. Suicides will not be included in the death toll.

This question will be considered Yes if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) Convincing evidence of life is discovered on Europa by humanity prior to January 1, 2045, and this discovery occurs before any other extraterrestrial life is detected in the universe. If credible extraterrestrial life is found elsewhere before it is found on Europa, this component will resolve as No. If no extraterrestrial life is identified before 2045, this component will be Annulled. Note: the extraterrestrial life must be (i) currently alive and (ii) not likely to have come from contamination by Earth spacecraft. This allows for the possibility of life that may have been transported from Earth through other natural means.
(b) Renowned and respected scientific organizations declare that unambiguous evidence of either current or past life on Mars has been found, independent of any life that may have been transported from Earth through human missions, before January 1, 2050. If this declaration has not occurred before January 1, 2050, this component will resolve as No.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if there is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory
Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Suppose the following is true: US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before 2040. Then is it true that there will be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.
(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)
Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.
The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data

You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
The COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.
This latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.
Will at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?
This question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)
World Health Organization
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
The Centre for Health Protection
Robert Koch Institute
The National Institute of Infectious Diseases
Public Health England
The National Centre for Infectious Diseases
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Korea
The Public Health Agency of Canada
In case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.
The relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.
This question has a short-fuse sister.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this part will resolve as No. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this part will be Annulled. Note: extraterrestrial life must be (i) living currently and (ii) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.
(b) Prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050. If this has not happened before January 1, 2050, this part will resolve as No.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This inquiry will be considered affirmative if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) There exists a span of at least 12 continuous months before the conclusion of 2120 during which no public US stock exchanges are operational for trading.
(b) All of the subsequent conditions are fulfilled before January 1, 2031:
- The Insurrection Act is enforced.
- During the enforcement of the Insurrection Act, a minimum of 500 fatalities occur within a 6 month timeframe due to armed confrontations between US citizens and a segment of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts among such entities.
- All of these fatalities take place in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print
For condition (a), we will refer to the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market encompasses the array of markets and exchanges where the routine activities of buying, selling, and issuing shares of publicly-held companies occur.
For condition (b), any confrontations between the US military and the armed forces of another nation will not be taken into account in this question. Confrontations involving the US military and US citizens, possibly aided by foreign nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Engagements between civilians and local law enforcement will not be considered, unless there are active military forces in the area providing mutual assistance.
Fatalities are counted across all states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. Newly admitted states will be included, while states that secede or are removed will not be counted. Suicides are excluded from the death tally.

This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occur:
There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.
This question will resolves as No otherwise.
In the context of this question, an armed conflict will be defined as a dispute that concerns a government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in an exchange of weapon fire or detonations

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Conditional on US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falling below 75 years before 2040, will there be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?","body":"Resolution Criteria for P:\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}}'}]

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print for P:
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is invoked.
While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print for Q:
Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

Suppose the following is true: There is a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120. Then is the USA entering a second civil war before 2031?

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.
(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)
Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.
The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
(b) All of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
- The Insurrection Act is invoked.
- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print
For condition (a), we'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.
For condition (b), any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if all of the following occur:
(a) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.
(b) There is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
- Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
- Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
(c) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will both of the following occur: (a) Europa will be the first place humanity will discover extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045, and (b) we will find life on Mars by 2050?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:\\n(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following conditions are met: (1) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve this part of the question. (2) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880, with data for resolution coming from NASA, if possible.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Conditional on there being a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120, will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?","body":"Resolution Criteria for P:\\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\\nFine Print for P:\\nWe\'ll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\\n\\nResolution Criteria for Q:\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\\nThe Insurrection Act is invoked.\\nWhile the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\\nAll of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\\nFine Print for Q:\\nAny conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:
1. There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
2. At any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occurs:
   a. There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
   b. There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.

The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018. This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2026, the French national football team (senior, not youth or women\'s) has won either the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA European Championship.\nresolution_date: 2026-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is fine. The body is clear; there are multiple distinct pathways to resolution, but all are important for the question. The body includes a bit of background information that is not necessary for the question, but it is not harmful.\nvalid: True\n-----\n\ntitle: Will either of the following occur: (a) Conditional on Europa being the first place humanity discovers extraterrestrial life before 2045, will we find life on Mars by 2050? (b) Will we detect an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% oxygen atmosphere before 2030?\nbody: Suppose the following is true: Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045, and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. Extraterrestrial life must be (a) living currently and (b) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means. Then, will prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050? Also, this question will resolve as Yes if any exoplanet with >5% O2 atmosphere is found before January 1, 2030.\nresolution_date: 2050-12-31 00:00:00+00:00\n'}]

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}}'}]

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this part will resolve as No. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this part will be Annulled. Note: extraterrestrial life must be (i) living currently and (ii) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.
(b) Any exoplanet with >5% O2 atmosphere is found before January 1, 2030.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will there be a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\\nFine Print\\nWe\'ll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\\n"},"Q":{"title":"Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People\'s Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occur:\\nThere are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People\'s Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\\nThere are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People\'s Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\\nThese 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.\\nThis question will resolves as No otherwise.\\nIn the context of this question, an armed conflict will be defined as a dispute that concerns a government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in an exchange of weapon fire or detonations\\n"}}'}]

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print for P:
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.
(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)
Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.
The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.

This question will resolve as Yes if humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extra terrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this question will resolve as No. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this question will be Annulled.
Note: extraterrestrial life must be (a) living currently and (b) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. The relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.

Show More\n\nresolution_date: 2035-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: There is a "Show More" instead of the end of the resolution criteria.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 6:\ntitle: Will a new strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential be identified by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, a new strain of influenza virus is identified that meets the following criteria: \n- The strain must be genetically distinct from previously identified strains, with genetic differences significant enough to be considered a new strain by the World Health Organization (WHO) or a similar authoritative body.\n- The strain must have demonstrated the ability to cause human infection and have the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.\n- The strain must be assessed by the WHO or a similar authoritative body as having pandemic potential, meaning it has a significant risk of causing widespread illness across multiple countries or continents.\nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution.\nresolution_date: 2030-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "Pandemic potential" is way too subjective; it is not a clearly objective threshold. \nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution." is not good because it is not clear on what exactly they should agree on.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 7:\ntitle: Will DeepMind develop an AI with the capability to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, DeepMind has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that has been publicly recognized to significantly disrupt at least one major industry.  The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.\n\nResolution Criteria for Q:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count.

messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.I will give you two forecasting questions with Yes/No answers. You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will both of the following occur: (a) Europa will be the first place humanity will discover extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045, and (b) we will find life on Mars by 2050?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:\\n(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if either of the following occurs: (1) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading. (2) At any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occurs: (a) There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths. (b) There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths. These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.

Show More\n\nresolution_date: 2035-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: There is a "Show More" instead of the end of the resolution criteria.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 6:\ntitle: Will a new strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential be identified by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, a new strain of influenza virus is identified that meets the following criteria: \n- The strain must be genetically distinct from previously identified strains, with genetic differences significant enough to be considered a new strain by the World Health Organization (WHO) or a similar authoritative body.\n- The strain must have demonstrated the ability to cause human infection and have the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.\n- The strain must be assessed by the WHO or a similar authoritative body as having pandemic potential, meaning it has a significant risk of causing widespread illness across multiple countries or continents.\nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution.\nresolution_date: 2030-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "Pandemic potential" is way too subjective; it is not a clearly objective threshold. \nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution." is not good because it is not clear on what exactly they should agree on.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 7:\ntitle: Will DeepMind develop an AI with the capability to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, DeepMind has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that has been publicly recognized to significantly disrupt at least one major industry.  The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018. This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2026, the French national football team (senior, not youth or women\'s) has won either the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA European Championship.\nresolution_date: 2026-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is fine.

(2) At any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occurs: (a) There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People\'s Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths. (b) There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People\'s Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.

E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body! You cannot discard a single relevant detail.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. You can negate this normally, i.e. \'Which of these countries will not legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly negate such a combination with de Morgan\'s law.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will Europa be the first place humanity will discover extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extra terrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(a) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.
(b) There is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
- Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
- Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Prompt: {"title":"Before 2025, will at least two public health agencies claim that China deliberately misreported COVID-19 infections?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the disease's spread through the population.\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\nWorld Health Organization\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\nThe Centre for Health Protection\nRobert Koch Institute\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\nPublic Health England\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\n"}

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}'}]

This question will resolve as Yes if humanity does not discover convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 or does so after detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this question will resolve as Yes. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this question will be Annulled.
Note: extraterrestrial life must be (a) living currently and (b) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.

"20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means. Then, will prominent, highly respected scientific organizations not announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050?

This question will resolve positively if either of the following conditions are met:
(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading and the USA enters a second civil war before January 1, 2031, with the following conditions:
- The Insurrection Act is invoked.
- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
(b) Before January 1, 2025, credible reports indicate that North Korea has suffered from a famine beginning no earlier than January 1, 2020 that has likely resulted in at least 250,000 deaths.

You should then give me the NEGATION of the question, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if the original question would be answered NO, and vice versa. Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q). The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition. E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if there is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory
Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Suppose the following is true: US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before 2040. Then is it true that there will be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?

Fine Print for (a):
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for (b):
This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.
(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)
Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.
The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.

Show More\n\nresolution_date: 2035-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: There is a "Show More" instead of the end of the resolution criteria.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 6:\ntitle: Will a new strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential be identified by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, a new strain of influenza virus is identified that meets the following criteria: \n- The strain must be genetically distinct from previously identified strains, with genetic differences significant enough to be considered a new strain by the World Health Organization (WHO) or a similar authoritative body.\n- The strain must have demonstrated the ability to cause human infection and have the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.\n- The strain must be assessed by the WHO or a similar authoritative body as having pandemic potential, meaning it has a significant risk of causing widespread illness across multiple countries or continents.\nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution.\nresolution_date: 2030-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "Pandemic potential" is way too subjective; it is not a clearly objective threshold. \nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution." is not good because it is not clear on what exactly they should agree on.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 7:\ntitle: Will DeepMind develop an AI with the capability to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, DeepMind has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that has been publicly recognized to significantly disrupt at least one major industry.  The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018. This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2026, the French national football team (senior, not youth or women\'s) has won either the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA European Championship.\nresolution_date: 2026-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is fine. The body is clear; there are multiple distinct pathways to resolution, but all are important for the question. The body includes a bit of background information that is not necessary for the question, but it is not harmful.\nvalid: True\n-----\n\ntitle: Will either of the following occur: (a) Given there is a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120, will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031? (b) Will there be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100?\nbody: Resolution Criteria for (a):\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\nFine Print for (a):\nWe\'ll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\n\nResolution Criteria for (b):\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\n(Note that 1880 isn\'t exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.\nThe last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.\nresolution_date: 2119-12-31 00:00:00+00:00\n'}]

Show More\n\nresolution_date: 2035-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: There is a "Show More" instead of the end of the resolution criteria.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 6:\ntitle: Will a new strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential be identified by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, a new strain of influenza virus is identified that meets the following criteria: \n- The strain must be genetically distinct from previously identified strains, with genetic differences significant enough to be considered a new strain by the World Health Organization (WHO) or a similar authoritative body.\n- The strain must have demonstrated the ability to cause human infection and have the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.\n- The strain must be assessed by the WHO or a similar authoritative body as having pandemic potential, meaning it has a significant risk of causing widespread illness across multiple countries or continents.\nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution.\nresolution_date: 2030-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "Pandemic potential" is way too subjective; it is not a clearly objective threshold. \nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution." is not good because it is not clear on what exactly they should agree on.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 7:\ntitle: Will DeepMind develop an AI with the capability to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, DeepMind has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that has been publicly recognized to significantly disrupt at least one major industry.  The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018. This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2026, the French national football team (senior, not youth or women\'s) has won either the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA European Championship.\nresolution_date: 2026-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is fine. The body is clear; there are multiple distinct pathways to resolution, but all are important for the question. The body includes a bit of background information that is not necessary for the question, but it is not harmful.\nvalid: True\n-----\n\ntitle: Will US life expectancy at birth for both sexes not fall below 75 years before 2040?\nbody: Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is 75 years or more, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant. I will give you a forecasting question with Yes/No answer. You should then give me the NEGATION of the question, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if the original question would be answered NO, and vice versa. Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q). The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition. E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body! You cannot discard a single relevant detail.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. You can negate this normally, i.e. \'Which of these countries will not legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly negate such a combination with de Morgan\'s law.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Conditional on US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falling below 75 years before 2040, will there be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?","body":"Resolution Criteria for P:\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if neither of the following occur:
(a) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.
(b) There is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
- Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
- Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant. I will give you a forecasting question with Yes/No answer. You should then give me the NEGATION of the question, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if the original question would be answered NO, and vice versa. Notes to keep in mind:\n- When negating compound questions, be careful to apply de Morgan\'s law correctly. The negation of (P OR Q) is (NOT P AND NOT Q). The negation of (P AND Q) is (NOT P OR NOT Q).\n- In a conditional question, do not negate the condition. E.g. \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be less than 15 degrees Celsius?\' should be negated to \'If it rains tomorrow, will the temperature be 15 degrees Celsius or more?\'.\n- The negation of \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of X?\' is usually \'Will there be no proof/evidence/reports of X?\', not \'Will there be proof/evidence/reports of not X?.\' This also applies to the resolution criteria: \'Resolves YES if there is proof/evidence reports of X\' should be negated to \'Resolves YES if there is no proof/evidence/reports of X\' unless explicit resolution criteria are given for the original question to resolve NO, in which case those explicit criteria should be given as the resolution criteria for the negated question.\n- If applicable, the different parts of the question should be negated one to one. For example the new title should be an negation of the original title. Body questions should be negations of the original body questions. Statements / background information would generally be kept the same.\n- Pay attention to correctly negate existential and universal quantifiers. For example, the negation of \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, exceed 1 trillion USD?\' is \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth never exceed 1 trillion USD before 2050?\', and NOT \'Will Elon Musk\'s net worth, at any point before 2050, not exceed 1 trillion USD?\'.\n- Make sure you retain ALL the information in the question title and body! You cannot discard a single relevant detail.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. You can negate this normally, i.e. \'Which of these countries will not legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly negate such a combination with de Morgan\'s law.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will there be a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\\nFine Print\\nWe\'ll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\\n"}}'}]

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
(b) All of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
- The Insurrection Act is invoked.
- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print
For condition (a), we'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.
For condition (b), any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(1) Any exoplanet with >5% O2 atmosphere is found before January 1, 2030.
(2) Humanity does not discover convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 or does so after detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this question will resolve as Yes. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this question will be Annulled.
Note: extraterrestrial life must be (a) living currently and (b) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will there be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn\'t exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print for P:
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is invoked.
While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print for Q:
Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

Suppose the following is true: There is a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120. Then is the USA entering a second civil war before 2031?

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if there is no armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Suppose the following is true: US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before 2040. Then is it true that there will not be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?

Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will there be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn\'t exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

In particular:\n   - In case of events that happen at a fixed time (e.g. "Will France win the FIFA World Cup in 2026"), it should *never* be *before* the date when the event is scheduled to happen. Ideally it is exactly at the date. There can be *at most a month of leeway* to account for resolution issues and delays. If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it. In this case, the `body` should say the question resolves N/A if the resolution date comes and there was no resolution.\n\n- The resolution criteria should not be excessively vague or ambiguous, and should be consistent with the question.\n\nThe format of your response should be:\nreasoning: [reasoning here]\nvalid: [True/False]\n\nExample 1:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2020?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected as the president of the United States before January 1, 2020.\nresolution_date: 2020-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body (resolution criteria) is clear and consistent with the title.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 2:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if it happens.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body is too vague.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 3:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States before January 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2030.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution criteria are clear and consistent with the title.\nThe resolution date is consistent with the title and in the future.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 4:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2031.\nresolution_date: 2031-12-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is too late compared to when the body says the question will resolve. It is in December 2031, while the body says the question should resolve by January 2031.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 5:\ntitle: Will any member of Kanye West\'s family become the president of the United States by 2035?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West or any of his family members (including his wife, children, siblings and parents) is elected and... Show More\n\nresolution_date: 2035-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: There is a "Show More" instead of the end of the resolution criteria.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 6:\ntitle: Will a new strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential be identified by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, a new strain of influenza virus is identified that meets the following criteria: \n- The strain must be genetically distinct from previously identified strains, with genetic differences significant enough to be considered a new strain by the World Health Organization (WHO) or a similar authoritative body.\n- The strain must have demonstrated the ability to cause human infection and have the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.\n- The strain must be assessed by the WHO or a similar authoritative body as having pandemic potential, meaning it has a significant risk of causing widespread illness across multiple countries or continents.\nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution.\nresolution_date: 2030-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "Pandemic potential" is way too subjective; it is not a clearly objective threshold. \nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution." is not good because it is not clear on what exactly they should agree on.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 7:\ntitle: Will DeepMind develop an AI with the capability to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, DeepMind has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that has been publicly recognized to significantly disrupt at least one major industry.  The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030.

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"},"Q":{"title":"Conditional on US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falling below 75 years before 2040, will there not be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?","body":"Resolution Criteria for P:\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively only if both of the following conditions are met:

(a) There will be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100: This condition will be satisfied if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalized relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.

(b) US life expectancy at birth for both sexes will not fall below 75 years before 2040: This condition will be satisfied if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is 75 years or more, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People\'s Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occur:\\nThere are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People\'s Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\\nThere are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People\'s Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\\nThese 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.\\nThis question will resolves as No otherwise.\\nIn the context of this question, an armed conflict will be defined as a dispute that concerns a government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in an exchange of weapon fire or detonations\\n"},"Q":{"title":"Will there be at least one open stock exchange in the US during every year before 2120?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if there is no period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\\nFine Print\\nWe\'ll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place."}}'}]

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:
(a) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880. Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.
(b) Neither of the following occur:
(i) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.
(ii) There is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true: - Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory. - Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory. These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be. As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this part will resolve as Yes. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this part will be Annulled. Note: extraterrestrial life must be (i) living currently and (ii) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.
(b) Prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050. If this has not happened before January 1, 2050, this part will resolve as Yes.

You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will US life expectancy at birth for both sexes fall below 75 years before 2040?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print for P:
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if not all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is invoked.
While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are fewer than 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
Not all of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print for Q:
Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

Suppose the following is true: There is a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120. Then is the USA not entering a second civil war before 2031?

question.body: Resolution Criteria:

1. Before January 1, 2025, at least two of the following public health agencies must claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. The relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.

- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)
- The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)
- World Health Organization
- The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
- The Centre for Health Protection
- Robert Koch Institute
- The National Institute of Infectious Diseases
- Public Health England
- The National Centre for Infectious Diseases
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Korea
- The Public Health Agency of Canada

In case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.

2. If US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before January 1, 2040, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations, then there must not be a global thermonuclear war by January 1, 2070. This means there must not be an armed conflict where either of the following conditions are true:

- Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
- Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.

These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.

Predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

In particular:\n   - In case of events that happen at a fixed time (e.g. "Will France win the FIFA World Cup in 2026"), it should *never* be *before* the date when the event is scheduled to happen. Ideally it is exactly at the date. There can be *at most a month of leeway* to account for resolution issues and delays. If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if either of the following occurs: (1) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve this part of the question.
(2) By January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880, according to NASA or other relevant datasets.

In particular:\n   - In case of events that happen at a fixed time (e.g. "Will France win the FIFA World Cup in 2026"), it should *never* be *before* the date when the event is scheduled to happen. Ideally it is exactly at the date. There can be *at most a month of leeway* to account for resolution issues and delays. If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it. In this case, the `body` should say the question resolves N/A if the resolution date comes and there was no resolution.\n\n- The resolution criteria should not be excessively vague or ambiguous, and should be consistent with the question.\n\nThe format of your response should be:\nreasoning: [reasoning here]\nvalid: [True/False]\n\nExample 1:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2020?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected as the president of the United States before January 1, 2020.\nresolution_date: 2020-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body (resolution criteria) is clear and consistent with the title.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 2:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if it happens.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body is too vague.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 3:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States before January 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2030.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution criteria are clear and consistent with the title.\nThe resolution date is consistent with the title and in the future.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 4:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2031.\nresolution_date: 2031-12-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is too late compared to when the body says the question will resolve.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

question.body: Suppose the following is true: Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045, and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. Extraterrestrial life must be (a) living currently and (b) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.

messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.I will give you two forecasting questions with Yes/No answers. You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Conditional on US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falling below 75 years before 2040, will there be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?","body":"Resolution Criteria for P:\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.\\n\\nResolution Criteria for Q:\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if there is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:\\nThree countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory\\nTwo countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.\\nThese conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.\\nAs with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.\\n\\nSuppose the following is true: US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before 2040. Then is it true that there will be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?"},"Q":{"title":"Before 2025, will at least two public health agencies claim that China deliberately misreported COVID-19 infections?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in China has been rife with allegations of misrepresentation by Chinese government officials. These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}}'}]

This question will resolve as Yes if humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extra terrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this question will resolve as No. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this question will be Annulled.
Note: extraterrestrial life must be (a) living currently and (b) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur: 
(a) At any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occur:
There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.
In the context of this question, an armed conflict will be defined as a dispute that concerns a government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in an exchange of weapon fire or detonations
(b) There is no period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

This question will resolve as No otherwise.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

You should then give me the conditional expression of these two questions, i.e. \'GIVEN P is true, then is Q true?\' P is the condition, Q is the outcome we are interested in. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible. If writing the whole thing in a single sentence becomes too long and cumbersome, you can write something like: Suppose the following is true: P. Then is Q true?\n - If the question allows for a simple rephrasing or factorization, go for it.\n - If Q is already a conditional expression, you can just combine the conditions. I.e. (Given P then (Given P2 then Q)) can just be written as (Given P AND P2 then Q). Again if P and P2 is too long and cumbersome, you might want to write something like: Suppose the following is true: P. Then is Q true? And as always if a more natural formulation exists, always go for it.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain all relevant information in the question bodies. of BOTH base questions. You cannot leave out a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The conditional question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your conditional expression; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is more-or-less self-sufficient independent of the body. It\'s OK if some detailed criteria/nuances/background info/ambiguity resolution are only in the body, but the title should be basically a well-formed question on its own.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for Global Warming:
This question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 ˚C greater than the average global temperature in 1880.
(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)
Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway.
The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data

Resolution Criteria for Civil War:
This question will resolve as Yes if not all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is invoked.
While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are fewer than 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
Not all of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print for Civil War:
Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

Conditional Clause:
This question is conditional on there being a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120. This condition will be satisfied if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) Before January 1, 2025, credible reports indicate that North Korea has suffered from a famine beginning no earlier than January 1, 2020 that has likely resulted in at least 250,000 deaths.
(b) Neither of the following conditions occur:

2. Before January 1, 2031, all of the following conditions are met:
- The Insurrection Act is invoked.
- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.

Data for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible. Note that the data in the link is normalised relative to the 1951-1980 baseline, on which 1880 stands at -0.2. Therefore, the critical value to look for with this specific NASA dataset will be 1.8 ˚C. It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.\n(b) Neither of the following occur:\n(i) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.I will give you two forecasting questions with Yes/No answers. You should then give me the logical OR of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if EITHER question is answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen or will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking which of the two will happen (whereas you\'re actually seeking a YES/NO answer on whether either of the two will happen). Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will either of the following occur: (a) P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 OR P2) OR Q) how you would combine (P1 OR P2 OR Q)\n    - ((P1 AND P2) OR Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will EITHER of the following occur: (1) BOTH of the following occur: (a) P1 AND (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) OR (Given B then Q) should be combined as is, rather than messing up the conditions. E.g. a phrasing like \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions: (a) Given A then P? (b) Given B then Q?\' is good.\n - This also applies when only one of the questions is conditional. Like \'P OR (Given A then Q)\'should be phrased as something like: \'Will either of the following occur given their respective conditions are met? (a) P (b) Given A, then Q?\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Conditional on there being a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120, will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?","body":"Resolution Criteria for P:\\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\\nFine Print for P:\\nWe\'ll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\\n\\nResolution Criteria for Q:\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\\nThe Insurrection Act is invoked.\\nWhile the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\\nAll of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\\nFine Print for Q:\\nAny conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if either of the following occurs:
1. There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
2. At any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occurs:
   - There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
   - There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.
This question will resolve as No otherwise.

This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(a) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.
(b) There is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
- Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
- Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
1. Any exoplanet with >5% O2 atmosphere is found before January 1, 2030.
2. At least one of the following does not occur:
(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this part will resolve as Yes. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this part will be Annulled. Note: extraterrestrial life must be (i) living currently and (ii) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.
(b) Prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050. If this has not happened before January 1, 2050, this part will resolve as Yes.

In particular:\n   - In case of events that happen at a fixed time (e.g. "Will France win the FIFA World Cup in 2026"), it should *never* be *before* the date when the event is scheduled to happen. Ideally it is exactly at the date. There can be *at most a month of leeway* to account for resolution issues and delays. If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018.

messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.I will give you two forecasting questions with Yes/No answers. You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will Europa be the first place humanity will discover extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extra terrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

messages: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.I will give you two forecasting questions with Yes/No answers. You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Conditional on Europa being the first place humanity discovers extraterrestrial life before 2045, will we find life on Mars by 2050?","body":"Suppose the following is true: Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045, and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if there is an armed conflict before January 1, 2070 where either of the following conditions are true:
Three countries each detonate at least 10 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory
Two countries each detonate at least 50 nuclear devices of at least 10 kiloton yield outside of their own territory.
These conditions are chosen to set aside a two-party regional nuclear war, say between India and Pakistan, or Israel and an adversary, or the UK and France, as disastrous as that would be.
As with many questions with a positive-resolution condition that may preclude being awarded points on Metaculus, predictors are enjoined to predict in good faith, as points will not be awarded until 2070 anyway.

Suppose the following is true: US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before 2040. Then is it true that there will be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?

It is likely, though, that the link will no longer be active in a few decades, so a different dataset may have to be used anyway. The last possible set of 5 years to satisfy the requirement would be 2095-2099, so the last possible resolution date would be around mid-2100, in order to make sure that there are no uncertainties regarding the 2099 climate data.

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. For the purpose of this question, we consider only statements by the following public health agencies:\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)\\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)\\nWorld Health Organization\\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\\nThe Centre for Health Protection\\nRobert Koch Institute\\nThe National Institute of Infectious Diseases\\nPublic Health England\\nThe National Centre for Infectious Diseases\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Korea\\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\\nIn case multiple subdivisions of any of the above agencies make assessments that China more likely than not lied about case or death numbers, these will only count as single accusation made by a single agency.\\nThe relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.\\nThis question has a short-fuse sister.\\n"}}'}]

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
(b) All of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
- The Insurrection Act is invoked.
- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print
For condition (a), we'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.
For condition (b), any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

This question will resolve as Yes if any of the following occurs:
(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this part will resolve as No. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this part will be Annulled. Note: extraterrestrial life must be (i) living currently and (ii) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.
(b) Prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050. If this has not happened before January 1, 2050, this part will resolve as No.
(c) Any exoplanet with >5% O2 atmosphere is found before January 1, 2030.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print for P:
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is invoked.
While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print for Q:
Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

Suppose the following is true: There is a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120. Then is the USA entering a second civil war before 2031?

question.body: Resolution Criteria for Condition P:
This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations. An official statement by any one of those organizations is sufficient to resolve the question.

Resolution Criteria for Outcome Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers. If an agency claims that the numbers were flawed, but does not go as far as to suggest deliberate lying or misrepresentation, this will not count. The relevant assessments will count if they are judged by Metaculus to broadly state that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately did lie about, fabricate, or misrepresent case or death counts.
The agencies considered are:
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (including the Epidemic Intelligence Service)
- The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (including the Health Threat Unit)
- World Health Organization
- The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
- The Centre for Health Protection
- Robert Koch Institute
- The National Institute of Infectious Diseases
- Public Health England
- The National Centre for Infectious Diseases
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Korea
- The Public Health Agency of Canada

Suppose the following is true: US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falls below 75 years before 2040. Then is it true that at least two public health agencies will claim that China deliberately misreported COVID-19 infections before 2025?

question.body: Resolution Criteria for Condition: This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.

Resolution Criteria for Outcome: This question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occur:
1. There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
2. There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.
These 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.
This question will resolve as No otherwise.
In the context of this question, an armed conflict will be defined as a dispute that concerns a government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in an exchange of weapon fire or detonations.

You should then give me the conditional expression of these two questions, i.e. \'GIVEN P is true, then is Q true?\' P is the condition, Q is the outcome we are interested in. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible. If writing the whole thing in a single sentence becomes too long and cumbersome, you can write something like: Suppose the following is true: P. Then is Q true?\n - If the question allows for a simple rephrasing or factorization, go for it.\n - If Q is already a conditional expression, you can just combine the conditions. I.e. (Given P then (Given P2 then Q)) can just be written as (Given P AND P2 then Q). Again if P and P2 is too long and cumbersome, you might want to write something like: Suppose the following is true: P. Then is Q true? And as always if a more natural formulation exists, always go for it.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain all relevant information in the question bodies. of BOTH base questions. You cannot leave out a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The conditional question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your conditional expression; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n- Also, make sure that the title is more-or-less self-sufficient independent of the body. It\'s OK if some detailed criteria/nuances/background info/ambiguity resolution are only in the body, but the title should be basically a well-formed question on its own.\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Conditional on there being a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120, will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?","body":"Resolution Criteria for P:\\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\\nFine Print for P:\\nWe\'ll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\\n\\nResolution Criteria for Q:\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\\nThe Insurrection Act is invoked.\\nWhile the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\\nAll of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\\nFine Print for Q:\\nAny conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:
(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe. If extraterrestrial life is found convincingly elsewhere prior to on Europa, this part will resolve as No. If no extraterrestrial life is found before 2045, this part will be Annulled. Note: extraterrestrial life must be (i) living currently and (ii) highly unlikely to be a result of contamination by Earth spacecraft. This leaves open the possibility of life transported from Earth via other non-human-engineered means.
(b) Prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050. If this has not happened before January 1, 2050, this part will resolve as No.

These began at the local level, where officials in Hubei province potentially under-reported the magnitude of the outbreak in early January to Chinese central government authorities. A public health worker famously released a video around January 26 claiming that at that time, at least 90,000 cases had occurred--at the time the Chinese government was reporting fewer than 2000 infections. Since then, the insufficiently-inclusive strategy of counting only persons with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 depressed the counts of probable cases. And the patterns of growth in the official counts follow an unexpected distribution, implying the counts may be generated by a model which doesn\'t accurately represent the dynamics of the disease\'s spread through the population.\\nThis latter allegation is perhaps the most important and severe, as it means that estimations of epidemiological characteristics based on Chinese data may lead to public health interventions which do not reflect the reality of the viral spread. For example, if the R_0 (the average number of people an infected person will pass the virus along to) is underestimated, it may lead to insufficiently aggressive strategies for reducing the propagation of the virus across the globe. However, overestimating it could lead to overly-aggressive quarantining strategies, hobbling international commerce. Getting a proper assessment of the epidemiological dynamics is critical to devising the appropriate public health response.\\nWill at least two public health agencies publicly accuse the Chinese government of deliberately misrepresenting the number of COVID-19 infections before 2025?\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, at least two of the public health agencies listed below claim that it is more likely than not that the Chinese government deliberately lied about, fabricated, or misrepresented case or death numbers.

question.body: Resolution Criteria
This question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
(b) All of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
- The Insurrection Act is invoked.
- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).

If these conditions are true, the question then becomes: Will there be a major famine in North Korea before 2025? This question will resolve as Yes if credible reports indicate that North Korea has suffered from a famine beginning no earlier than January 1, 2020 that has likely resulted in at least 250,000 deaths before January 1, 2025. The question will resolve as No if this does not occur.

If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it.

The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity.

This question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:
(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading. For this condition, we'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive): The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.
(b) Before January 1, 2025, credible reports indicate that North Korea has suffered from a famine beginning no earlier than January 1, 2020 that has likely resulted in at least 250,000 deaths. The question will resolve as No if this does not occur.

Ideally it is exactly at the date. There can be *at most a month of leeway* to account for resolution issues and delays. If the delay is too long, the question should be marked invalid.\n   - In case of events that could resolve at an uncertain date (will Warren Buffet die of cancer?), the resolution date should be such that it is highly likely the event will happen before it. In this case, the `body` should say the question resolves N/A if the resolution date comes and there was no resolution.\n\n- The resolution criteria should not be excessively vague or ambiguous, and should be consistent with the question.\n\nThe format of your response should be:\nreasoning: [reasoning here]\nvalid: [True/False]\n\nExample 1:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2020?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected as the president of the United States before January 1, 2020.\nresolution_date: 2020-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body (resolution criteria) is clear and consistent with the title.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 2:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if it happens.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The body is too vague.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 3:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States before January 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2030.\nresolution_date: 2030-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution criteria are clear and consistent with the title.\nThe resolution date is consistent with the title and in the future.\nvalid: True\n\n\nExample 4:\ntitle: Will Kanye West become the president of the United States by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West is elected and inaugurated as the president of the United States before January 1, 2031.\nresolution_date: 2031-12-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is too late compared to when the body says the question will resolve. It is in December 2031, while the body says the question should resolve by January 2031.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 5:\ntitle: Will any member of Kanye West\'s family become the president of the United States by 2035?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if Kanye West or any of his family members (including his wife, children, siblings and parents) is elected and... Show More\n\nresolution_date: 2035-01-01 00:00:00\n\n->\n\nreasoning: There is a "Show More" instead of the end of the resolution criteria.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 6:\ntitle: Will a new strain of influenza virus with pandemic potential be identified by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, a new strain of influenza virus is identified that meets the following criteria: \n- The strain must be genetically distinct from previously identified strains, with genetic differences significant enough to be considered a new strain by the World Health Organization (WHO) or a similar authoritative body.\n- The strain must have demonstrated the ability to cause human infection and have the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.\n- The strain must be assessed by the WHO or a similar authoritative body as having pandemic potential, meaning it has a significant risk of causing widespread illness across multiple countries or continents.\nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution.\nresolution_date: 2030-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "Pandemic potential" is way too subjective; it is not a clearly objective threshold. \nIn the absence of a formal declaration by the WHO or a similar authoritative body, a consensus among at least three leading infectious disease research institutions will be considered sufficient for resolution." is not good because it is not clear on what exactly they should agree on.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 7:\ntitle: Will DeepMind develop an AI with the capability to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030?\nbody: This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2030, DeepMind has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that has been publicly recognized to significantly disrupt at least one major industry.  The AI system must be a primary factor in the disruption, as opposed to a contributing technology among others. The industry in question must be one of the following: healthcare, automotive, finance, entertainment, or energy. Disruption is considered significant if it leads to a change in at least 20%% of the market share within the industry or a comparable metric of impact, such as a 20%% increase in efficiency or productivity. The resolution will rely on reports and analyses from the specified industry sources published by December 31, 2030. In the absence of clear industry consensus, a panel of experts from the affected industry may be consulted to determine the resolution.\n\n->\n\nreasoning: "to significantly disrupt at least one major industry by 2030" is too fuzzy. The resolution criteria must be quantifiable. "20%% increase in efficiency or productivity" is clearly not measurable.\nIn addition, we do not want multiple distinct pathways to resolution in a question where it is not important there are multiple pathways.\nHere, we have both the market share and "a comparable metric of impact" as resolution criteria, and notwithstanding the fact that impact is not defined clearly, we should not have both.\nvalid: False\n\n\nExample 8:\ntitle: Will France win any major football tournament by 2026?\nbody: France has last won the FIFA World Cup in 2018. This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2026, the French national football team (senior, not youth or women\'s) has won either the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA European Championship.\nresolution_date: 2026-12-31 23:59:59\n\n->\n\nreasoning: The resolution date is fine. The body is clear; there are multiple distinct pathways to resolution, but all are important for the question. The body includes a bit of background information that is not necessary for the question, but it is not harmful.\nvalid: True\n-----\n\ntitle: Given that both (a) humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before 2045 and (b) we find life on Mars by 2050, will we detect an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% oxygen before 2030?\nbody: Suppose the following is true: (a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045, and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe, and (b) prominent scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars before January 1, 2050. \n\nResolution criteria: This question will resolve as Yes if any exoplanet with >5% O2 atmosphere is found before January 1, 2030.\nresolution_date: 2050-12-31 00:00:00+00:00\n'}]

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Conditional on there being a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120, will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?","body":"Resolution Criteria for P:\\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\\nFine Print for P:\\nWe\'ll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\\n\\nResolution Criteria for Q:\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\\nThe Insurrection Act is invoked.\\nWhile the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\\nAll of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\\nFine Print for Q:\\nAny conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

You should then give me the logical AND of these two questions, i.e. the question that would be answered YES if BOTH questions are answered YES, and NO otherwise. Notes:\n\n - Your response should be as clear as possible, since the words \'and\' and \'or\' are used ambiguously in natural language. For example, \'Will P happen and will Q happen? is usually confusing, as it sounds like you are asking two questions. Instead, if there is any chance of confusion, you should give me something like: Will both of the following occur: (a) and P (b) Q?\n\n - When the questions allow for a simple rephrasing or factorization (e.g. using words like \'respectively\', \'both\' or \'either\'), go for it.\n - If one or both of the given questions is already a logical combination of questions, join them in the most natural way possible. E.g. \n    - combine ((P1 AND P2) AND Q) how you would combine (P1 AND P2 AND Q)\n    - ((P1 OR P2) AND Q) might have to be combined as something like: Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) EITHER of the following occurs: (a) P1 OR (b) P2 (2) Q. Unless a more natural formulation exists.\n - Be careful when combining conditional expressions (which often have words like \'given\' and \'if\'). \'(Given A then P) AND (Given B then Q) should be combined as \'Given (A AND B) then (P AND Q)\'. \n - When only one of the questions is conditional, the combined question should be conditional. i.e. \'(Given A then P) AND Q\' should be combined as \'Given A then (P AND Q)\'.\n - Most importantly: make sure you retain ALL the information in the question bodies from BOTH base questions! You cannot discard a single relevant detail. All this is for an experiment to test the logical consistency of forecasters: The combined question you give will be handed to the forecasters without having seen the base questions, so it is critical that all the information in the base questions be included in your logical combination; the resolution criterion for each component should be neatly and clearly provided.\n - Also, make sure that the title is self-sufficient independent of the body, i.e. is a question that can be meaningfully answered without looking at the body. So you CANNOT give me a question title like \'Is the following true?\' or \'What will happen if the following happens?\'\n - One type of question you may be given is a single choice from a multiple choice question. For example, you may be given \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (Japan)\'. This is asking if Japan will recognize and legalize human cloning by 2030. Such a question may also itself be a logical combination -- e.g. \'Which of these countries will legalize human cloning by 2030? (UK, France, or Germany) is asking if any either of the UK, France, or Germany will legalize human cloning by 2030. Make sure to correctly combine such combinations as previously described.\n\n{"P":{"title":"Will both of the following occur: (a) Europa will be the first place humanity will discover extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045, and (b) we will find life on Mars by 2050?","body":"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:\\n(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

question.body: Resolution Criteria for P:
This question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.
Fine Print for P:
We'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

Resolution Criteria for Q:
This question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:
The Insurrection Act is invoked.
While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.
All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).
Fine Print for Q:
Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question. Conflicts between the US military and US residents, possibly supported by other nations with weapons or resources, will be included.
Conflicts between civilians and local police will not be included, unless there are active armed forces in the region providing mutual support.
Deaths are calculated among all of the states (and Washington, DC) in the United States. New states which are admitted shall be included, states which secede or are removed, will not be included. Suicides do not count towards the death count.

Given that there is a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120, will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031, and will there be at least 2˚C of global warming by 2100?
