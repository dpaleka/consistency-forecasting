    So it's easy to explain for a single consistency check--

    given forecasts F(P1), F(P2) ... F(Pn) (e.g. P1 = P, P2 = Â¬P), our arbitrage metric (Checker.max_min_arbitrage() in the code) computes two things:

    Improved forecasts F'(P1), F'(P2) ... F'(P_n) which are consistent
    The profit earned by an arbitrageur who bets these improved forecasts
    So say you have a forecaster F: P -> F(P)

    Then define a new forecaster F' which, given P:

    instantiates P2, ... Pn with Checker.instantiate()
    Queries F(P1), F(P2) ... F(Pn) from F.
    uses Checker.max_min_arbitrage() to calculate F'(P1), F'(P2) ... F'(Pn).

    This F' is now perfectly consistent under Checker.
    Of course:

    1) This isn't necessarily robust to different instantiations. You might be able to instantiate P2 ... Pn slightly differently and F' would be inconsistent under that

    2) This is only for a single Checker. E.g. you could make an F' that is consistent under NegChecker and it won't magically become consistent under any other checkers.

    For multiple checkers, we just sequentially arbitrage on each checker.
