The ban targets six categories of single-use plastics: checkout bags, cutlery, foodservice ware made from or containing problematic plastics, ring carriers, stir sticks, and straws.\n\n    2. **Current Status**: The ban on the manufacture and import of these items began on December 20, 2022, with the sale of these items prohibited starting December 20, 2023. The export of these items is slated to be banned by December 20, 2025.\n\n    3. **Legal Challenges**: There was a legal challenge to the ban, with the Federal Court ruling in favor of the industry, stating that the broad definition of \"toxic\" plastics was unreasonable and unconstitutional. However, the Federal Court of Appeal granted a stay, allowing the ban to remain in effect while the government's appeal is ongoing.\n\n    4. **Recent Developments**: As of the latest updates in April 2024, the ban remains in place due to the stay granted by the Federal Court of Appeal. This means that the single-use plastics ban is currently enforced and has not been officially reversed.\n\n    Given this information, it is clear that as of the current date (June 30, 2024), Canada's ban on single-use plastics remains in effect. Since there is no indication of an immediate reversal before August 2024, and considering the legal process is ongoing, we can conclude that the ban will likely continue through August 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":true}},"resolution":true}}}}

Landry*, but the lawsuit was dismissed, and the ban remains in effect.\n\n    3. **Recent Developments**: There have been no recent reports or court rulings declaring the ban constitutional by the specified date. In fact, a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at reinstating abortion access in Louisiana was rejected by the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure in March 2024, indicating no change in the legal status of the ban.\n\n    4. **News Coverage**: No reputable national news sources have reported a court ruling confirming the constitutionality of the ban by August 31, 2024.\n\n    Given the current information, there is no evidence to suggest that Louisiana's near-total abortion ban has been declared constitutional by a court ruling reported by at least two reputable national news sources by August 31, 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

This means that a referendum on abortion rights cannot be initiated by citizens but must go through the legislative process.\n    2. **Current Abortion Laws in Texas**: Texas has a near-total ban on abortion, with recent legislation making performing an abortion a felony. This indicates a strong stance against abortion rights by the current legislative body.\n    3. **Absence of Referendum Plans**: There is no information or announcement from the Texas state government about conducting a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. In fact, the focus has been on local initiatives and legal challenges rather than a statewide referendum.\n    4. **Local Initiatives**: While there are local initiatives and discussions about abortion rights, such as the proposed abortion travel ban in Amarillo, these do not constitute a statewide referendum on enshrining protection for abortion rights.\n    \n    Given these points, it is clear that Texas will not hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024.

This discrepancy suggests the question might not be well-formed or accurate regarding the specific case.\n    2. **Additional Charges**: Despite the potential mismatch in the case type, we can still examine if a Steven Parker faced additional charges. According to the sources, Steven Parker in Volusia County was indeed charged with additional criminal counts related to contractor fraud and exploitation of an elderly veteran. These charges were reported in March 2024, which is before the resolution date of July 31, 2024.\n    3. **Relevance and Specificity**: The question's details specify that the new charges must be distinct from and in addition to the original counts. The sources confirm that Parker faced new charges for exploiting a 97-year-old veteran and for contractor fraud in additional cases, which are distinct from the initial charges.\n    4. **Conclusion**: Given the information available, it appears that a Steven Parker did face additional criminal charges by July 2024. However, due to the potential mismatch in the case type (procurement fraud vs. contractor fraud), there is a slight ambiguity. Despite this, the core of the question regarding additional charges seems to be resolved affirmatively based on the available data.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":true}},"resolution":true}}}}

However, we can look at related statistics to understand the trend.\n\n    Source from Statista provides the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the UK for the first and second quarters of 2024. It mentions that approximately 1.57 million people claimed unemployment benefits in the first quarter, and 1.63 million in the second quarter. These numbers are significantly higher than 100,000 and do not indicate a drop below 100,000 for any month.\n\n    Source from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) provides more detailed information on labor market statistics, including the Claimant Count. According to this source, the UK Claimant Count for July 2024 increased on the month and on the year, to 1.801 million. This suggests that the number of jobless claims is not decreasing but rather increasing, making it unlikely that the average weekly jobless claims would fall below 100,000 for any month by August 2024.\n\n    Given the available data and the trend it indicates, it is reasonable to conclude that the average weekly jobless claims did not fall below 100,000 for any month by August 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

However, the search results indicate a Steven Parker in Volusia County, Florida, who was involved in contractor fraud, not procurement fraud. This discrepancy suggests the question might not be well-formed or accurate regarding the specific case.\n    2. **Additional Charges**: Despite the potential mismatch in the case type, we can still examine if a Steven Parker faced additional charges. According to the sources, Steven Parker in Volusia County was indeed charged with additional criminal counts related to contractor fraud and exploitation of an elderly veteran. These charges were reported in March 2024, which is before the resolution date of July 31, 2024.\n    3. **Relevance and Specificity**: The question's details specify that the new charges must be distinct from and in addition to the original counts. The sources confirm that Parker faced new charges for exploiting a 97-year-old veteran and for contractor fraud in additional cases, which are distinct from the initial charges.\n    4. **Conclusion**: Given the information available, it appears that a Steven Parker did face additional criminal charges by July 2024. However, due to the potential mismatch in the case type (procurement fraud vs. contractor fraud), there is a slight ambiguity. Despite this, the core of the question regarding additional charges seems to be resolved affirmatively based on the available data.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":true}},"resolution":true}}}}

Official statements and announcements from the White House and reputable news outlets.\n\n    The sources indicate that President Biden had planned to speak at the National Education Association (NEA) convention in Philadelphia but canceled his speech due to a strike by the NEA staff union. The strike led to the cancellation of the last three days of the convention, including the day President Biden was scheduled to speak.\n\n    Given this information, it is clear that President Biden did not deliver a speech at the NEA event as planned due to the strike. Since the question pertains to a speech at a \"National Teachers Association\" event and the closest relevant information is about the NEA, it can be inferred that the question is likely referring to the NEA event. However, it's crucial to note that the exact organization name in the question (\"National Teachers Association\") does not match the one found in the sources (\"National Education Association\").\n\n    Despite this discrepancy, considering the context and the information available, it is reasonable to conclude that the question is referring to the NEA event.

According to the Maryland Department of Health's announcement on July 11, 2024, the Medicaid enrollment stood at 1,684,462 as of May 31, 2024, which is after the pandemic-related automatic enrollments were re-evaluated.\n    2. **Pre-Pandemic Enrollment**: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the enrollment was 1,415,631.

Given the recent activities and announcements from both countries, we can analyze the following points: 1. **Defense Cooperation**: There have been significant developments in defense cooperation between France and Saudi Arabia. For instance, the Commander of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) Admiral Fahd Al-Ghufaili visited Paris and met with the Chief of Staff of the French Navy Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, discussing various defense projects and technologies, including submarines. Additionally, Saudi Arabia and France signed an executive plan for cooperation on capabilities, military industries, and R&D, indicating a deepening of their defense ties. 2. **Economic and Energy Cooperation**: France has been engaging in talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to diversify Europe's energy supplies, aiming to reduce dependence on Russian energy sources. This indicates a new area of cooperation focused on energy security. 3. **Industrial and Technological Collaboration**: The participation of Saudi Arabia in the Eurosatory 2024 defense exhibition in Paris, where the Saudi pavilion showcased the kingdom's military industries and invited global investors, highlights efforts to enhance industrial and technological collaboration between the two countries. Given these developments, it is clear that France and Saudi Arabia have indeed implemented new forms of cooperation, particularly in defense and energy sectors, by July 2024.

The strike led to the cancellation of the last three days of the convention, including the day President Biden was scheduled to speak.\n\n    Given this information, it is clear that President Biden did not deliver a speech at the NEA event as planned due to the strike. Since the question pertains to a speech at a \"National Teachers Association\" event and the closest relevant information is about the NEA, it can be inferred that the question is likely referring to the NEA event. However, it's crucial to note that the exact organization name in the question (\"National Teachers Association\") does not match the one found in the sources (\"National Education Association\").\n\n    Despite this discrepancy, considering the context and the information available, it is reasonable to conclude that the question is referring to the NEA event.

To answer this, we need to look at recent developments regarding net neutrality regulations.\n\n    According to the FCC's official announcements and other reliable sources:\n    1. **The FCC adopted a Declaratory Ruling, Order, Report and Order, and Order on Reconsideration on April 25, 2024, restoring Net Neutrality and bringing back a national standard for broadband reliability, security, and consumer protection.**\n    2. **The final rule was published in the Federal Register on May 22, 2024, establishing an effective date of July 22, 2024.**\n    3. **However, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order to temporarily stay the FCC's net neutrality final rule from going into effect on July 22, 2024. The stay was in place through August 5, 2024.**\n\n    Given these points, the FCC did attempt to reinstate net neutrality rules, but the implementation was temporarily stayed by the court.

The court granted petitioners' motion to stay pending review, indicating that the petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to the Order. This means the rule's reinstatement is still pending legal review and not effectively reinstated as of the resolution date.\n\n    Therefore, despite the FCC's efforts to reinstate net neutrality, the legal challenges and the court's stay mean the rule was not effectively reinstated by August 31, 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

This plea was made on July 22, 2024, which is within the timeframe of our question.\n\n    2. **Nature of Charges**: The charges to which Dean pleaded no contest were related to cruelty to the infirmed, Medicaid fraud, and obstruction of justice, all stemming from the evacuation of his nursing homes during Hurricane Ida. These charges are indeed connected to incidents where nursing home residents were endangered during a flood (Hurricane Ida).\n\n    3. **New Charges**: However, the question specifically asks for new charges distinct from those to which Dean has already pleaded no contest. The provided sources do not mention any new charges being filed against Bob Dean Jr. by July 31, 2024, that are separate from the ones he pleaded no contest to.\n\n    4. **Conclusion**: Since there is no information about new charges being filed against Bob Dean Jr. related to flood incidents by July 31, 2024, that are distinct from the charges he has already pleaded no contest to, we can resolve this question.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

Specifically:\n    - The official website and social media accounts of Telus do not contain any such announcement.\n    - None of the specified major news outlets (Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, NYT) have reported on this topic.\n    - No other reputable sources have covered this announcement.\n\n    The question clearly states that if no such confirmation is made by July 31, 2024, the question will resolve as NO. Given that we have reached this date and no announcement has been made through the specified channels, we can confidently resolve this question.\n\n    Additionally, checking recent cyberattacks and data breaches involving Telus, there is no mention of a payment to a hacker to erase sensitive data by July 2024.\n\n    Therefore, based on the available information, the question can be resolved as NO.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

However, this figure includes both existing and new enrollments, not specifically those enrolled under the expansion program.\n\n    2. **Medicaid Expansion Program**: The Apple Health Expansion program, which is part of Washington's Medicaid expansion, specifically targets undocumented immigrants.

The focus has been on the overall trade balance, sectoral data, and specific product exports rather than on the elimination of export taxes.\n\n    Given the lack of information on the elimination of export taxes specifically by July 31, 2024, and considering that the sources do not mention any such policy change, it appears that the question cannot be resolved affirmatively. However, since the question's resolution criteria are clear and no such policy has been announced or implemented as per the available data, we can infer a negative resolution.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

The key sources to consider are those that discuss the Senate's appropriations bills and their impact on the EPA's funding. 1. **E&E News by POLITICO** (Source 3) provides crucial information about the final fiscal 2024 spending bills released by House and Senate appropriators. According to this source, the legislation would give the EPA close to $9.2 billion for fiscal 2024, which is a marked drop from the agency's current funding of roughly $10.1 billion. However, this reduction is approximately 9%, which is less than the 20% cut specified in the question. 2. **House Passes Funding Bill that would Cut EPA Budget by 40%** (Source 5) discusses the House's approval of a fiscal year 2024 appropriations bill that would fund the EPA at $6.17 billion, a nearly 40% cut. However, this source pertains to the House's actions, not the Senate's. 3. **FY 2025 Budget | US EPA** (Source 4) outlines the President's proposed budget for the EPA in fiscal year 2025, which is not directly relevant to the question about fiscal year 2024. Given the information from E&E News by POLITICO, the Senate's proposed funding for the EPA in fiscal year 2024 does not include a reduction of more than 20%.

This incident does not meet the criteria specified in the question as it is not linked to an attack by a regional militant group.\n    - **Source** also mentions the same alleged oil spill, but again, it does not fit the criteria of being caused by a militant attack.\n    - **Source** discusses environmental damage in the Caspian Sea due to military activities, specifically mentioning the impact of missile launches and military exercises on marine life.

To resolve this, we need to look at the available information up to July 2024.\n\n    1. **EPA Grant for Climate Goals**: Oregon received almost $200 million from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for various climate-related projects, including electric vehicle incentives and infrastructure. This grant is part of the EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program but does not specifically mention electric vehicle manufacturing or assembly projects.\n\n    2. **NEVI Program Funding**: Oregon received $52 million through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program to expand public fast-charging electric vehicle stations across the state. This funding is specifically for EV charging infrastructure, not manufacturing or assembly.\n\n    3. **Additional Grants**: Other grants mentioned include $15 million for the city of Tualatin and surrounding areas to install EV charging stations, and nearly $1.9 million for the city of Albany to build EV charging stations at various locations. These are also for EV charging infrastructure.\n\n    4. **West Coast Truck Charging and Fueling Corridor Project**: Oregon is part of a collaborative project with California and Washington to deploy charging and hydrogen fueling stations for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, with California receiving $102 million for this project. However, the specific amount allocated to Oregon for this project is not detailed in the provided sources.\n\n    Adding up the grants specifically for electric vehicle-related projects in Oregon that are mentioned:\n    - $200 million (EPA grant for broader climate goals, including EV incentives)\n    - $52 million (NEVI program for fast-charging stations)\n    - $15 million (Tualatin and surrounding areas for EV charging)\n    - $1.9 million (Albany for EV charging stations)\n\n    The total from these sources is $268.9 million. However, not all of these funds are explicitly for electric vehicle manufacturing or assembly projects, as required by the question. The EPA grant, while significant, is for broader climate goals and includes but is not limited to EV initiatives.\n\n    Given the information available and the specific criteria of the question, it appears that Oregon did not receive over $300 million in federal grants specifically for electric vehicle manufacturing, assembly, or related projects by July 2024. However, the lack of clarity on the allocation of funds within the broader grants and the specific focus on manufacturing or assembly projects makes a definitive answer challenging.\n\n    Considering the strict criteria and the need for explicit designation for electric vehicle-related initiatives within Oregon, the question leans towards a resolution of NO based on the available data. However, given the complexity and the potential for additional grants not covered in the provided sources, caution is warranted.\n\n    Therefore, while the evidence suggests a NO, the question's specificity and the potential for unreported grants up to July 2024 introduce uncertainty. However, based on the information provided and adhering strictly to the question's criteria, the most accurate response given the data would be NO, but with an acknowledgment of the limitations in the available information.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

Major reputable news outlets including ABC News, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Australian.\n\n    The Australian government has proposed changes to the indexation amounts that apply to Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) student loans from 2023 onwards. Specifically, the government has decided to calculate the annual indexation based on the lesser of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wage Price Index (WPI), instead of solely on CPI. This change aims to prevent student debts from growing faster than wages.\n\n    Education Minister Jason Clare announced that this change would \"wipe out what happened last year and make sure it never happens again,\" referring to the high 7.1% indexation increase in 2023, which will be retroactively reduced to 3.2%.\n\n    This policy change directly impacts the amount of debt owed by students and, by extension, can lower the monthly payments required to repay these loans. The implementation of this plan has been confirmed by official announcements and reported by major news outlets, such as ABC News.\n\n    Given this information, it is clear that the Australian government has implemented a plan to lower student loan payments by changing the indexation method, which aligns with the criteria for resolving this question positively.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":true}},"resolution":true}}}}
