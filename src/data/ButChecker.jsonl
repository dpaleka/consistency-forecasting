The real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States, as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) or its successor agency, increases by more than 3% in total between the fourth quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2030, adjusted for inflation and based on chained dollars with a reference year that is consistent with the one used by the BEA in 2023. The resolution will be based on the first official release of the relevant data by the BEA after the fourth quarter of 2030. If the BEA has ceased to exist or no longer publishes the relevant data, the resolution will be based on the most authoritative and comparable data source available at the time. In the event of a significant revision of historical GDP data that affects the calculation, the resolution will be based on the revised data.
