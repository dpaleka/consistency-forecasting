Despite this, the article seems to focus on a definitive event with potential for binary resolution (e.g., whether specific cooperation goals are met).

Additionally, the content is truncated, further limiting the available information. Although the subject matter is not particularly sensitive, the lack of specificity and future-oriented content makes it unsuitable for the intended purpose of generating forecasting questions."}

The topic is not overly sensitive and provides numerical context (645 heat-related deaths last year).
