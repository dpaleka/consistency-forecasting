The WHO has been actively involved in enhancing mpox surveillance systems globally, particularly in Africa. 2. WHO reports and statements have highlighted efforts to improve testing capacity, data collection, and reporting systems in several countries. 3. Specifically, WHO has supported countries in obtaining regulatory approval for vaccine products, identifying target populations, and developing vaccination strategies. 4. WHO has also provided technical support for a vaccination strategy workshop in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has been working on strengthening laboratory diagnostic capacities, including genomic sequencing of viruses. 5. The WHO has published posters for health and care workers on how to put on and remove personal protective equipment and has developed an IPC Rapid Assessment Tool (RAT) for health facilities to rapidly assess IPC and WASH capacities. Given these efforts and the explicit mention of improvements in surveillance and response capabilities in WHO reports, it is reasonable to conclude that the WHO has reported improvements in mpox surveillance systems in at least two countries by August 2024.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has been actively working to improve mpox surveillance systems in various countries. As of the latest reports, several initiatives and improvements have been noted: 1. **Surveillance Enhancements**: WHO has been supporting countries to increase their preparedness and readiness capacities, including the implementation of standardized protocols, deployment of real-time reporting systems, and enhancement of data integration and sharing. This is evident in their efforts to support Member States in upgrading surveillance infrastructure and implementing community-based surveillance programs, particularly in high-risk areas. 2. **Specific Country Support**: For instance, WHO has supported South Africa through a review of protocols, national IPC guidelines for mpox, and strengthening the capacity of health and care workers through training. Additionally, WHO has conducted subnational readiness assessments in non-affected provinces and supported the development of contingency plans in priority and bordering countries. 3. **Regional and Global Coordination**: WHO has also been working with countries and vaccine manufacturers on potential vaccine donations and coordinating with partners to facilitate equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other tools. This includes efforts to improve laboratory diagnostic capacities, including genomic sequencing of viruses, which is crucial for detecting and tracking mpox cases. Given these points, it is clear that the WHO has reported improvements in mpox surveillance systems in multiple countries, including specific enhancements in South Africa and broader regional efforts.", "can_resolve_question": true, "answer": true}
