Verification of this must come from credible sources, including government agencies, reputable scientific organizations, or major news outlets such as BBC, The Guardian, or New York Times. In the event that multiple systems claim commercial viability, the resolution will be based on the first system that meets these criteria, with confirmation from the aforementioned sources.","resolution_date":"2049-12-31T00:00:00","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic","url":null,"metadata":{"source_question":"Will a breakthrough in physics lead to a new form of clean energy by 2040?"},"resolution":null}},"P":{"source_question":"Will a breakthrough in physics lead to a new form of clean energy by 2040?","source_id":"4e944d07-9397-4688-a8f9-50f538b490e1"},"Q":{"source_question":"Will a breakthrough in physics lead to a new form of clean energy by 2040?","source_id":"4e944d07-9397-4688-a8f9-50f538b490e1"},"R":{"source_question":"Will a breakthrough in physics lead to a new form of clean energy by 2040?","source_id":"4e944d07-9397-4688-a8f9-50f538b490e1"},"verification_result":{"reasoning":"","valid":true}}}
