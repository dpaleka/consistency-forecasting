The ban targets six categories of single-use plastics: checkout bags, cutlery, foodservice ware made from or containing problematic plastics, ring carriers, stir sticks, and straws.\n\n    2. **Current Status**: The ban on the manufacture and import of these items began on December 20, 2022, with the sale of these items prohibited starting December 20, 2023. The export of these items is slated to be banned by December 20, 2025.\n\n    3. **Legal Challenges**: There was a legal challenge to the ban, with the Federal Court ruling in favor of the industry, stating that the broad definition of \"toxic\" plastics was unreasonable and unconstitutional. However, the Federal Court of Appeal granted a stay, allowing the ban to remain in effect while the government's appeal is ongoing.\n\n    4. **Recent Developments**: As of the latest updates in April 2024, the ban remains in place due to the stay granted by the Federal Court of Appeal. This means that the single-use plastics ban is currently enforced and has not been officially reversed.\n\n    Given this information, it is clear that as of the current date (June 30, 2024), Canada's ban on single-use plastics remains in effect. Since there is no indication of an immediate reversal before August 2024, and considering the legal process is ongoing, we can conclude that the ban will likely continue through August 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":true}},"resolution":true}}}}

This means that a referendum on abortion rights cannot be initiated by citizens but must go through the legislative process.\n    2. **Current Abortion Laws in Texas**: Texas has a near-total ban on abortion, with recent legislation making performing an abortion a felony. This indicates a strong stance against abortion rights by the current legislative body.\n    3. **Absence of Referendum Plans**: There is no information or announcement from the Texas state government about conducting a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. In fact, the focus has been on local initiatives and legal challenges rather than a statewide referendum.\n    4. **Local Initiatives**: While there are local initiatives and discussions about abortion rights, such as the proposed abortion travel ban in Amarillo, these do not constitute a statewide referendum on enshrining protection for abortion rights.\n    \n    Given these points, it is clear that Texas will not hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. The legislative process, current laws, and absence of any plans for such a referendum support this conclusion.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

However, the search results indicate a Steven Parker in Volusia County, Florida, who was involved in contractor fraud, not procurement fraud. This discrepancy suggests the question might not be well-formed or accurate regarding the specific case.\n    2. **Additional Charges**: Despite the potential mismatch in the case type, we can still examine if a Steven Parker faced additional charges. According to the sources, Steven Parker in Volusia County was indeed charged with additional criminal counts related to contractor fraud and exploitation of an elderly veteran. These charges were reported in March 2024, which is before the resolution date of July 31, 2024.\n    3. **Relevance and Specificity**: The question's details specify that the new charges must be distinct from and in addition to the original counts. The sources confirm that Parker faced new charges for exploiting a 97-year-old veteran and for contractor fraud in additional cases, which are distinct from the initial charges.\n    4. **Conclusion**: Given the information available, it appears that a Steven Parker did face additional criminal charges by July 2024. However, due to the potential mismatch in the case type (procurement fraud vs. contractor fraud), there is a slight ambiguity. Despite this, the core of the question regarding additional charges seems to be resolved affirmatively based on the available data.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":true}},"resolution":true}}}}

For FY 2024, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $6.72 billion for the FDA.

The specific increase mentioned ($22 million) is significantly less than the required 20% increase.\n\n    Given this analysis, the question can be resolved as NO because the proposed increase does not meet the 20% threshold.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

The Challenge America program supports arts projects extending the reach of the arts to underserved groups/communities, but it does not directly address historical discrimination.\n\n    2. **USDA Discrimination Relief Payments**: The USDA has initiated a program to provide financial assistance to farmers who experienced discrimination in its lending programs. While this program addresses discrimination, it is not specifically for minority artists but for farmers and ranchers.\n\n    3. **OHCHR and Minority Artists**: The OHCHR discusses minority artists and dissidence, but it does not provide information on federal grants addressing past discrimination in the context of the United States.\n\n    4. **Arts in Society Grant**: The Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade offers the Arts in Society Grant, which funds projects addressing civic and social challenges in Colorado communities.

The scholarships are competitive and based on academic achievement, leadership, and community service.\n    2. **Princeton University Funding**: Princeton University and its Department of Economics offer various funding opportunities for students, including research funding for Junior Independent Work and senior thesis projects, as well as support for economics-related unpaid summer internships and participation in economics competitions and conferences.\n    3. **Coca-Cola's Funding Scope**: There is no information indicating that Coca-Cola funds full tuition for all Princeton economics students. The Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation's scholarships are awarded to individual students based on merit and are not specific to covering full tuition for all students in a particular department at any university.\n    4. **Princeton University's Funding Mechanisms**: Princeton University uses the Student Activity Funding Engine (SAFE) for managing student funding, which includes various sources and types of funding but does not mention a comprehensive tuition coverage by Coca-Cola for all economics students.\n\n    Given the information above, it is clear that Coca-Cola does not fund full tuition for all Princeton economics students.

The Missouri Supreme Court ruled to allow a proposed amendment concerning abortion rights to be included on the ballot in November 2024.

Official statements and announcements from the White House and reputable news outlets.\n\n    The sources indicate that President Biden had planned to speak at the National Education Association (NEA) convention in Philadelphia but canceled his speech due to a strike by the NEA staff union. The strike led to the cancellation of the last three days of the convention, including the day President Biden was scheduled to speak.\n\n    Given this information, it is clear that President Biden did not deliver a speech at the NEA event as planned due to the strike. Since the question pertains to a speech at a \"National Teachers Association\" event and the closest relevant information is about the NEA, it can be inferred that the question is likely referring to the NEA event. However, it's crucial to note that the exact organization name in the question (\"National Teachers Association\") does not match the one found in the sources (\"National Education Association\").\n\n    Despite this discrepancy, considering the context and the information available, it is reasonable to conclude that the question is referring to the NEA event.

According to the Maryland Department of Health's announcement on July 11, 2024, the Medicaid enrollment stood at 1,684,462 as of May 31, 2024, which is after the pandemic-related automatic enrollments were re-evaluated.\n    2. **Pre-Pandemic Enrollment**: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the enrollment was 1,415,631.

Given the recent activities and announcements from both countries, we can analyze the following points: 1. **Defense Cooperation**: There have been significant developments in defense cooperation between France and Saudi Arabia. For instance, the Commander of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) Admiral Fahd Al-Ghufaili visited Paris and met with the Chief of Staff of the French Navy Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, discussing various defense projects and technologies, including submarines. Additionally, Saudi Arabia and France signed an executive plan for cooperation on capabilities, military industries, and R&D, indicating a deepening of their defense ties. 2. **Economic and Energy Cooperation**: France has been engaging in talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to diversify Europe's energy supplies, aiming to reduce dependence on Russian energy sources. This indicates a new area of cooperation focused on energy security. 3. **Industrial and Technological Collaboration**: The participation of Saudi Arabia in the Eurosatory 2024 defense exhibition in Paris, where the Saudi pavilion showcased the kingdom's military industries and invited global investors, highlights efforts to enhance industrial and technological collaboration between the two countries. Given these developments, it is clear that France and Saudi Arabia have indeed implemented new forms of cooperation, particularly in defense and energy sectors, by July 2024. These initiatives are distinctly different from their existing partnerships as of October 1, 2023, and have been confirmed by official statements and reported by reputable sources.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":true}},"resolution":true}}}}

For example, on May 6, 2024, the RBI imposed a monetary penalty on Federal Bank Limited.\n\n    2. **Specific Curbs on Federal Bank**: The question specifically asks about new regulatory curbs on Federal Bank's lending practices. The available information does not indicate any new curbs specifically targeting Federal Bank's lending by August 31, 2024. The penalties mentioned were due to general regulatory deficiencies and not specifically aimed at lending practices.\n\n    3. **Co-branded Credit Card Curbs**: There was a regulatory action related to co-branded credit cards, where the RBI barred Federal Bank and South Indian Bank from issuing new co-branded credit cards due to regulatory deficiencies. However, this action was taken in March 2024 and does not constitute a new curb imposed by August 2024.\n\n    4. **Lack of New Curbs**: Given the information available up to August 2024, there is no evidence of the RBI imposing new regulatory curbs specifically targeting Federal Bank's lending practices.\n\n    Therefore, based on the available data, the question can be resolved as NO, indicating that no new regulatory curbs were imposed on Federal Bank's lending by August 31, 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

The court granted petitioners' motion to stay pending review, indicating that the petitioners were likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to the Order. This means the rule's reinstatement is still pending legal review and not effectively reinstated as of the resolution date.\n\n    Therefore, despite the FCC's efforts to reinstate net neutrality, the legal challenges and the court's stay mean the rule was not effectively reinstated by August 31, 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

This plea was made on July 22, 2024, which is within the timeframe of our question.\n\n    2. **Nature of Charges**: The charges to which Dean pleaded no contest were related to cruelty to the infirmed, Medicaid fraud, and obstruction of justice, all stemming from the evacuation of his nursing homes during Hurricane Ida. These charges are indeed connected to incidents where nursing home residents were endangered during a flood (Hurricane Ida).\n\n    3. **New Charges**: However, the question specifically asks for new charges distinct from those to which Dean has already pleaded no contest. The provided sources do not mention any new charges being filed against Bob Dean Jr. by July 31, 2024, that are separate from the ones he pleaded no contest to.\n\n    4. **Conclusion**: Since there is no information about new charges being filed against Bob Dean Jr. related to flood incidents by July 31, 2024, that are distinct from the charges he has already pleaded no contest to, we can resolve this question.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

For instance, in his statement on the two-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, Schumer highlighted the act's impact on clean energy and environmental justice without indicating any retraction or alteration of his views on Biden's stance.\n\n    2. **Recent News and Statements**: There is no recent news or statement from Schumer that suggests he has retracted or significantly altered his views on Biden's renewable energy policies. In fact, recent statements from Schumer have been consistent in supporting renewable energy initiatives, such as his comments on confirming nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which do not indicate any change in his stance.\n\n    3. **Criticism of Schumer's Stance on Nuclear Energy**: While Schumer has faced criticism for his apparent embrace of new nuclear energy development, which some see as a betrayal of renewable energy options, this does not constitute a retraction or alteration of his statements about Biden's stance on renewable energy.\n\n    Given the information available, there is no evidence that Chuck Schumer has publicly retracted or significantly altered his statement regarding Joe Biden's position on renewable energy by the specified date.

The Apple Health Expansion program, which is the specific Medicaid expansion program in question, has an enrollment cap far below 450,000, making it impossible for it to enroll over 450,000 people by July 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

Reputable international news outlets such as Reuters, Bloomberg, and Associated Press for any reports on Spain eliminating export taxes on agricultural products.\n\n    The information available indicates that Spain's agricultural trade policies, especially in relation to the United Kingdom post-Brexit, focus on maintaining zero tariffs and quotas as per the agreement between the EU and the UK. However, there is no specific mention of eliminating export taxes on agricultural products in the sources provided.\n\n    The latest trade reports and data up to 2023 and early 2024 do not indicate any move by Spain to eliminate export taxes on agricultural products. The focus has been on the overall trade balance, sectoral data, and specific product exports rather than on the elimination of export taxes.\n\n    Given the lack of information on the elimination of export taxes specifically by July 31, 2024, and considering that the sources do not mention any such policy change, it appears that the question cannot be resolved affirmatively.

Given that we have reached this date and no confirmation has been made through the specified channels, we can confidently resolve this question.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

Specifically:\n    - The official websites and news releases of the U.S. Congress do not contain any such proposal.\n    - None of the major reputable national news outlets have reported on this topic.\n    - The search results provided discuss existing regulations and studies on nursing home preparedness but do not mention a new federal law proposal.\n\n    The question clearly states that if no such new law is proposed by July 31, 2024, the question will resolve as NO. Given that we have reached this date and no proposal has been made through the specified channels, we can confidently resolve this question.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

It must be directly linked to an attack by a regional militant group on a tanker in the Caspian Sea.\n\n    2. **Available Information**:\n    - **Source** and **Source** discuss a potential oil spill near the Kashagan oil field in the Caspian Sea, reported by an environmental group. However, the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC) denied these claims, stating that satellite images showed natural phenomena rather than an oil spill. This incident does not meet the criteria specified in the question as it is not linked to an attack by a regional militant group.\n    - **Source** also mentions the same alleged oil spill, but again, it does not fit the criteria of being caused by a militant attack.\n    - **Source** discusses environmental damage in the Caspian Sea due to military activities, specifically mentioning the impact of missile launches and military exercises on marine life. However, it does not mention any oil spills resulting from militant attacks.\n    - **Source** is irrelevant to the Caspian Sea, as it discusses an oil spill in Manila Bay, Philippines.\n\n    3. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information up to the current date (2024-09-21), there is no evidence of a major oil spill in the Caspian Sea caused by a regional militant group attacking a tanker by August 2024.

To resolve this, we need to look at the available information up to July 2024.\n\n    1. **EPA Grant for Climate Goals**: Oregon received almost $200 million from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for various climate-related projects, including electric vehicle incentives and infrastructure. This grant is part of the EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program but does not specifically mention electric vehicle manufacturing or assembly projects.\n\n    2. **NEVI Program Funding**: Oregon received $52 million through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program to expand public fast-charging electric vehicle stations across the state. This funding is specifically for EV charging infrastructure, not manufacturing or assembly.\n\n    3. **Additional Grants**: Other grants mentioned include $15 million for the city of Tualatin and surrounding areas to install EV charging stations, and nearly $1.9 million for the city of Albany to build EV charging stations at various locations. These are also for EV charging infrastructure.\n\n    4. **West Coast Truck Charging and Fueling Corridor Project**: Oregon is part of a collaborative project with California and Washington to deploy charging and hydrogen fueling stations for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, with California receiving $102 million for this project. However, the specific amount allocated to Oregon for this project is not detailed in the provided sources.\n\n    Adding up the grants specifically for electric vehicle-related projects in Oregon that are mentioned:\n    - $200 million (EPA grant for broader climate goals, including EV incentives)\n    - $52 million (NEVI program for fast-charging stations)\n    - $15 million (Tualatin and surrounding areas for EV charging)\n    - $1.9 million (Albany for EV charging stations)\n\n    The total from these sources is $268.9 million. However, not all of these funds are explicitly for electric vehicle manufacturing or assembly projects, as required by the question. The EPA grant, while significant, is for broader climate goals and includes but is not limited to EV initiatives.\n\n    Given the information available and the specific criteria of the question, it appears that Oregon did not receive over $300 million in federal grants specifically for electric vehicle manufacturing, assembly, or related projects by July 2024. However, the lack of clarity on the allocation of funds within the broader grants and the specific focus on manufacturing or assembly projects makes a definitive answer challenging.\n\n    Considering the strict criteria and the need for explicit designation for electric vehicle-related initiatives within Oregon, the question leans towards a resolution of NO based on the available data. However, given the complexity and the potential for additional grants not covered in the provided sources, caution is warranted.\n\n    Therefore, while the evidence suggests a NO, the question's specificity and the potential for unreported grants up to July 2024 introduce uncertainty. However, based on the information provided and adhering strictly to the question's criteria, the most accurate response given the data would be NO, but with an acknowledgment of the limitations in the available information.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

Instead, they discuss the broader issue of AI-generated misinformation on various social media platforms.\n    - Pinterest CEO Bill Ready discusses the company's use of AI for creating a safe and positive online environment, but there is no mention of Pinterest's AI algorithms spreading election misinformation.\n\n    The question clearly states that if no such reports or warnings are issued by August 31, 2024, the question will resolve as NO. Given that we have reached this date and no credible reports have been found through the specified channels, we can confidently resolve this question.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

This amnesty law would release all those convicted for promoting or procuring the secession or independence of Catalonia in connection with the 2017 referendum, lift all outstanding arrest warrants, and stop all ongoing judicial proceedings against those involved.\n    2. **Recent Developments**: The amnesty law's implementation means that those previously convicted or facing charges related to the 2017 referendum would be pardoned and not subject to bans from holding public office due to these charges.\n    3. **Carles Puigdemont's Return**: In August 2024, Carles Puigdemont, the former leader of Catalonia, returned to Spain despite an outstanding arrest warrant.
