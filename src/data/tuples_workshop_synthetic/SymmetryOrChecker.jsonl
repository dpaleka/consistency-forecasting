The event and its impact on global health security must be confirmed by at least three reputable news organizations (BBC, The Guardian, New York Times, Washington Post) or official statements from international health organizations (WHO, CDC). In the absence of direct evidence, a consensus among experts in international relations and global health, as reported by the aforementioned sources, will be considered sufficient. The resolution will consider the direct and immediate effects of the geopolitical event, not long-term consequences that unfold over years. (b) Before January 1, 2025, a member of the US Senate introduces a bill that significantly alters the United States' nuclear energy policy. Significant alteration includes, but is not limited to, changes in funding, safety regulations, waste management, or the construction of new nuclear power plants.
