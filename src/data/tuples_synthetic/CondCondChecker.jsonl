The passage of the bill must be confirmed by an official government announcement or documentation. In the absence of a public announcement, credible reports from at least three major news organizations (BBC, The Guardian, New York Times, Washington Post, Reuters) are sufficient. In the event of a partial implementation of the bill's provisions (e.g., if certain sections are not enacted or are delayed), the question will resolve as Yes only if the implemented sections include significant changes to at least two of the areas mentioned above.\n\nFor part (b), a \"significant geopolitical initiative\" is defined as an effort or project that has a substantial impact on international relations, global policies, or geopolitical landscapes, and involves collaboration or engagement with one or more national governments, international organizations, or significant non-state actors. The initiative must be aimed at addressing major global challenges such as climate change, cybersecurity, digital privacy, international trade, or global health crises. Confirmation must come from official Microsoft announcements or documentation. In the absence of a public announcement, credible reports from at least three major news organizations (BBC, The Guardian, Reuters, Bloomberg, New York Times, Washington Post) are sufficient. In the event of ambiguity or disputed claims, the resolution will defer to the consensus of reputable news sources.\n\nFor part (c), a \"major technological breakthrough\" is defined as a development that significantly advances the field of AI in terms of capabilities, efficiency, or understanding, and is recognized as such by a consensus of experts in the field or a leading AI research institution. The influence of philosophical theories must be explicitly acknowledged in the official announcement of the breakthrough, or in the primary scientific literature describing the breakthrough (e.g., peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers). The acknowledgment must specify how philosophical theories influenced the breakthrough, whether in the design, conceptual framework, or implementation of the AI technology. In the absence of an official announcement, credible reports from at least three major news organizations (BBC, The Guardian, Reuters, Bloomberg, New York Times, Washington Post) are sufficient to confirm the breakthrough and its philosophical influence. If multiple breakthroughs meet these criteria, the question will resolve as Yes upon the first such confirmation.","resolution_date":"2030-12-31T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"metadata":{"base_sentences":{"P":{"id":"fcd3d7a9-ff05-4b85-b17b-400133856a88","title":"Will the US Congress pass a major electoral reform bill before 2030?","body":"This question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2030, the US Congress passes a major electoral reform bill.
