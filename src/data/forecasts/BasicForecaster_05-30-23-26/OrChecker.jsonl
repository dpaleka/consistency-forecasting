(b) A significant breakthrough in the field of social physics is announced and has influenced public policy. A \"significant breakthrough\" is defined as a discovery or development that fundamentally changes the understanding or application of social physics in a way that directly impacts public policy formulation or implementation. The breakthrough must be documented in a peer-reviewed scientific journal or presented at a major scientific conference. The influence on public policy must be evidenced by the adoption of new policies, significant amendments to existing policies, or the initiation of public policy debates directly attributable to the breakthrough.
