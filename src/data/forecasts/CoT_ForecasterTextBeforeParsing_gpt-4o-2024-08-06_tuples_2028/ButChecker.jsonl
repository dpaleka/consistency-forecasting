Firstly, the political climate in Canada regarding energy independence must be evaluated. Historically, Canada has not frequently held national referendums; the last one was in 1992 on constitutional matters. Energy independence is a significant issue, but it has not been a central topic for national referendums in the past. Secondly, the current political landscape and government priorities are crucial. The Liberal government, led by Justin Trudeau as of the last data update in October 2023, has focused on climate change and energy transition, but not explicitly on energy independence as a national referendum issue. Additionally, referendums are complex and costly processes that require substantial political will and public support. Thirdly, public opinion and movements pushing for energy independence would play a role. While there are discussions around energy policies and independence, these have not reached a level that suggests an imminent referendum. Finally, the timeline is also important. The question specifies a period between October 2024 and January 2028. This is a relatively short timeframe for organizing and executing a national referendum, especially if the issue is not currently at the forefront of national political discourse. Given these considerations, while it is not impossible for Canada to hold such a referendum, the probability seems low based on current trends and historical precedent."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "a3a914f4-ea04-459b-96d2-1d294d588b76", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The United States officially implements a nationwide ban on single-use plastic bags before January 1, 2028, AND (b) Canada does not hold a national referendum on energy independence before January 1, 2028?", "body": "(a) This question will be resolved as 'Yes' if the United States government officially implements a nationwide ban on single-use plastic bags between October 1, 2024 and January 1, 2028.

(a) The likelihood of the United States implementing a nationwide ban on single-use plastic bags by January 1, 2028, depends on several factors, including political will, environmental policy trends, and public opinion. As of the last few years, there has been increasing momentum in the U.S. towards reducing plastic waste, with many states and cities already implementing bans or restrictions on single-use plastics. However, a nationwide ban would require significant federal action, which can be challenging due to political polarization and lobbying by industries that produce or rely on plastic bags. While there is a growing environmental movement and public support for reducing plastic waste, the implementation of a nationwide ban by 2028 remains uncertain and would likely require a strong push from both the executive branch and Congress. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of this occurring to be moderate. (b) The likelihood of Canada not holding a national referendum on energy independence by January 1, 2028, is relatively high. Canada has a stable political system and typically does not hold national referendums frequently. Energy independence is a significant issue, but it is more likely to be addressed through legislative and policy measures rather than a national referendum. Additionally, there has been no recent indication that a national referendum on this topic is being planned. Given these considerations, the probability of Canada not holding such a referendum is high. To find the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event. Assuming a moderate probability of the U.S. implementing a ban (let's say 0.4) and a high probability of Canada not holding a referendum (let's say 0.8), the combined probability would be 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "f6c8b7c3-fedc-455c-931e-1ca3f0b38748", "title": "Will either Canada hold a national referendum on energy independence or the United States implement a nationwide ban on single-use plastic bags before January 1, 2028?", "body": "This question will be resolved as 'Yes' if either of the following occurs between October 1, 2024, and January 1, 2028: (a) Canada holds a national referendum on energy independence.

Currently, Japanese companies are not known to be in the top tier for genetic R&D expenditure, making this scenario less likely unless there is a significant shift in strategy or investment.\n\n(b) Taiwan's temperature increase: Climate change is causing global temperatures to rise, but a 1.5\u00b0C increase in average annual temperature over the 1991-2020 baseline within a few years is quite substantial. While local variations and extreme weather events can cause temporary spikes, a sustained increase of this magnitude over a few years is less common. However, given the unpredictability of climate change and potential for rapid changes, this scenario cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\nConsidering both conditions, the probability of at least one occurring by January 1, 2028, is not negligible but also not very high.

However, the idea of criminalizing climate change denial is more extreme and involves significant political and legal implications.\n\n2. **Legal Precedents**: Currently, there are no known instances of countries criminalizing climate change denial. While some countries have laws against misinformation or hate speech, extending these to cover climate change denial would be unprecedented.\n\n3. **Public Opinion and Advocacy**: There is growing public support for strong climate action, and some advocacy groups may push for stricter measures against misinformation. However, criminalizing denial could face significant opposition on the grounds of free speech and political freedom, especially in democratic nations.\n\n4. **International Influence**: International bodies like the United Nations emphasize the importance of combating climate change, but they typically focus on collaborative efforts rather than punitive measures against individuals' beliefs.\n\n5. **Feasibility and Enforcement**: Even if a government were inclined to criminalize climate change denial, the practicalities of defining and enforcing such a law would be complex.

However, geopolitical developments can be unpredictable, and the EU might accelerate accession processes under certain circumstances.\n\nTaking both factors into account, the probability of each event occurring individually is relatively high for Spain's renewable energy target and moderately low for EU enlargement within the given timeframe. However, since both events need to occur simultaneously for the question to resolve as \"Yes,\" the overall probability is a combination of these two independent probabilities."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "53792bae-a280-455c-8eb0-8cbcb8378286", "title": "Will either a new country join the European Union or Spain generate at least 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by January 1, 2028?", "body": "This question will resolve as 'Yes' if either of the following occurs: (a) A new country becomes a member of the European Union between October 1, 2024, and January 1, 2028, with official recognition and completion of all necessary accession procedures.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, several countries are candidates or potential candidates, including Western Balkan countries like Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. However, the accession process typically takes many years, often over a decade, and is subject to political, economic, and institutional reforms in the candidate country, as well as political will within the EU.

As of recent reports, Spain has been generating a substantial portion of its electricity from renewable sources, with some months approaching or exceeding 50%. Spain's National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC) aims for 74% of electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2030.

Countries with strong democratic traditions and free speech protections may be less likely to implement such laws. However, some countries with more authoritarian governance structures might consider it, especially if they are significantly impacted by climate change. Overall, while possible, this scenario seems less likely within the given timeframe. (b) Publication of a peer-reviewed paper identifying a new method for reducing ocean plastic pollution: Scientific research in environmental science is active and ongoing, with a high likelihood of new discoveries and innovations. Given the global focus on reducing ocean pollution, it is plausible that researchers will develop new methods and publish them in reputable journals within the next few years. The criteria for this event to resolve as \"Yes\" are clear and achievable, making it more likely than the first scenario. Considering the two scenarios, the likelihood of a peer-reviewed paper being published is significantly higher than the criminalization of climate change denial. Therefore, the probability of the question resolving \"Yes\" is primarily driven by the second event."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3138824102871722, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Other NATO countries, such as European nations, have space programs but typically collaborate with larger agencies like NASA or ESA for major missions. Given the complexity and cost involved, it is more likely that any effort to establish a permanent presence would occur through international collaboration rather than a single NATO member acting alone. Additionally, the timeline from October 2024 to January 2028 is relatively short for planning, funding, and executing such a mission.

While these technologies exist and are used for certain types of missions (e.g., deep space missions), they are not currently used for launching spacecraft from Earth's surface due to their low thrust-to-weight ratio.\n\nGiven the current state of technology, it's unlikely that a private company will develop a launch system powered entirely by renewable energy by 2028. Such a development would require significant advancements in propulsion technology, as well as substantial investment and testing. While companies like SpaceX have made rapid advancements in space technology, the timeline for such a breakthrough seems short.\n\nFurthermore, the requirement for the launch to be confirmed by an independent space agency or authoritative body adds an additional layer of complexity, as it implies a high standard of verification and credibility.\n\nOverall, while there is significant interest in sustainable space exploration, the technological and logistical challenges make it unlikely that a spacecraft powered entirely by renewable energy will be launched by a private company before the specified date."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "a4c02eb7-e4ba-44bf-ac8a-2e7ca824e673", "title": "Will both of the following occur before January 1, 2028: (a) Elon Musk hosts or co-hosts Saturday Night Live (SNL) again and (b) neither SpaceX nor any other private company launches a spacecraft powered entirely by renewable energy to space?", "body": "This question will be resolved as 'Yes' if both of the following occur between October 1, 2024, and January 1, 2028: (a) Elon Musk hosts or co-hosts an episode of Saturday Night Live (SNL), confirmed by NBC and documented on the official SNL website or social media channels, and (b) neither SpaceX nor any other private company successfully launches a spacecraft powered entirely by renewable energy to space, with the launch not being confirmed by the company or verified by an independent space agency or authoritative body.", "resolution_date": "2028-01-01T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-10-01T00:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.4, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To resolve the question as \"Yes,\" two conditions must be met by January 1, 2028: (a) Elon Musk must host or co-host Saturday Night Live again, and (b) no private company, including SpaceX, must launch a spacecraft powered entirely by renewable energy to space.\n\nFor condition (a), Elon Musk has previously hosted SNL in May 2021, which indicates that it is within the realm of possibility for him to host again.

France has historically had a cautious approach to biotechnology, especially concerning genetically modified organisms (GMOs). However, biotechnology is a broad field, and not all areas are subject to the same level of scrutiny.\n\nThe European Union, of which France is a member, has a significant influence on national policies related to biotechnology. The EU has stringent regulations on GMOs, but it also supports biotechnology development in areas like medicine and sustainable agriculture. France's national policy would need to align with EU regulations, which could either restrict or support biotechnology research depending on the specific area.\n\nThe political landscape in France is another critical factor. If there is a shift towards more conservative or environmentally-focused leadership, the likelihood of restrictive policies could increase. Conversely, a government with a strong focus on innovation and economic growth might be less inclined to impose restrictions.\n\nPublic opinion and activism also play roles. If there are significant public concerns about biotechnology risks, this could pressure the government to implement restrictions. Conversely, a strong public push for technological advancement and economic benefits might deter restrictive policies.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a possibility of France implementing some form of restriction on biotechnology research, it is not highly certain.

Historically, Tesla as a company has not officially endorsed political candidates, although Musk himself has expressed personal political opinions. The possibility of Tesla making an official endorsement in the 2028 election seems low, as it would be a significant deviation from their typical corporate behavior. Corporate endorsements can be risky, potentially alienating parts of the customer base, and Tesla has not shown a pattern of engaging in such endorsements.\n\n2. **Japan Launching a Manned Mission to the Moon**: Japan, through its space agency JAXA, has been actively involved in space exploration but has not yet launched a manned mission to the Moon. Japan's space program has focused on robotic missions and collaborations with other space agencies, like NASA. While Japan has expressed interest in participating in lunar missions, planning and executing a manned mission to the Moon involves substantial technological, financial, and logistical challenges.

The company has been working on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, which aims to enable autonomous driving, but it is currently not at Level 5.\n\nSeveral factors influence the probability of Tesla reaching this milestone by the specified date. First, technological challenges remain significant. Achieving Level 5 autonomy requires solving complex problems related to perception, decision-making, and control in diverse and unpredictable environments. While Tesla has a robust data collection and processing infrastructure, these challenges are non-trivial and have yet to be fully overcome by any company.\n\nSecond, regulatory hurdles must be considered.

Historically, France has been proactive in addressing climate change, as evidenced by its role in the Paris Agreement and its ambitious climate policies. However, criminalizing climate change denial is a significant step that involves complex legal, social, and political considerations. 1. Legal and Political Context: Criminalizing an ideology or belief, such as climate change denial, would require substantial legal frameworks and could face significant opposition on the grounds of freedom of speech and expression. France, like many democracies, values these freedoms, and any legislation perceived as infringing upon them could be controversial. 2. Precedents and International Influence: There is currently no precedent for a major democratic nation criminalizing climate change denial. While some countries have laws against Holocaust denial, these are based on historical and moral grounds that differ from the scientific debate surrounding climate change. France may be cautious about setting such a precedent without international consensus. 3. Public Opinion and Political Will: Public opinion in France generally supports strong action on climate change, but translating this into criminal legislation is another matter. The political will to pursue such a path would need to be strong, and it would likely require a shift in the political landscape or a significant environmental event to galvanize support. 4. Timeline: The timeframe until January 1, 2028, provides some room for political and social change. However, given the complexity and potential controversy of such legislation, it may be unlikely to occur within this period without significant shifts in the aforementioned factors.

This trend is likely to continue and even accelerate over the next few years.\n\n2. **Ukraine's Defense Needs**: Given the ongoing conflict with Russia and the need for modernizing its military, Ukraine has strong incentives to adopt advanced technologies, including AI, to enhance its defense capabilities.\n\n3. **International Support and Partnerships**: Ukraine has received significant military aid and technological support from Western countries. This support could include assistance in developing or acquiring AI-based defense systems.\n\n4. **Time Frame**: The time frame of over three years provides ample opportunity for development, testing, and deployment of such systems, especially if Ukraine prioritizes this as part of its defense strategy.\n\n5. **Government and Public Statements**: If there are any official statements or strategic documents from the Ukrainian government indicating an interest in AI-based defense systems, this would increase the likelihood of deployment.\n\n6. **Challenges and Constraints**: Potential challenges include technological barriers, financial constraints, and the need for integration with existing military infrastructure.

Economic considerations could also play a role, as space collaborations can be costly and require significant investment from both parties. 4. Technological Capabilities: Mexico's space program is still developing, and while it has made strides in educational and satellite programs, it may not yet have the technological capabilities to engage in a large-scale collaboration with NASA. However, smaller scale projects or educational collaborations could be possible. 5. Timeframe: The timeframe given (October 2024 to January 2028) is relatively long, which increases the likelihood of some form of collaboration being announced, especially if both countries see mutual benefits in such a partnership. 6. Strategic Interests: NASA may have strategic interests in increasing collaborations with Latin American countries to foster regional cooperation and support for space exploration. This could be a motivating factor for initiating a collaboration with Mexico. Considering these factors, while there is a possibility of a collaboration being announced, the probability is moderated by Mexico's current capabilities and NASA's existing collaboration priorities."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "39adab73-ee40-467b-aed3-f41bdf08f20d", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) A member of the US Congress endorses machine learning for legislative decision-making by 2028, and (b) NASA does not announce a new international space collaboration involving Mexico by 2028?", "body": "This question will resolve as 'Yes' if both of the following conditions are met: (a) Between the creation date of this question and January 1, 2028, a current member of the US Congress publicly endorses the use of machine learning for legislative decision-making.

Russia has shown some interest in environmental issues, but its policies have not been as aggressive as those in the EU or other regions leading the charge. 2. **Current Legislation and Initiatives**: As of 2023, Russia has made some strides in environmental policy, but there hasn't been a strong legislative push towards banning single-use plastics. Any movement towards such a ban would likely require significant political will and public support. 3. **Economic and Industrial Considerations**: Russia's economy is heavily reliant on industries that may be impacted by a ban on single-use plastics, such as manufacturing and oil (which is a raw material for plastics). The economic implications could slow down the adoption of such policies. 4. **Public and Political Will**: While environmental awareness is growing globally, the level of public demand and political will in Russia to tackle issues like single-use plastics is not as high as in some other countries. This could impact the likelihood of implementing a nationwide ban. 5. **International Influence and Agreements**: Russia's participation in international environmental agreements could influence its domestic policies. However, Russia has often prioritized national interests over international environmental commitments. Considering these factors, while there is a possibility that Russia might implement more stringent environmental policies in the future, the probability of a nationwide ban on single-use plastics being enacted and implemented by January 1, 2028, seems moderate to low.

The U.S. has historically supported Taiwan's right to self-determination, which complicates China's efforts to initiate talks on reunification.\n\n3. **Economic Interdependence**: Economic ties between China and Taiwan are strong, and a mutual interest in maintaining stability for economic reasons could incentivize talks.

Since the lifting of some sanctions under the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) in 2015, Iran has sought to expand its trade relations. However, international relations and sanctions have fluctuated, impacting its ability to form new trade agreements. - Iran has been actively seeking to strengthen economic ties with non-Western countries, notably China, Russia, and regional neighbors.

In recent years, the NBA has been expanding its international presence, particularly in markets like China and Europe, which could contribute to higher revenue. As of the 2022-2023 season, the NBA's revenue was reported to be around $10 billion. Assuming a steady growth rate and the potential for new revenue streams, it is plausible that the NBA could reach or exceed $15 billion by the 2027-2028 season. However, this is contingent on continued growth and no significant disruptions (e.g., economic downturns or major global events affecting sports viewership and attendance).\n\n(b) No Nationwide Ban on Single-Use Plastic Bags: The United States has seen increasing environmental awareness and legislative action at state and local levels regarding the reduction of plastic waste. However, implementing a nationwide ban on single-use plastic bags would require federal legislation, which can be challenging due to political polarization and differing priorities among states. As of now, there has been no strong indication of imminent federal action on this issue, although there is growing pressure from environmental groups.
