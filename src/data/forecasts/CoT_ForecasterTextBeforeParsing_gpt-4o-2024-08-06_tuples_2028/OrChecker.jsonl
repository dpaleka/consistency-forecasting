However, the U.S. federal government has historically shown a preference for state-level regulation over federal mandates in areas like plastic use. Some states and cities have already implemented their bans, but there is no federal law yet.\n\n2. **Political Will**: The implementation of a nationwide ban would require either new federal legislation or an executive order. This would depend heavily on the political climate, including the composition of Congress and the priorities of the sitting President. If the political landscape is favorable towards environmental regulation, the probability increases.\n\n3. **Public Opinion and Advocacy**: Public opinion is increasingly favoring environmental protection measures. Advocacy groups are actively pushing for bans on single-use plastics, which could influence policymakers.\n\n4. **International Trends**: Many countries have already implemented similar bans, which could pressure the U.S. to follow suit, especially if international environmental agreements or trade implications are involved.\n\n5. **Economic Considerations**: The economic impact on industries that produce or rely on single-use plastics could be a significant barrier.

While there have been few examples of such candidates in the past, the trend towards valuing scientific expertise in political roles may increase the chances. However, gubernatorial elections are highly competitive and often dominated by candidates with more traditional political backgrounds. As of 2023, there have been no prominent governors with a direct biotechnology background, which suggests this scenario is relatively unlikely but not impossible over a four-year span.\n\n2. **Environmentally Friendly Drug Approved by the FDA**:\n   - The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly focusing on sustainability, driven by regulatory pressures and consumer demand. The FDA has been supportive of innovative treatments, including environmentally friendly drugs. However, the specific requirement that the drug must be both new and explicitly marketed as environmentally friendly adds complexity. While there is a clear trend towards developing such drugs, the strict criteria and lengthy approval process mean that only a few new drugs meet these standards annually.

The outcome of the 2024 and 2026 elections will significantly influence Congress's composition and its stance on climate policy. If Democrats control both the House and the Senate, the probability of passing such legislation increases.  Secondly, public opinion and pressure from environmental groups can play a role. As climate change impacts become more apparent, public support for climate action could grow, potentially swaying moderate or undecided legislators. Additionally, international pressure and commitments, such as those from the Paris Agreement, might push the US towards more ambitious targets. Economic factors also matter. If the transition to renewable energy is seen as economically beneficial, with job creation and technological advancements, it might garner bipartisan support.

In recent years, China's annual exports have been close to or exceeded $3 trillion. For example, in 2022, China's exports were around $3.6 trillion, indicating that reaching or exceeding the $3 trillion mark is within the realm of possibility.\n\n2. **Economic Growth and Trade Policies**: China's economic growth, although slowing compared to previous decades, still supports robust trade activities. Additionally, China's trade policies and agreements, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), are likely to bolster trade volumes.\n\n3. **Global Economic Conditions**: Global demand for Chinese goods is a crucial factor. The global economy is expected to recover post-pandemic, which could drive demand for exports. However, potential risks such as geopolitical tensions, trade wars, or global recessions could impact this.\n\n4. **Technological Advancements and Supply Chain**: China's advancements in technology and manufacturing efficiency could enhance its export capabilities. Furthermore, diversification of supply chains might benefit China as companies look for reliable manufacturing bases.\n\n5. **Currency Fluctuations and Inflation**: Exchange rates and inflation can affect the nominal value of exports. A depreciating yuan could make Chinese goods cheaper and more competitive internationally, potentially boosting export figures.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is plausible that China's exports could exceed $3 trillion in at least one of the years within the specified period.

This might deter some countries from committing to a full phase-out, especially if they face challenges in scaling up renewable energy infrastructure. 3. Geopolitical and Economic Factors: Rising energy prices, geopolitical tensions, and the need for energy independence may make countries cautious about decommissioning nuclear power plants without a reliable alternative. The war in Ukraine and its impact on energy supplies has increased the EU's focus on energy security. 4.

The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a substantial reduction in industrial activity, which initially reduced emissions. However, economic recovery and industrial growth in subsequent years may have offset some of these reductions.\n\n2. **Current Policies and Commitments**: Ukraine is a signatory to the Paris Agreement and has set national targets for emission reductions. The country has been working on energy efficiency improvements, increasing renewable energy capacity, and implementing policies to reduce emissions. However, the effectiveness and implementation of these policies are crucial in determining whether the target can be met.\n\n3. **Impact of External Factors**: The ongoing conflict with Russia could significantly impact Ukraine's ability to achieve these reductions. The conflict has already disrupted economic activities and infrastructure, which might either hinder or inadvertently contribute to emission reductions depending on the sectors affected.\n\n4. **International Support and Collaboration**: Ukraine's ability to meet its targets may also depend on international support, both in terms of funding and technical assistance.

A 15% growth over this period translates to an annual growth rate of around 4.4%. Historically, the U.S. economy grows at an average annual rate of about 2-3%, with Virginia often performing slightly better due to its diverse economy, which includes a strong tech sector and proximity to federal government spending. However, achieving a sustained 4.4% annual growth rate is challenging without significant economic catalysts. Factors such as technological advancements, favorable policy changes, or significant increases in federal spending could contribute to such growth, but these are speculative. Additionally, economic downturns or recessions could impede this growth. (b) Ukraine's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction: Ukraine has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions as part of international agreements like the Paris Accord. A 40% reduction from 1990 levels is substantial, but Ukraine has already made significant progress due to economic restructuring and energy efficiency improvements since the 1990s. However, achieving this target would require continued investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as political and economic stability. Given the ongoing conflict with Russia and its impact on infrastructure and economic stability, achieving such a reduction by 2028 is uncertain.

This is a significant technological challenge due to several factors:\n\n1. **Current Technology**: As of 2023, most spacecraft rely on chemical propulsion, which is not renewable. While there have been advancements in electric propulsion (like ion thrusters), these are typically used in conjunction with traditional chemical rockets for initial launch due to their lower thrust.\n\n2. **Renewable Energy Sources**: For a spacecraft to be powered entirely by renewable energy, it would need to use sources such as solar, wind, or biofuels. Solar power is the most feasible for space applications, as it is already used to power satellites and space stations. However, using solar power for launch is not currently viable due to the energy density required for lift-off.\n\n3. **Development Timeline**: The timeline from October 2024 to January 2028 is relatively short for the development and testing of such a novel propulsion system. While companies like SpaceX are known for rapid innovation, developing a fully renewable launch system would require significant breakthroughs in energy storage and propulsion technology.\n\n4. **Industry Trends**: The space industry is increasingly focused on sustainability, but the focus has been more on reducing emissions and improving efficiency rather than entirely renewable launches. Companies are investing in reusable rockets and exploring alternative fuels, but a fully renewable launch system remains speculative.\n\n5. **Verification Requirement**: The resolution of this question also requires independent verification by a space agency or authoritative body, which adds an additional layer of scrutiny and validation that could delay or complicate the process.\n\nGiven these challenges, while it is not impossible, it is highly unlikely that a private company will achieve a fully renewable energy-powered spacecraft launch by the given date.\n\nProbability: 0.05"}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "f70a8d14-a726-43e1-96af-3d276fb2e66e", "title": "Will Elon Musk host or co-host Saturday Night Live (SNL) again before January 1, 2028?", "body": "This question will be resolved as 'Yes' if Elon Musk hosts or co-hosts an episode of Saturday Night Live (SNL) between October 1, 2024, and January 1, 2028.

While Sweden may have the capability, the decision would depend on political will, economic considerations, and alignment with national priorities.\n\n4. **Time Frame**: The time frame from October 2024 to January 2028 provides over three years for Sweden to potentially launch such a program. This is a reasonable period for planning, securing funding, and initiating a research program if there is interest and commitment from the government and scientific community.\n\n5. **Official Confirmation and Reporting**: For the question to resolve as \"Yes,\" the program's launch must be officially confirmed and reported by major news outlets. This adds an additional layer of complexity, as the program must not only be initiated but also gain sufficient international attention.\n\nGiven these factors, while there is a plausible scenario where Sweden could launch a nuclear fusion research program, it is not guaranteed.

Several factors influence this probability: 1. Political Will and Policy Changes: The Brazilian government's stance on environmental policies significantly impacts deforestation rates. If the government enacts stricter environmental policies or enforcement measures, it could lead to a reduction in deforestation. The current administration under President Lula da Silva, elected in 2022, has shown a commitment to environmental protection, which could positively influence the reduction in deforestation rates. 2. International Pressure and Agreements: Brazil is under international pressure to reduce deforestation, especially given global climate change concerns. International agreements or incentives, such as funding from the Amazon Fund or commitments from COP conferences, could encourage Brazil to reduce deforestation. 3. Economic Factors: Economic incentives for deforestation, such as agriculture and cattle ranching, are strong. Any economic downturns or shifts in global commodity prices could impact deforestation rates. 4. Technological and Monitoring Improvements: Advances in satellite monitoring and data collection can help improve enforcement and reduce illegal deforestation activities. 5. Historical Trends: Historically, deforestation rates have fluctuated based on the above factors. There have been periods of significant reduction followed by increases, depending on policy and economic conditions. Given these factors, while there is a reasonable chance for a reduction in deforestation rates due to political and international pressures, the economic incentives for deforestation remain strong.

However, its penetration into mainstream media as a central theme is still limited. While there have been some documentaries and minor storylines in TV series, it hasn't yet become a prevalent theme in major productions. 2. **Historical Precedent**: Historically, science and technology themes have occasionally been successful in winning major awards, but they often need to be paired with strong storytelling and character development to appeal to a broader audience. Movies like \"The Theory of Everything\" and \"The Imitation Game,\" which dealt with complex scientific subjects, have won Oscars, but they were heavily focused on the human stories behind the science. 3. **Industry Interest and Investment**: There is growing interest in science fiction and technology-driven narratives, as seen by the success of series like \"Black Mirror\" and movies like \"Ex Machina.\" However, quantum computing is a complex subject that may be challenging to translate into compelling narratives without significant creative investment. 4. **Upcoming Productions**: As of now, there are no widely publicized major film or TV projects centered on quantum computing that are in the pipeline. This reduces the likelihood of such a project being developed, produced, and winning an award within the next four years. 5. **Award Criteria and Trends**: Both the Oscars and Emmys tend to favor productions that are not only technically impressive but also resonate emotionally with audiences.

Congress typically focuses on issues with immediate policy implications or public interest. While scientific topics can become the focus of hearings, this usually happens when there is a clear connection to policy, funding, or national interest. Given the current trends, it seems somewhat unlikely that dark matter, despite its scientific importance, would be prioritized for a formal hearing unless there is a major breakthrough or public interest spike.\n\n2. **Percentage of Americans who believe in climate change denial falls below 10%**:\n   - Climate change is a highly polarizing topic in the US, but there is a gradual trend of increasing acceptance of climate science among the public. According to recent surveys, the percentage of climate change deniers has been decreasing over time, but it remains above 10% as of the latest data. For it to fall below 10% by 2028, significant shifts in public opinion would be necessary, potentially driven by increased climate impacts, education, and policy changes.

There might be ongoing research and clinical trials, but the development of new treatments typically takes several years, including the stages of discovery, preclinical testing, clinical trials, and regulatory review.\n\nThe FDA approval process is rigorous and can be lengthy, especially for entirely new classes of treatment like immunotherapy for radiation sickness. The process involves several phases of clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the treatment. Each phase can take several years, and the entire process can be further delayed by unforeseen challenges or the need for additional data.\n\nFurthermore, the urgency and funding for developing treatments for radiation sickness can impact the speed of development. Radiation sickness is a niche area compared to more common diseases, which might mean less investment and slower progress unless there is a significant driving factor, such as increased government interest or funding due to geopolitical concerns.\n\nConsidering these factors, while it is possible for a new treatment to be approved within the specified timeframe, it is not highly probable given the typical timelines for drug development and approval. Therefore, the probability of a new immunotherapy treatment for radiation sickness being approved by the FDA before January 1, 2028, is relatively low."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "67117961-e22c-4eec-b871-545c7c4914ab", "title": "Will the US Senate pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill before January 1, 2028?", "body": "This question will be resolved as 'Yes' if the US Senate passes a comprehensive immigration reform bill between October 1, 2024, and January 1, 2028.

The likelihood of a net gain in forest cover would require strong and sustained governmental and international efforts to enforce conservation policies.\n\n3. **International Pressure and Agreements**: International agreements and pressure can influence Brazil's environmental policies. Initiatives like the Paris Agreement and other global environmental commitments could encourage Brazil to take more robust actions to protect and restore the Amazon.\n\n4. **Technological and Monitoring Advances**: Advances in satellite monitoring and environmental technologies could improve enforcement of anti-deforestation laws and support reforestation efforts. However, the impact of these technologies depends on political will and adequate funding.\n\n5. **Reforestation and Conservation Projects**: There are ongoing reforestation projects and conservation efforts aimed at restoring parts of the Amazon. The success of these projects can contribute to a net gain, but they need to be substantial and widespread to counteract deforestation.\n\nGiven these factors, achieving a net gain in forest cover in the Amazon by 2028 would require significant policy shifts, effective enforcement, and successful implementation of conservation projects.

As of the latest data, there has been no strong indication from the Russian government that it plans to phase out coal entirely in the near future. The country's energy strategy has traditionally focused on maintaining energy security and leveraging its vast natural resources, including coal.\n\n2. **Economic Considerations**: The Russian economy benefits significantly from coal production and exports. Implementing a nationwide ban on coal-fired power plants could have substantial economic repercussions, potentially affecting jobs and revenue from coal-dependent regions and industries. This economic reliance makes a rapid transition away from coal less likely without substantial economic incentives or alternatives.\n\n3. **International Environmental Commitments**: While Russia is a signatory to the Paris Agreement, its commitments have been relatively modest compared to other countries. Russia has shown some interest in renewable energy, but the pace of transition has been slow. There is no strong external pressure or binding commitment that would necessitate a nationwide coal ban by 2028.\n\n4. **Political Climate**: The political climate in Russia tends to prioritize stability and control over rapid environmental reforms. Major policy shifts, especially those that could disrupt the economy or energy sector, are likely to face significant political resistance unless there is a compelling strategic advantage or necessity.\n\nGiven these factors, while there could be regional or sectoral shifts towards cleaner energy, a nationwide ban on coal-fired power plants by 2028 appears unlikely.

Given the timeframe of over three years, there is a reasonable chance that a national issue could arise that prompts a referendum.\n\nNorway, on the other hand, has a less frequent history of referendums. The most notable was the referendums on joining the European Union, held in 1972 and 1994. However, Norway's political landscape is stable, and the use of referendums is not a common practice. Still, political dynamics can change, and unforeseen issues could potentially lead to a referendum.\n\nConsidering both countries, the likelihood of at least one referendum occurring in the given timeframe is moderate. Australia's history and potential for political issues that require public voting increase the probability. Norway's less frequent use of referendums slightly lowers the probability, but does not negate the possibility entirely."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "fefcf703-bac8-4a69-afa7-b959970f1cf8", "title": "Will a peer-reviewed study confirm the presence of a novel microorganism capable of degrading plastic in marine environments by January 1, 2028?", "body": "This question will be resolved as 'Yes' if, between October 1, 2024, and January 1, 2028, a peer-reviewed study is published confirming the discovery of a novel microorganism capable of degrading plastic in marine environments.

Furthermore, international treaties like the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the active monitoring by organizations such as the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) work towards preventing the use of chemical weapons globally.\n\nHowever, there are still risks due to geopolitical tensions, terrorism, and the potential for non-state actors to acquire chemical weapons. Some G20 countries are involved in conflicts or tensions where the use of chemical weapons might be considered by rogue actors or terrorist groups. Despite these risks, the probability remains low due to the deterrent effect of international condemnation and the severe consequences for any state or group using chemical weapons.\n\nOverall, while the risk is not zero, the combination of strong international norms, security measures, and the historical rarity of such attacks in G20 countries suggests a low probability of a chemical weapon attack occurring in a G20 country by the specified date."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "9937b0ca-cb1d-4683-aea3-30d1f7b05195", "title": "Will Mexico announce the construction of a new nuclear power plant before January 1, 2028?", "body": "This question will be resolved as 'Yes' if the government of Mexico officially announces the construction of a new nuclear power plant between October 1, 2024, and January 1, 2028.

Current Trends and Historical Context: Historically, deforestation in the Amazon has fluctuated due to various political, economic, and environmental factors. Under President Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022), deforestation rates increased due to policies favoring agricultural expansion and reduced environmental enforcement. However, the election of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who took office in 2023, brought renewed commitments to environmental protection, including pledges to reduce deforestation. 2. Policy and Enforcement: Lula's administration has shown a strong commitment to environmental issues, reinstating and strengthening agencies like IBAMA and INPE, which are crucial for monitoring and enforcing deforestation laws. Increased funding and international cooperation, such as with the Amazon Fund, could bolster these efforts. 3. International Pressure and Agreements: Brazil faces significant international pressure to curb deforestation, particularly from European countries and the United States. International agreements or incentives, such as carbon credits or trade agreements conditioned on environmental performance, could motivate Brazil to achieve these reductions. 4. Technological and Scientific Advances: Advances in satellite monitoring and data analysis can improve the detection and prevention of illegal deforestation activities, potentially aiding in achieving reduction targets. 5. Challenges and Uncertainties: Despite these positive factors, challenges remain, such as illegal logging, land grabbing, and the economic interests of agribusiness. Additionally, political changes or economic downturns could shift priorities away from environmental protection.
