Past Performance and Popularity: Donald Trump has been a significant figure in American politics since his presidential campaign in 2016. Despite losing the 2020 election, he retains a substantial base of support within the Republican Party. His popularity among certain segments of the party faithful is a strong factor in his favor. 2. Current Political Climate: The political landscape in the United States is highly polarized. Trump's ability to galvanize his base and create controversy can be both a blessing and a curse. While it keeps him in the public eye and solidifies his support among loyalists, it also alienates potential allies and energizes his opposition. 3. Potential Opponents: The field of potential Republican nominees for the 2024 election includes several notable figures, some of whom, like Ron DeSantis, have been gaining momentum and could pose a significant challenge to Trump. However, Trump's name recognition and his established base of support give him an initial advantage over many of these contenders. 4. Nomination Process: The Republican National Convention's delegate selection process is crucial. Trump has shown in the past that he can navigate this process effectively, leveraging his popularity and political maneuvering to secure delegates. However, any missteps or significant opposition could complicate his path to the nomination. 5. Legal and Personal Challenges: As of my last update, Trump faces several legal challenges, including investigations and lawsuits, which could potentially impact his candidacy. While these have not seemed to diminish his support significantly in the past, they introduce elements of uncertainty and could affect his ability to campaign effectively. Given these considerations, while there are certainly factors that could derail his candidacy, Donald Trump's established base of support, his proven ability to navigate the Republican nomination process, and his significant name recognition make him a strong contender for the 2024 Republican nomination."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "0cbe69a6-904f-49bb-8fad-353960bbfdcd", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, and (b) Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) As of July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

Incumbent presidents typically have a strong advantage in terms of name recognition, fundraising capabilities, and party support, which makes it unlikely for them to withdraw unless faced with extraordinary circumstances such as severe health issues or significant scandal. As of the last available information before the creation of this question, there was no widespread indication of such circumstances affecting President Biden to the extent that he would be forced or choose to drop out. However, the political landscape can change rapidly due to unforeseen events. Given these considerations, the probability of President Biden dropping out before July 20 would be considered low based on historical precedents and the absence of publicly known factors that would necessitate his withdrawal.

Current Political Standing: As of my last update, Mike Pence has maintained a relatively high profile since leaving office. He has been involved in various initiatives and has not ruled out a future run for the presidency. However, his popularity and influence within the party are not as pronounced as they were during his vice presidency, partly due to the changing dynamics within the Republican Party and the emergence of other prominent figures. 2. Potential Competitors: The field for the Republican nomination is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates potentially running. This includes, but is not limited to, Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and possibly others who may emerge as the election draws closer. The presence of Donald Trump, in particular, could significantly impact Pence's chances, given Trump's strong base within the party and his influence over a substantial segment of Republican voters. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has been undergoing significant internal shifts, with a growing divide between traditional conservatives and those more aligned with Trump's brand of populism. Pence, while a conservative, has sometimes found himself caught between these factions, which could affect his ability to build a broad coalition of support within the party. 4. Historical Context: Historically, former vice presidents have had mixed success in their own presidential bids. Pence's legacy is closely tied to the Trump administration, which could be both a boon and a bane, depending on how Trump's presidency is viewed by Republican voters and the broader electorate by the time of the 2024 election. Given these considerations, while Mike Pence has a plausible path to the nomination, especially if he can navigate the party dynamics effectively and if other factors (like a decision by Trump not to run) fall in his favor, the competition and current party landscape present significant challenges."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "28f359ea-6a53-43b5-a1de-cbd7d543ce6a", "title": "Will Nikki Haley be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Nikki Haley is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Background and Experience: Nikki Haley has significant political experience, having served as the Governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017 and as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations from 2017 to 2018 under President Donald Trump. Her background positions her as a strong candidate within the Republican Party. 2. Republican Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has shown a tendency to nominate candidates who are either establishment figures or have managed to garner significant populist support, as seen with the nominations of Mitt Romney in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016. Haley's experience and her ability to appeal to both establishment and some populist elements within the party could work in her favor. 3. Competition: The field of potential Republican candidates for 2024 could be crowded, with figures like Donald Trump (if he decides to run again), Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis, and others potentially vying for the nomination. The competition will be fierce, and Haley will need to distinguish herself significantly to secure the nomination. 4. Fundraising and Support: The ability to raise funds and secure endorsements from key figures within the party will be crucial. Haley has shown an ability to fundraise effectively in the past, but the landscape for 2024 is still unfolding. 5. Public Perception and Polls: Early polls for the 2024 Republican nomination have shown varying levels of support for Haley, but these polls are highly subject to change as the election season progresses and more candidates officially enter the race.

The INC, on the other hand, has struggled to regain its footing. 2.

However, achieving and maintaining such unity has been a challenge for these parties. 3. Economic Factors: The state of the economy, including issues like unemployment, inflation, and growth, will play a crucial role in shaping public opinion. The INC could capitalize on economic discontent if the BJP is perceived as failing to address these issues effectively. 4. Regional Dynamics: The performance of regional parties and their alliances will also influence the outcome. The INC's ability to form strategic alliances could enhance its chances. 5.

The party has been in power since 2014 and has maintained a strong political presence across the country. 2. Past Election Performance: In the 2019 general elections, the BJP, along with its allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), secured a significant majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. This victory marked the BJP's second consecutive term in office, underscoring its political dominance. 3. Opposition Parties: The main opposition party, the Indian National Congress (INC), has faced several challenges, including leadership issues and internal conflicts, which have weakened its position against the BJP. Other regional parties, while strong in their respective states, often have limited national appeal or are part of the NDA, supporting the BJP. 4. Public Perception and Policies: The BJP's policies and governance, including its handling of the economy, national security, and social issues, have received mixed responses. However, the party has managed to maintain a significant level of public support, partly due to the popularity of Prime Minister Modi. 5. Election Campaigning and Strategies: The BJP is known for its robust election machinery and effective campaign strategies, which have contributed to its success in past elections. The party's ability to adapt to changing political scenarios and connect with voters through various channels, including social media, has been a key factor in its electoral victories. 6. Regional and State Elections: Results from recent state elections and by-elections have shown that while the BJP faces challenges in some regions, it remains a dominant force in many parts of the country.

In the Indian political system, it is common for parties to form coalitions to achieve a majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. For both the INC and BJP to form the government, they would likely need to be part of a coalition or have a significant number of seats themselves. Given the competitive nature of Indian politics and the presence of numerous regional parties that can influence the outcome, predicting the exact composition of the next government is challenging.

Historically, the United States has been one of the top-performing countries at the Olympics, both in terms of total medals and gold medals won. However, the number of gold medals versus silver medals can vary significantly from one Olympics to another. Factors such as changes in team composition, new sports or events being added to the Olympic program, and the performance of athletes from other countries can all impact the distribution of medals. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the United States won 113 medals in total, with 39 of them being gold and 41 silver. This indicates a very close margin between gold and silver medals. However, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and the dynamics of sports and athletes' performance can change significantly over a four-year period. Given the information available up to my last update in 2023, there are no specific indicators that would strongly suggest a significant shift in the balance between gold and silver medals for the USA at the Paris 2024 Olympics. The performance of athletes, the strength of the competition, and various external factors (such as rule changes or the introduction of new events) can all influence the outcome. Without specific, up-to-date information on the current team composition, athlete performance, and any strategic or training improvements the US Olympic team might be implementing, it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, based on historical trends and the general continuity of strong performance by the US team, one might lean slightly towards the possibility of the US winning more gold medals than silver, but with a significant degree of uncertainty.

Historical Precedent: Looking at previous Olympics, it's not uncommon for a few countries to win their first gold medals. For instance, at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 3 countries won their first-ever gold medals. 2. New Sports and Events: The 2024 Paris Olympics will include new sports and events, such as breakdancing, which might open up opportunities for countries that have strengths in these areas but haven't traditionally performed well in Olympic sports. 3. Globalization and Development of Sports: There's a trend towards more countries investing in sports development programs, which increases the likelihood of new countries winning medals. 4. Number of Participating Countries: With over 200 countries participating in the Olympics, the pool of potential first-time gold medal winners is large. However, winning a gold medal is an exceptional achievement that requires a combination of talent, resources, and luck. For a country to win its first gold, it needs athletes who not only meet the Olympic qualification standards but can also outperform competitors from countries with established Olympic success records. Given these considerations, while it's plausible that several countries could win their first gold medals, the number reaching five or more seems optimistic but not impossible. Therefore, considering the balance between the opportunities for new countries to shine and the competitive nature of the Olympics, I would estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal at the 2024 Olympics as follows:"}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "9423885f-b968-449e-be91-8510af4e1f5f", "title": "Will at least 5 countries win their first Olympic medal and their first gold medal at the 2024 Games?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if both of the following occur: (a) 5 or more countries win their first-ever Olympic medal at the Paris Olympics, and (b) 5 or more countries win their first-ever Olympic gold medal at the Paris Olympics, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).", "resolution_date": "2024-08-11T18:20:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-27T18:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.35, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "The above analysis suggests that while there are favorable conditions for new countries to win their first Olympic medals and gold medals, achieving both criteria specified in the question presents a challenging threshold."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current Political Standing: As of my last update, Glenn Youngkin is known for winning the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, a significant victory for Republicans in a state that had been trending Democratic. This victory raised his national profile and demonstrated his ability to win in a competitive environment. However, the national stage for a presidential election is vastly different, and his relatively recent entry into high-level politics might be seen as a lack of experience compared to other potential candidates. 2. Field of Potential Candidates: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 presidential election is broad and includes figures with significant national profiles, such as former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and several other governors and senators. The competition is fierce, and many of these individuals have more established national campaigns and greater name recognition than Youngkin. 3. Dynamics of the Republican National Convention: The nomination process at the Republican National Convention is complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including delegate counts from primary elections and caucuses, party politics, and negotiations among delegates. A candidate needs to win the support of a majority of the delegates to secure the nomination. While Youngkin might have support from certain factions within the party, particularly those who value his ability to win in a swing state, it's a challenging task to secure the majority needed without a significant national campaign and broad appeal within the party. Considering these factors, while Glenn Youngkin has shown political prowess and has potential for future national roles, the competition for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination is intense, and his relatively recent rise to prominence and lack of a broad national campaign infrastructure make it challenging for him to secure the nomination."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "4cbd4558-b5b7-453d-aec5-f4b6061b3294", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Firstly, the Republican Party's nomination process typically selects one candidate for the presidency and another for the vice presidency. The question implies a scenario where Youngkin and Trump would be part of the ticket, presumably with one as the presidential nominee and the other as the vice-presidential nominee. As of my last update, Donald Trump has been a dominant figure in the Republican Party, having been the party's nominee in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. His influence within the party remains significant, and there have been indications that he may seek the presidency again in 2024. Glenn Youngkin, on the other hand, is known for winning the governorship of Virginia in 2021, a state that had trended Democratic in recent years. His victory was seen as a significant upset and potentially indicative of a path forward for Republicans in moderate or swing states. However, his national profile and whether he would be considered for a vice-presidential slot or even attempt a presidential run himself is less clear. The resolution of this question depends on the dynamics within the Republican Party leading up to the 2024 election, including primary elections and the Republican National Convention. Factors such as party unity, strategic considerations about who could best win the general election, and the personal ambitions of the individuals involved will all play a role. Given these considerations, predicting with certainty the outcome of the nomination process is challenging. However, the question specifically asks for a probability estimate, which requires considering the plausibility of the scenario described."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Understanding the Location: The coordinates given (48\u00b035'13.7\"N 37\u00b050'02.1\"E) point to Chasiv Yar, a location in Ukraine. This area has been a focal point in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, particularly in the context of the Donbas region, which has seen significant military action since 2014. 2. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) Map: The ISW map is a reliable source for tracking the conflict's territorial control dynamics. It categorizes areas based on who controls them, including categories for Russian advances, gains, and control, as well as Ukrainian gains and counteroffensives. 3. Assessing the Probability: To estimate the probability of Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, we need to consider the current state of the conflict, recent trends, and the strategic importance of the location. - Current State and Trends: As of the last available information in April 2024, the conflict in Ukraine has seen various phases of intensity and territorial control shifts. However, without specific recent data, we must rely on the broader context, which suggests a dynamic and often unpredictable situation on the ground. - Strategic Importance: Chasiv Yar's strategic importance could influence the likelihood of Russian efforts to control it. Locations with significant military or symbolic value are more likely to be contested. 4. Predictive Challenges: Predicting territorial control in a conflict zone is inherently challenging due to the numerous variables involved, including military strategies, international support, and the internal dynamics of the conflicting parties. Given these considerations and without access to real-time data on the current state of control in Chasiv Yar, making a precise prediction is challenging. However, considering the ongoing nature of the conflict and the strategic importance of locations within the Donbas region, it's reasonable to consider that both sides could potentially control the area at different times. Therefore, without current data indicating a clear advantage or recent trend favoring one side's control over Chasiv Yar, a more neutral stance might be appropriate, leaning slightly towards the status quo or recent trends if known. However, given the lack of specific recent information, a cautious approach is to not heavily favor one outcome over the other."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e0d8c71b-825c-4129-9c82-f048775e2410", "title": "[Metaculus] Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democra...nomination for President?", "body": "Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nResolves the same as the original on Metaculus.\n\n(https://www.metaculus.com/questions/question_embed/25755/?theme=dark)Resolution criteria\n\nThis question will resolve as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.\n\nTo qualify for a Yes resolution, the statement must be unambiguous and conclusive: it should leave no room for the possibility that Biden would accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nIf such a definitive statement is not made prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, this question will resolve as No.\n\nFine print and additional background information can be found on Metaculus.\n\nOnce the original resolves, its resolution will be applied to this market automatically.

Current Political Landscape: As of the last update in July 2024, the Democratic Party's primary season is presumably underway, with several candidates likely vying for the nomination. The field of candidates might include those mentioned (Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, Biden, etc.), though the specific lineup could change due to various factors, including candidate withdrawals or new entrants. 2. Historical Context of Debates: Historically, debates are a crucial part of the primary process, allowing candidates to present their policies and visions to a broad audience. They are particularly important in contested primaries where no single candidate has a clear majority or overwhelming support. The Democratic Party typically organizes multiple debates in the months leading up to the national convention to ensure that candidates have ample opportunity to engage with voters. 3. Candidate Dynamics: The decision to hold debates also depends on the dynamics between the candidates. If the race is highly contested, with multiple viable candidates, the party and media outlets are more likely to organize debates. Conversely, if one candidate has a significant lead, making the outcome of the primary seem predetermined, there might be less incentive for additional debates. 4. Scheduling and Logistics: Debates require significant planning, including securing a venue, arranging for moderators, and coordinating with the candidates' schedules. Given the resolution date of August 12, 2024, there is still time for at least one more debate to be organized and held before the Democratic National Convention, assuming the convention is scheduled for late August or early September, as is typical. Considering these factors, it seems likely that there will be another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention, especially if the primary remains contested. The party and media outlets have an interest in hosting debates to inform voters and to allow candidates to make their case for the nomination."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "0cdcc047-a3c0-48e5-b9b0-f2a9fdfe282d", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) 10 or more Democratic Senators call for Biden to drop out before July 20 (b) There is another Democratic party presidential debate?", "body": "(a) Resolution source: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/biden-drop-out-democrats.html\n\nIf at any point before midnight July 20 Central Time, it shows 10 or more Dem Senators, this market will resolve to yes.

Given that the resolution date is about a month after the creation date of the question, there is ample time for new polls to be conducted and for the model to update its predictions. An increase in odds could be driven by several factors, including but not limited to: 1. Strong Debate Performance: If Kamala Harris performs well in any debates that occur between the creation and resolution dates, this could positively impact her poll numbers. 2. Campaign Strategy Adjustments: Effective campaign strategy adjustments by Harris's team could lead to better poll performance. 3. Mistakes by Opponents: Mistakes or controversies surrounding her opponents could shift public opinion in her favor. 4. Endorsements: High-profile endorsements could boost her visibility and appeal to voters. However, predicting an increase in odds also involves considering the potential for negative factors, such as mistakes by Harris herself or successful strategies by her opponents, which could decrease her odds. Given the relatively short timeframe (about a week) specified in the question and the inherent unpredictability of political campaigns, making a precise prediction is challenging.

This tension can escalate into military action, especially given the backdrop of Iran's nuclear program, which Israel views as an existential threat. 3.

Iran, on the other hand, has been strengthening its military capabilities, including its missile program. 4. International Pressure and Diplomacy: The international community's efforts to reduce tensions and address the Iran nuclear issue through diplomacy (e.g., the JCPOA) could influence Israel's decision-making. However, the effectiveness of these efforts can vary, and their impact on Israel's actions is uncertain. 5. Time Frame: The time frame before May 1, 2024, is relatively short, which could influence the likelihood of an attack, considering the planning and preparation required for such operations.

Current Standing and Recognition: As of my last update, Vivek Ramaswamy is known as an entrepreneur and author, particularly for his book 'Woke, Inc.' which critiques corporate America's approach to social justice issues. While he has gained some prominence for his views, his national recognition and political experience might not be as extensive as other potential candidates. 2. Competitive Landscape: The field for the Republican nomination can be quite crowded, potentially including well-known figures like former President Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and others. These individuals have significant political experience and a broad base of support within the party, which presents a considerable challenge for Ramaswamy. 3. Republican National Convention Dynamics: The nomination process at the convention is influenced by delegate counts from primaries and caucuses, as well as the political maneuvering and coalition-building among party leaders and delegates. A candidate without a strong showing in the primaries or without significant support from party insiders faces an uphill battle. Given these considerations, while Vivek Ramaswamy has a unique voice and perspective that resonates with some segments of the Republican base, the competition for the nomination includes figures with more established political careers and broader support bases.

This competition makes it challenging for any single candidate, including Will Hurd, to secure the nomination. 2. Will Hurd's Background and Appeal: Will Hurd is a former CIA officer and served as a U.S. Representative from Texas's 23rd congressional district. While he has a strong background in national security and has been a moderate voice within the Republican Party, his name recognition and appeal at a national level compared to other candidates might be limited. 3. Primary Election Dynamics: The Republican primary process involves a series of state-by-state contests where delegates are awarded based on vote outcomes. The candidate who secures the majority of delegates becomes the nominee. This process can be unpredictable, with outcomes influenced by factors such as voter turnout, debate performances, and campaign strategies. 4. Fundraising and Campaign Infrastructure: A successful presidential campaign requires substantial fundraising and a robust campaign infrastructure. While Will Hurd has shown ability in his congressional races, scaling to a national campaign requires significant resources and a broad network of supporters.

However, the Republican field is or was expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates, including Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, and possibly others.

Event (b) would depend on Hurd's ability to outperform other potentially stronger candidates in the Republican primaries and gain the majority support of the delegates at the convention.

As of my last update, there was no public indication that President Biden's health or tenure is in immediate jeopardy to the extent that Vice President Harris would take over within such a specific timeframe. 2. Temporary Transfer of Power: It's also possible for a Vice President to become Acting President if the President undergoes a medical procedure that requires anesthesia, thus temporarily transferring power. However, such transfers are usually brief and not indicative of a permanent change. 3. Impeachment and Removal: Another, though highly improbable within the given timeframe, scenario is the impeachment and removal of President Biden. The process of impeachment and subsequent removal from office is lengthy and complex, involving both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Given the political makeup of Congress and the time required for such proceedings, this scenario is extremely unlikely to occur before July 26, 2024. 4.

The current record of 9.63s, set by Usain Bolt in 2012, has stood for over a decade, indicating that further improvements are becoming increasingly difficult. 2. Current Performance Levels: As of the last available data before the creation of this question, the world's top sprinters have been performing close to but not significantly under the 9.63s mark. The world leader in 2023, for example, might have run a time close to this record but not broken it. 3. Athlete Development and Innovation: Advances in training methods, technology (such as shoe technology), and athlete development programs continue to push the boundaries of human performance. However, these advancements are incremental and often take years to result in significant record improvements. 4. Competition Environment: The Paris Summer Olympics will provide a high-level competition environment that often pushes athletes to achieve personal bests and, occasionally, world records. The atmosphere, combined with the peak physical condition of athletes during the Olympics, increases the likelihood of exceptional performances. Considering these factors, while it's possible for the Olympic record to be broken given the right combination of athlete talent, training, and competition environment, the long-standing nature of the current record and the incremental nature of improvements in sprinting suggest that a new record is not highly probable but still within the realm of possibility."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "ce567079-fa40-4146-a090-02253134bc3d", "title": "Will Individual Neutral Athletes Win \u226515 Gold Medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Individual Neutral Athletes collectively win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

First, it's essential to note that this market's resolution depends on the initial nomination, and any changes after that will not affect the outcome. Given that the market was created in April 2023 and is set to resolve by August 2024, it suggests that the nomination process is likely to occur within this timeframe, possibly as part of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Kamala Harris has been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, serving as a U.S. Senator from California and, more notably, as the Vice President of the United States under President Joe Biden since 2021. Her selection as VP in the 2020 election marked a historic moment, and she is the first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American to hold the office. Given her current position as Vice President and her political profile, there is a strong likelihood that she would be nominated again for the VP position in the 2024 election, assuming President Biden seeks re-election and maintains her as his running mate. However, without explicit confirmation from the Democratic Party or President Biden regarding their intentions for the 2024 election, we cannot assign a probability of 1. There are scenarios, though less likely, where Kamala Harris might not be the VP nominee, such as if she decides not to run again or if there is a change in the presidential candidate. However, as of the last available information and considering her current role and political standing, these scenarios seem less probable.

Notable swimmers like Michael Phelps have set records for the most gold medals won by an individual in Olympic history. This suggests that swimming is a sport where athletes can compete in multiple events, increasing their chances of winning more medals. 2. Number of Events: Swimming includes a wide range of events, from sprint distances like the 50m freestyle to endurance events like the 1500m freestyle, as well as relays and individual medleys. This variety allows talented swimmers to compete in multiple events, increasing their potential medal count. 3. Global Competition: The global competition in swimming is fierce, but certain countries like the United States, Australia, and Great Britain have traditionally dominated the sport. The depth of talent in these countries means that their top swimmers often have a strong support team and are more likely to win multiple medals. 4. Emerging Talent: Each Olympic cycle brings new talent to the forefront. Young swimmers who have been performing well in junior championships and world championships could emerge as top medal winners in Paris. 5. Competition from Other Sports: While swimmers have a historical advantage in terms of the number of medals they can win, athletes from other sports like gymnastics, track and field, and cycling also have the potential to win multiple gold medals. The competition for the title of most gold medals won is therefore not exclusive to swimming. Considering these factors, it seems likely that a swimmer could win the most gold medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics, given the sport's history, the number of events available, and the emergence of new talent.

(a) A swimmer wins the most gold medals: Historically, swimming has been one of the sports with the highest number of gold medals won by an individual at the Olympics. Swimmers like Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz, and Katie Ledecky have all won multiple gold medals in a single Olympics. Given the number of events in swimming and the dominance of top swimmers, it's reasonable to estimate that a swimmer has a high chance of winning the most gold medals. However, other sports like track and field, gymnastics, and cycling also have athletes who can win multiple gold medals. Let's conservatively estimate the probability of a swimmer winning the most gold medals as 0.6. (b) The same nation wins more than one women's team sport: There are eight women's team sports at the Olympics, and several nations have strong teams across multiple sports. For example, the United States has a strong presence in sports like basketball, soccer, and volleyball. China, Australia, and European nations like Great Britain, Germany, and France also have competitive teams in various sports. Given the competition and the spread of talent across nations, it's likely that at least one nation will win more than one gold medal in women's team sports. Let's estimate the probability of this event as 0.7. Now, to estimate the probability of both events occurring, we need to multiply the individual probabilities: Probability = 0.6 (swimmer wins the most gold medals) \u00d7 0.7 (same nation wins more than one women's team sport) = 0.42. Based on historical trends and the competitive landscape of the Olympics, a swimmer has a high chance of winning the most gold medals, and it's likely that at least one nation will win more than one gold medal in women's team sports.

Song and Artist Quality: The quality and appeal of the song and artist selected by Georgia for Eurovision 2024 are crucial.

Some years and semi-finals are more competitive than others, depending on the participating countries and their entries. Knowing which countries and songs Georgia will be competing against can help assess their relative chances. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical, cultural, and political factors. Countries often vote for their neighbors or countries with which they have cultural or historical ties. Georgia might benefit from votes from neighboring or culturally close countries, which could enhance their chances of qualifying. 5. EBU Rules and Changes: Any changes to the voting system, country participation, or rules by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) could affect the outcome. For instance, changes in how jury and public votes are weighted or the introduction of new voting mechanisms could impact Georgia's chances.

For event (a), we need to analyze the polling data and determine if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. Public opinion polls consistently show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, but every other Democrat hypothetically surveyed polls ahead or within the margin of error. This suggests that Trump may perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat. However, it's unclear if this trend will hold among Manifold respondents.

New sports offer opportunities for a wider range of countries to compete and potentially win medals, including their first gold medals. 4.

Historical Context: In previous presidential election cycles, debates among candidates of the same party have been common, serving as a platform for candidates to differentiate themselves and for voters to make informed decisions. Given this precedent, it's reasonable to expect debates to continue as a part of the electoral process. 2. Candidate Dynamics: The mention of specific potential nominees (Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, Biden, etc.) suggests there is already speculation about who might run. A competitive primary season with multiple viable candidates increases the likelihood of debates, as these events provide opportunities for lesser-known candidates to gain visibility and for all candidates to demonstrate their capabilities and policies. 3. Party Strategy: The Democratic Party has an interest in promoting a unified and strong front against Republican candidates. Debates can serve as a means to vet candidates, test their appeal, and prepare them for the general election. They also provide a platform for the party to showcase its policy initiatives and values. 4. Voter Engagement: Debates are an important tool for engaging voters and encouraging participation in the electoral process. By hosting debates, the Democratic Party can stimulate discussion, increase voter interest, and potentially boost turnout in the primaries and the general election. 5. Resolution and Timing: The resolution date is set just before the 2024 Democratic National Convention, which is when the party officially nominates its candidate for president. Given the strategic importance of debates in the nomination process, it's plausible that at least one debate would occur before this date to influence delegate decisions and public opinion. Considering these factors, it appears likely that there will be another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

Furthermore, in the current media landscape, the competition for breaking news is fierce, incentivizing outlets to be the first to report on significant events.

Firstly, the relationship between Israel and Iran has been marked by hostility and rivalry, with a significant escalation in tensions over the past few years. Israel has been vocal about its opposition to Iran's nuclear program and has taken covert actions to disrupt it. Iran, on the other hand, has threatened to retaliate against Israel for its actions. Secondly, recent developments in the region, such as the ongoing conflict in Syria and the increasing involvement of Iran in the region, have heightened tensions between the two countries. Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Syria targeting Iranian-backed forces, which has led to a significant escalation in tensions. Thirdly, Israel has a history of conducting covert operations and targeted killings, including within Iran. For example, in 2020, Israel was suspected of being behind the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. However, it's also important to consider the potential consequences of such an attack. A deadly attack by Israel within Iran could lead to a significant escalation in tensions, potentially drawing in other countries in the region. This could lead to a wider conflict, which would have severe consequences for regional and global stability.

Firstly, the media outlets listed (Associated Press News, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Reuters, and Washington Post) are all reputable and have extensive networks of sources and journalists covering political events. Given the significance of a sitting President dropping out of a re-election campaign, it's reasonable to assume that these outlets would have a high level of interest in breaking the story. Secondly, in the current media landscape, the speed at which news travels is incredibly fast. With the advent of social media, online news platforms, and 24-hour news cycles, the competition to break stories first is intense. This environment incentivizes media outlets to publish news as quickly as possible, often with unofficial confirmations from reliable sources before official announcements are made. However, the requirement for the story to be covered at least 6 hours in advance of the official announcement adds a layer of complexity. This timeframe suggests that the media outlet would need to have a solid, reliable source confirming the dropout decision with enough lead time to verify the information and prepare the story for publication. Given these considerations, it's plausible that a reliable media outlet could cover the story in advance, but the exact timing would depend heavily on the specifics of the situation, including the media outlet's sources, the Biden campaign's handling of the announcement, and the overall news environment at the time.

This suggests a specific disadvantage for Biden in head-to-head matchups against Trump compared to other Democratic candidates. 2.

If they are, we might expect their voting patterns to mirror those seen in public opinion polls.

The Specific 3% Margin: The resolution criteria hinge on a 3% or more difference in Trump's favor when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat. This margin is relatively modest but still significant in the context of polling, where margins of error are often around 3-4%. Given these considerations, here's the reasoning: - If Manifold respondents mirror the general public's opinions as seen in traditional polls, there's a basis to believe Trump might perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat, given Biden's consistent underperformance in head-to-head polls against Trump. - However, the specific behavior and demographics of Manifold respondents could introduce variables that don't exist in general public polling, potentially altering the outcome. - The requirement for a 3% margin in favor of Trump when facing Biden introduces a specific, quantifiable threshold that must be met for the question to resolve as 'yes.'

After years of not qualifying for the final, the country saw a resurgence in success, winning in 2019 with Duncan Laurence's 'Arcade.' However, success in Eurovision can be cyclical, and past performance does not guarantee future results. 2. Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the performing artist is crucial. A catchy, well-produced song performed by a talented artist can significantly increase a country's chances of qualifying. Without knowing the specific entry for 2024, it's challenging to assess this factor accurately. 3. Competition: The level of competition in the semi-finals is another critical factor. Some years see a higher concentration of strong entries in one semi-final over the other. The draw for the semi-finals and the running order can also impact a country's chances. 4. Voting Patterns: Voting in Eurovision is influenced by a mix of factors, including song quality, performance, and geopolitical considerations. The Netherlands, being a Western European country, might face challenges in garnering votes from Eastern European countries, which often vote for their regional neighbors. However, the Netherlands can rely on a certain level of support from its own neighbors and countries with similar cultural backgrounds. 5. Jury vs. Public Vote: The outcome is determined by a combination of jury and public voting. The Netherlands would need to appeal to both to ensure qualification. A strong performance that is both vocally impressive and visually engaging can sway the jury, while a catchy, memorable song can secure public votes. Considering these factors, the Netherlands faces a degree of uncertainty, especially without knowing the specifics of their entry for 2024. However, given the country's recent efforts to send competitive entries and the unpredictable nature of Eurovision, there's a reasonable chance they could qualify."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "dda30cbb-3f2e-47e4-9b2d-4a565ee86c31", "title": "Will Croatia qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Croatia participates in a Semi-final and is then officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

His popularity and influence within the party have waned since his failed presidential bid in 2016. 2. Competition: The Republican field for the 2024 presidential election is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates potentially running. These include former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and possibly several other governors, senators, and prominent party figures. Christie would need to outcompete these individuals to secure the nomination. 3. Fundraising and Support: Christie's ability to raise funds and garner significant party and grassroots support will be crucial. As of now, there's little indication that he has a strong national fundraising network or broad support base compared to other potential candidates. 4. Public Perception and Polls: Current polls (as of 2023) do not show Christie as a leading candidate for the Republican nomination. Public perception of Christie has been mixed, particularly outside of New Jersey, and he has struggled to gain widespread national appeal. 5. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has undergone significant changes since Christie's last presidential bid, with a notable shift towards more populist and conservative stances. Christie's more moderate positions on some issues could make it challenging for him to win over the party's base. Considering these factors, while it's impossible to predict with certainty, the likelihood of Chris Christie securing the Republican nomination for the 2024 US Presidential Election appears low.

Past Performance: Poland has had mixed results in Eurovision. After a series of non-qualifications, they returned to the contest in 2014 and have since qualified for the final a few times, most notably with Edyta G\u00f3rniak's high placing in 1994 and more recent qualifications. However, consistency has been an issue. 2. Current Trends: Eurovision trends can shift rapidly, but as of the last few contests, there's been a noticeable lean towards more contemporary and experimental acts, as well as a strong showing for traditional Eurovision fare like powerful ballads and catchy pop. Poland's choice of act and song will be crucial in determining how well they fit into the current musical landscape of the contest. 3. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting is notoriously unpredictable, but certain patterns emerge. Neighborhood voting (countries voting for their geographical neighbors) can play a role, as can diaspora voting. Poland's position in Central Europe might give it some advantages in terms of neighborly votes, but it's also in a competitive region with other strong contenders. 4. Format or Rule Changes: Any changes to the contest format, such as alterations in how the semi-finals are arranged or how voting is conducted, could impact Poland's chances. However, as of the last available information, no significant changes have been announced that would drastically alter the qualification process. Considering these factors, Poland's qualification is not a certainty but is within the realm of possibility, especially if they select a strong and contemporary act that resonates with both the jury and the public.

Political Experience and Popularity: Donald Trump Jr. has been involved in politics, primarily through his support of his father, former President Donald Trump. He has written books, made public appearances, and engaged in political commentary, which has helped him build a following among conservative voters. However, his direct political experience is limited compared to other potential candidates. 2. Potential Competition: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could be crowded, with several experienced politicians and figures within the party potentially running. These include former President Donald Trump himself, former Vice President Mike Pence, governors like Ron DeSantis of Florida, and senators like Ted Cruz of Texas. Each of these candidates has a significant base of support and more direct political experience than Donald Trump Jr. 3. Current Political Climate: The Republican Party is currently navigating its post-Trump presidency identity. While Donald Trump remains a dominant figure within the party, there is a growing faction looking to move beyond him. Donald Trump Jr. would likely rely heavily on his father's endorsement and support, which could be a double-edged sword, given the divisive nature of the elder Trump's presidency. 4. Historical Precedents: It's rare for a major party to nominate someone with as little direct political experience as Donald Trump Jr. for the presidency. While his father was an exception, this was under unique circumstances, and it's uncertain whether the party would be willing to take a similar risk again.

The level of competition from these sports can impact the likelihood of a swimmer winning the most gold medals. 4. Current Talent Pool in Swimming: The current talent pool in swimming would also influence the outcome.

Taylor Swift's Acting Career: Taylor Swift is a renowned musician but has also made appearances in film and television. Her most notable roles include 'Valentine's Day' (2010), 'The Lorax' (2012), and 'Cats' (2019). This shows she is open to acting roles, albeit usually in smaller or voice-over capacities. 2. The Movie 'Deadpool and Wolverine': This movie is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and brings together two of the most popular characters from the X-Men comics. Given the nature of Deadpool's character, who frequently breaks the fourth wall and engages in meta-humor, it wouldn't be out of character for the film to include unexpected cameos. 3. The Role of Dazzler: The article from People.com speculates about Taylor Swift playing the role of Dazzler, a mutant with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams. While this is speculative, the character of Dazzler has a background that could potentially align with Swift's public persona, given Dazzler's origins as a disco singer and her subsequent career as a superhero. 4. Confirmation and Sources: The resolution criteria for this question allow for confirmation by independent sources, not solely relying on IMDB credits. This broadens the scope for verifying a potential cameo. Considering these points, while there's speculation and potential for Taylor Swift to appear in 'Deadpool and Wolverine,' possibly as Dazzler, there's no concrete confirmation available in the provided information. The speculation in the People.com article and the openness of both Swift to acting roles and the film's potential for unexpected cameos contribute to a positive inclination but do not offer a definitive answer. Given the absence of direct confirmation and relying on speculative information, a moderate probability seems appropriate.

Franchise Performance and Growth: The success of the 'Deadpool' franchise, especially the first film released in 2016, indicates a strong fan base and potential for significant box office performance. The addition of Wolverine, another highly popular character from the X-Men universe, could enhance the appeal and attract a broader audience. 2. Marketing and Hype: The level of marketing and hype surrounding 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could significantly impact its opening weekend. Given the popularity of both characters and the success of previous films, it's likely that the studio will invest heavily in promotional activities. 3. Cinematic Universe and Crossover Appeal: The film represents a crossover event within the X-Men cinematic universe, combining the narratives of two fan-favorite characters. This crossover appeal can attract viewers who are fans of either or both characters, potentially leading to a higher opening weekend. 4. Competition and Release Timing: The timing of the film's release and the competitive landscape of other movies debuting around the same period will also influence its opening weekend box office. A release during a less crowded period or one that faces less direct competition from other blockbuster films could favor a higher opening. 5. Inflation and Box Office Trends: Since the release of 'Deadpool' in 2016 and 'The Wolverine' in 2013, there has been inflation in ticket prices and potentially changes in viewer habits. These factors could contribute to a higher opening weekend for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' without necessarily indicating more tickets sold. Considering these factors, it seems plausible that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could have a strong opening weekend, potentially surpassing the combined openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine.' The combination of popular characters, likely significant marketing efforts, and the appeal of a crossover event within the X-Men universe are strong indicators of success. However, predicting box office performance involves a degree of uncertainty, including how well the film will be received by critics and audiences, the effectiveness of the marketing campaign, and external factors such as competition and economic conditions.

'Split' and 'Glass' both received favorable scores (B+ and B, respectively), indicating that he is capable of producing well-received films. However, his more recent films, 'Old' and 'Knock at the Cabin,' received lower scores (C+ and C, respectively), suggesting a decline in audience satisfaction. 2. **Trend Analysis**: If we look at the trend of CinemaScores for Shyamalan's films, there seems to be a decline in audience approval over his last few films. This could indicate a pattern where his more recent works are not resonating as strongly with audiences. 3. **Film-Specific Factors**: The question mentions that 'Trap' has a 'great trailer,' which could imply positive initial impressions and potentially high expectations from the audience. However, the relationship between trailer reception and final CinemaScore is not always direct or reliable. 4. **External Factors**: CinemaScores can be influenced by a variety of external factors, including marketing campaigns, audience expectations, competition at the time of release, and cultural or social context. These factors are not mentioned in the provided context and could significantly impact the final CinemaScore. Given these considerations, while there is evidence to suggest that Shyamalan is capable of producing films that receive high CinemaScores, the recent trend and mixed reception of his latest works introduce uncertainty. The positive initial impression from the trailer could be a favorable sign, but it is not a definitive predictor of the final CinemaScore.

Re-election of Kimbal Musk: Kimbal Musk is Elon Musk's brother and a member of Tesla's board of directors. His re-election could be scrutinized based on governance concerns, such as independence and the concentration of family members on the board, which could influence ISS's recommendation. 4. Historical Context and ISS's Stance: Historically, ISS has taken a critical stance on issues related to executive compensation and board governance, especially when they perceive a lack of alignment with shareholder interests or when governance practices are deemed suboptimal. Given these points, it's reasonable to infer that ISS might advise against at least one of the two matters in question, considering their historical stance on executive compensation and governance issues. However, without specific details on the current compensation package or the exact governance concerns surrounding Kimbal Musk's re-election, it's challenging to predict with certainty. Therefore, considering ISS's role, historical stances, and the nature of the issues at hand, I would estimate a moderate to high likelihood of ISS advising against either Elon Musk's compensation package or Kimbal Musk's re-election."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "35b24ee9-e3e9-4103-aae9-950d9bd7be0d", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Will the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15?

Several factors suggest that this event is unlikely: 1. Historical Precedent: The 25th Amendment has been invoked a few times since its ratification in 1967, but Section 4 has never been used to declare a President incapacitated against their will. This lack of precedent suggests a high threshold for such action. 2. Political Implications: Invoking Section 4 would be a highly controversial and politically charged decision, especially in the context of the current polarized political environment. Such a move would likely face significant opposition and could have profound implications for the political landscape. 3.

Current Trend: As of the question's creation on July 9, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points, which falls within the specified range. This indicates a current advantage for Trump that is close to the target range. 2. Volatility of Polls: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological differences among polls. However, 538's polling average is designed to smooth out some of this volatility by aggregating multiple polls and adjusting for their quality, sample size, and partisan lean. 3. Time Frame: The question pertains to a specific date, July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the creation date of the question. Given the short time frame, drastic changes in public opinion are less likely, but not impossible, especially in the context of significant events or revelations. 4. Campaign Dynamics: The period leading up to a presidential election is characterized by intense campaigning, debates, and media scrutiny, all of which can influence polling numbers. However, predicting the exact impact of these factors on the polling average is challenging without specific details on upcoming events. 5. Historical Context: Historical data on polling averages show that while leads can fluctuate, a consistent lead (such as Trump's current lead) suggests a certain level of stability in public opinion, at least in the short term. Considering these factors, the probability that Trump's lead will remain within the specified range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) seems plausible but is subject to the inherent uncertainties of polling data and campaign dynamics. Given the current lead of 2.4 points and the general stability of aggregated polling averages over short periods, it's reasonable to believe there's a moderate chance Trump's lead will stay within this range. However, predicting polling averages with precision is inherently uncertain due to the factors mentioned above.

Historically, the United States has been dominant in basketball, with the men's team winning 16 Olympic gold medals, including the last four Olympics, and the women's team winning 9 Olympic gold medals, including the last seven Olympics. However, the competition has been getting stronger, and the US teams have faced challenges in recent international competitions. The current men's team has a talented roster, but they will face stiff competition from teams like Australia, Spain, and France, who have been improving their rosters and have a good mix of experience and young talent. The women's team, on the other hand, has a strong core of experienced players, but they will also face tough competition from teams like Australia, Canada, and China. Given the strength of the US teams and their historical dominance, it's likely that they will be among the top contenders for the gold medals. However, the competition is getting stronger, and there is always a risk of injury or an off-day that could affect their chances.

Condition 1: The Pandemic Agreement is approved at the May 2024 World Health Assembly. The Pandemic Agreement is a significant global health initiative, and its approval depends on various factors, including international cooperation, political will, and the effectiveness of the agreement's terms. While there might be challenges and disagreements among nations, the global community has shown a willingness to come together to address health crises, as seen in responses to past pandemics. However, without specific information on the current status of negotiations, the degree of support from key countries, or potential points of contention, it's difficult to provide a precise estimate. Given the complexity of international agreements and the need for consensus, a moderate level of optimism seems appropriate. Condition 2: OpenAI publicly commits to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle before July 1, 2024. OpenAI's commitment to such a principle would be a significant step forward in terms of transparency and accountability in AI development. The company has shown a willingness to engage in public discussions about AI ethics and safety, which could suggest a predisposition towards embracing principles like the one in question. However, the specific commitment to 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' requires a clear and public statement from the company or its leadership. Given the importance of this principle for ensuring open critique and improvement of AI systems, there might be internal discussions and considerations that could delay or affect the nature of such a commitment. Considering these factors, the likelihood of OpenAI making a satisfactory commitment before July 1, 2024, seems plausible but not guaranteed. Combining the Probabilities: Given the independence of these two events, we can multiply their probabilities to find the probability of both occurring. Let's assign a probability of 0.6 to the first condition (approval of the Pandemic Agreement) and 0.5 to the second condition (OpenAI's commitment to the principle). These values reflect cautious optimism based on the context provided. The probability of both events occurring would then be 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3. Reasoning: As explained above, considering the complexity of international agreements and the steps required for OpenAI to commit to the principle in question, a combined probability reflects the challenges in achieving both outcomes within the specified timeframe."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, Norway has a strong music industry and often sends high-quality entries, which increases their chances of qualification. The Eurovision Song Contest voting system is based on a combination of jury and public votes, with each country awarding points to their top 10 songs. To qualify for the Grand Final, Norway needs to be among the top 10 countries in their semi-final, either based on the combined jury and public vote or by receiving a wild card from the juries if they are outside the top 10 but high in the jury vote. Given the subjective nature of music preferences and the unpredictability of live performances, predicting Eurovision outcomes is inherently uncertain.

However, I don't have real-time access to the market's current data or any information about the market's recent trends. Given the lack of information, I will rely on general knowledge about online markets and trading platforms. It's common for online markets to experience fluctuations in user engagement, and the rate at which new traders join can be influenced by various factors such as marketing efforts, social media buzz, or changes in the market's rules or incentives. Without specific data, it's difficult to make an accurate prediction. However, considering that the market has already attracted some attention (as evidenced by the creation of this question), it's possible that it may continue to attract new traders.

These may include figures like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others who have been mentioned as possible contenders. The strength and viability of these challengers can impact Trump's chances. 3.

His political influence and popularity within the party have waxed and waned over the years, particularly following his involvement in the 2016 presidential election and subsequent legal issues. 2. Competitive Landscape: The Republican Party is expected to have a crowded field of potential candidates vying for the 2024 nomination. This includes figures who have maintained a higher national profile and possibly stronger grassroots support within the party, such as former President Donald Trump, if he decides to run again, and other prominent Republicans who have been more actively positioning themselves for a presidential bid. 3. Historical Context: Historically, Republican nominees have often been individuals who have either been prominent national figures within the party, have had significant electoral success, or have managed to consolidate support from various factions within the party. Christie's past electoral success in a traditionally Democratic state like New Jersey is notable, but his appeal to the broader Republican base, especially the more conservative elements, has been a challenge. Considering these factors, while Chris Christie has the political experience and could potentially appeal to certain segments of the Republican Party, the competitive landscape and his current standing within the party suggest that his chances of securing the nomination are relatively low compared to other potential candidates who may have stronger national profiles or more robust support within key factions of the party."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "36f100bf-ab96-4dae-9636-bd31f2d03200", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, and (b) Chris Christie be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's [national polling average for the 2024 presidential election](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/) as reported on the chart for the date of July 15, 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024.

Tennis Events at the Olympics: Tennis at the Olympics typically includes several events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. This gives athletes multiple opportunities to win medals. 2. Competition Format: In each event, athletes or teams compete in a tournament format, where losing a match typically results in elimination. The nature of tennis tournaments means that upsets can happen, but top-ranked players often have an advantage due to their skill level and experience. 3. Historical Precedent: Historically, it is not uncommon for top tennis players to compete in and win multiple events at the Olympics. For example, the Williams sisters (Serena and Venus) have won multiple gold medals in singles and doubles. However, winning more than one medal requires an athlete to perform exceptionally well across different events, which is challenging due to the physical demands of tennis and the high level of competition. 4. Athlete Participation: The likelihood of an athlete winning more than one medal also depends on who chooses to participate. Top players might focus on singles or doubles, depending on their strengths and preferences. If several top players decide to compete in both singles and doubles (or mixed doubles), the chances of someone winning multiple medals increase. 5. Injury and Fatigue: Tennis is physically demanding, and competing in multiple events increases the risk of injury or fatigue. This can affect an athlete's performance and reduce their chances of winning multiple medals. Considering these factors, while it is challenging for an athlete to win more than one medal in tennis at the Olympics, it is certainly possible, especially for top-ranked players who participate in multiple events.

While he has significant influence over conservative audiences, his background is more aligned with media and commentary rather than direct political involvement. This lack of direct political experience, especially in elected offices, could be a significant hurdle for a presidential nomination. The Republican Party typically nominates candidates with a strong political background, such as governors, senators, or members of the House of Representatives. For Carlson to be nominated, he would need to overcome this traditional preference and convince the party and its voters that his media background and influence are sufficient or advantageous for the presidency. Moreover, the field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 election could include several seasoned politicians with established track records and support bases within the party. The competition for the nomination would likely be intense, with candidates who have spent years or even decades building their political careers and networks within the party.

Suarez's ability to stand out and gain significant support in such a crowded field is a challenging task. 3. Selection Process: The Republican National Convention's process involves delegates from each state selecting the nominee. This process can be influenced by primary elections and caucuses, where candidates compete for votes and delegates. Suarez would need to perform well in these contests to have a chance at the nomination. 4.

His popularity within certain segments of the Republican base could be an advantage, but his lack of political experience might be seen as a drawback by party insiders and some voters. Francis Suarez, on the other hand, is a politician with experience, serving as the Mayor of Miami. His political background could make him a more traditional candidate for the nomination. However, his national recognition and appeal within the broader Republican Party might not be as widespread as Carlson's. The Republican Party's nomination process involves a complex interplay of factors including primary elections, caucuses, and the eventual selection by delegates at the Republican National Convention. The party's field of candidates for the 2024 election could be wide, potentially including other well-established politicians with strong backing within the party. Given these considerations, while both Tucker Carlson and Francis Suarez have their strengths, the likelihood of both being selected as nominees seems low due to the competitive nature of the nomination process and the diverse interests within the Republican Party.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update in 2023, the Republican field for the 2024 presidential election is wide open, with several potential candidates expressing interest or already having thrown their hats into the ring. The landscape can change rapidly based on various factors, including candidate popularity, fundraising capabilities, and how well candidates navigate the primary debates and state elections. 2. Chris Christie's Background and Popularity: Chris Christie, a former governor of New Jersey, has been a notable figure in the Republican Party. However, his popularity and influence have waxed and waned over the years, particularly following his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal and his subsequent fall from favor among some Republicans due to his criticisms of Donald Trump. 3. Primary Election Dynamics: The Republican primary process is complex, involving multiple states with different demographics, voting systems (caucus vs. primary), and delegate allocation rules. Success in the primaries often depends on a candidate's ability to build a broad coalition of support across different segments of the party and to perform well in key early states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. 4. Fundraising and Media Presence: A successful presidential campaign requires significant fundraising capabilities and a strong media presence. Christie's ability to attract large donors and to command media attention will be crucial in a crowded field. 5. Party Factionalism: The Republican Party is currently divided between those who are staunchly loyal to Donald Trump and those looking for a different direction. Christie's path to the nomination would likely require navigating these divisions effectively. Given these considerations, while Chris Christie has a background that could make him a plausible candidate for the Republican nomination, the field is highly competitive, and his past criticisms of Trump may alienate a segment of the party base.

Historical Precedent: The 25th Amendment has been invoked a few times in U.S. history, but its Section 4, which allows the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the President unable to discharge his duties, has never been used. This suggests a high threshold for such action. 2. Political Climate: The current political climate in the United States is highly polarized. While there have been calls from some GOP lawmakers for President Biden to be removed from office via the 25th Amendment, these calls are largely seen as partisan maneuvers rather than genuine concerns for the President's ability to discharge his duties. 3. President Biden's Health: As of the last available information, President Biden has not shown any signs of incapacitation that would necessitate the invocation of the 25th Amendment. While his age might raise some health concerns, he has been actively carrying out his presidential duties. 4. Mechanisms and Thresholds: The process of invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment is complex and requires the concurrence of the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet. Given the seriousness of such a step, it is unlikely to be taken lightly or without clear and compelling evidence of incapacitation. 5. Time Frame: The question specifies a declaration before August 2024. Given the proximity of this date and the lack of any current moves towards invoking the 25th Amendment, the time frame further reduces the likelihood of such an event occurring.

Previous Presidential Runs: Chris Christie has previously run for president in the 2016 Republican primaries but dropped out early in the process. This experience might have both positive and negative impacts on his potential 2024 run. On one hand, he has the experience of running a national campaign, which could be beneficial. On the other hand, his previous withdrawal might be seen as a lack of staying power or broad appeal. 2. Current Political Landscape: The Republican Party has undergone significant changes since Christie's last run, with Donald Trump's presidency and continued influence over the party being a major factor. Christie's relationship with Trump has been complex, initially supporting him but later criticizing him, especially over the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. This dynamic might affect his chances, given the significant pro-Trump faction within the party. 3. Popularity and Fundraising: Christie's popularity within the Republican Party and his ability to raise funds are crucial. His performance in polls and his fundraising capabilities will significantly impact his chances of securing the nomination. As of my last update, there hasn't been a significant indication that he has built a substantial national campaign infrastructure or that he leads in polls. 4. Competition: The field of Republican candidates for the 2024 election is likely to be crowded, with several high-profile figures potentially running. The competition could dilute support and make it harder for Christie to stand out and secure the nomination. 5. Party Direction: The direction the Republican Party wants to take for the 2024 election will also play a significant role. If the party leans towards more moderate candidates, Christie might have a better chance. However, if the party continues to align closely with Trump or seeks a more conservative candidate, Christie's chances could be diminished. Given these considerations, while Chris Christie has the experience and potentially the desire to run, the current political landscape, his past performance, and the likely crowded field of candidates suggest that his chances of being the Republican nominee are not high."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "fdd614ff-df45-4039-85bd-14e74aaf5033", "title": "Will both Tim Scott and Chris Christie be the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Tim Scott and Chris Christie are selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Firstly, as of my last update in 2023, Tim Scott and Chris Christie are both figures within the Republican Party, but their paths to the nomination would be significantly different. Tim Scott, a senator from South Carolina, has been rising in prominence within the party, known for his conservative values and his efforts in areas such as tax reform and racial equity. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, has had a more tumultuous relationship with the party, particularly following his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal and his criticism of Donald Trump. The Republican Party's nomination process involves a series of primaries and caucuses across the states, culminating in the Republican National Convention where delegates officially select the party's nominee. For both Scott and Christie to be selected, they would need to perform well in these primaries and caucuses, appealing to a broad base of Republican voters and accumulating a significant number of delegates. Historically, it is rare for a party to nominate two individuals who are not seen as a clear ticket (president and vice president) early in the process. The pairing of nominees often comes later in the election cycle, sometimes not until the convention itself, and is usually strategic, aiming to balance the ticket geographically, ideologically, or demographically. Given these considerations, the likelihood of both Tim Scott and Chris Christie being selected as the nominees is low. While both have national profiles, the path to them both being on the ticket involves numerous variables aligning in their favor, including their performance in primaries, the strategic decisions of the party, and the preferences of a diverse set of Republican voters."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This trend is evident in the number of women who have been elected to Congress and other political offices in recent years. However, the specific outcome of the 2024 Democratic Presidential nomination depends heavily on who decides to run. High-profile female candidates who have run in previous elections, such as Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, have shown that women can be strong contenders for the nomination. Yet, the success of their campaigns can depend on numerous factors, including their policies, public perception, and the overall political climate at the time of the election. Given the information available up to 2023, without knowing the specific candidates who will run in 2024, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

These factors include new polls, changes in the overall political climate, and updates to the model itself. Given that the model is updated regularly and that new polls are released frequently, it's possible that Harris's odds could fluctuate. However, without specific information about upcoming events or polls that could significantly impact her chances, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether her odds will increase. That being said, considering the short timeframe (one week) and the nature of electoral polling models which tend to have some level of stability unless major events occur, a significant increase might be less likely. However, minor fluctuations are common, and an increase above 46.6% is plausible if there are several polls showing favorable results for Harris or if there's a notable positive development in her campaign.

His influence over the party and his popularity among certain segments of the electorate could make him a strong contender for the nomination if he chooses to run. 2.

Their potential candidacies would likely face different challenges and considerations. 4. Party Dynamics and Opposition: The dynamics within the Republican Party, including the emergence of other potential candidates and the party's overall direction, will play a crucial role in determining the nominee. Additionally, the Democratic Party's nominee and the broader political landscape could influence Republican voters' choices. 5.

Health and Incapacity: The president's health is a critical factor. If Biden were to suffer a severe health issue that renders him incapable of performing his duties, Vice President Kamala Harris could assume the role of Acting President under the 25th Amendment. However, there has been no public indication of such health concerns that would lead to his incapacitation by the end of July. 2. Resignation: Voluntary resignation is another possibility. However, there have been no public statements or indications from Biden or his administration suggesting that he plans to resign. 3. Impeachment and Removal: Impeachment by the House of Representatives followed by a trial and removal by the Senate could also end Biden's presidency. Given the current composition of Congress and the lack of any active impeachment proceedings with broad bipartisan support, this scenario seems highly unlikely to unfold by the end of July. 4. Death: The most unpredictable factor is the possibility of death. While tragic and unforeseen events can occur, there is no public information suggesting that Biden is in poor health or that there are any specific concerns for his safety beyond the usual security threats that any U.S. president faces. Considering these factors, there is no clear indication that Joe Biden will not be president by the end of July 2024. The lack of any evident health issues, the improbability of resignation without any prior indication, the unlikelihood of impeachment and removal within such a short timeframe, and the unpredictability but low probability of death within the next few weeks all contribute to the conclusion that it is likely Joe Biden will still be president by the end of July."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "7d1b177f-1707-4c21-aeae-4bc73f43c9e4", "title": "Will at least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early?", "body": "Context from Politico:\n\nDozens of House Democrats are organizing a plan to speak out against their own party\u2019s effort to seal President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination sooner than originally planned, which they argue stifles the intense ongoing debate about his candidacy, according to a lawmaker involved in the effort.\n\nA drafted letter, circulated by Rep.

His base within the party appears to remain loyal, which is a crucial factor in primary elections. 2. **Potential Competitors**: Several other Republicans have expressed interest or are rumored to be considering a run for the 2024 nomination. These include state governors, senators, and other political figures. The strength and viability of these competitors can erode Trump's chances, especially if they can consolidate anti-Trump sentiment within the party or attract significant funding and endorsements. 3. **Party Dynamics**: The Republican Party's internal dynamics will play a crucial role. Trump has maintained a strong grip on the party's grassroots, but there are also significant elements within the party's establishment that are openly critical of him. The party's desire for unity ahead of the general election could influence the nomination process, potentially affecting Trump's chances. 4. **Legal and Financial Factors**: Trump faces several legal challenges that could impact his candidacy, both financially and in terms of public perception. The outcomes of these challenges and their timing could significantly affect his ability to secure the nomination. 5. **Historical Precedents**: Historically, American political parties have been hesitant to nominate the same individual for a third time, especially after losing a previous election. However, Trump's unique hold on the party could make him an exception to this trend.

Given these factors, it's difficult to make a precise prediction, but we can look at some general trends. Norway has qualified for the final in about half of the contests they have participated in since the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004.

However, both countries have dedicated fan bases and usually send entries that are well-produced and have the potential to appeal to a broad audience. Finland has shown a slight edge in qualifying for the final in recent years, thanks in part to entries like 'Hard Rock Hallelujah' by Lordi, which won the contest in 2006, and more recent successes. Norway, on the other hand, has had some standout performances as well, including their win in 2009 with 'Fairytale' by Alexander Rybak.

Low approval ratings, particularly among Democratic voters, could increase pressure on Senators to distance themselves from the President. 3. Primary Challenges: If President Biden faces a strong primary challenge within the Democratic Party, it could lead to increased calls for him to step aside, especially if his challengers gain significant traction and support among Democratic voters and donors. 4. Public Statements and Endorsements: Senators often make calculated decisions about when to endorse or withdraw support from a candidate. Public statements by influential Senators can serve as a barometer for the broader sentiments within the party. 5.

However, in recent years, Norway has shown a relatively consistent performance, often qualifying for the final. 2. Semi-final Format: The Eurovision semi-finals are divided into two nights, with each participating country (except the Big Five: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) performing once. The top 10 countries from each semi-final, as voted by a combination of jury and public votes, qualify for the Grand Final. This format means that Norway will compete against roughly half of the participating countries for a spot in the final. 3. Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the performing artist can significantly impact a country's chances of qualifying. While the specific details about Norway's entry for Eurovision 2024 are not provided, Norway often selects its entries through a national final (Melodi Grand Prix), which can help in choosing a competitive song. 4.

However, in 2021, Switzerland achieved a respectable 3rd place in the Grand Final with Gjon's Tears and the song 'Tout l'univers.' This recent success could indicate a positive trend in their participation. 2. Selection Process: Switzerland often uses a national final or an internal selection to choose their Eurovision entry. The method of selection can impact the quality and appeal of the act chosen. If they opt for a well-organized national final or a careful internal selection, the chances of picking a competitive act increase. 3.

A catchy song with a memorable performance can significantly increase the likelihood of qualification, regardless of the country's historical performance. 5.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update in 2023, the Republican field for the 2024 presidential election is wide open. While there are several potential candidates, including well-known figures like Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, the field has not yet solidified. This openness means there is still room for less prominent candidates to emerge. 2. Will Hurd's Background: Will Hurd is a former CIA officer and served as a U.S. Representative from Texas's 23rd congressional district from 2015 to 2021. His background in national security and his experience in Congress could be seen as assets in a presidential campaign, especially in a field where national security and integrity might become key issues. 3. Hurd's Political Positioning: Hurd has been known for his moderate positions on some issues, which could potentially appeal to a broader base of voters. However, in a Republican primary, more conservative candidates often have an advantage. Hurd's ability to navigate these dynamics and appeal to a broad enough segment of Republican voters will be crucial. 4. Fundraising and Support: A successful presidential campaign requires significant financial backing and organizational support. As of my last update, it's unclear how Hurd's fundraising efforts compare to other potential candidates. The ability to raise funds and build a strong campaign infrastructure will be a critical factor in his success. 5. Primary Election Dynamics: The outcome of primary elections can be highly unpredictable, influenced by factors such as voter turnout, debate performances, and unforeseen events. A candidate's success can snowball quickly based on early victories or significant media coverage. Considering these factors, while Will Hurd has a compelling background that could potentially resonate with voters, the field for the Republican nomination is crowded and includes several candidates with higher national profiles and potentially stronger fundraising capabilities. Therefore, without more specific data on Hurd's campaign efforts, fundraising success, and current polling, it's reasonable to consider his chances as relatively low compared to more established figures in the party."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "4acc0ddd-53b6-4f22-9c1d-7769ee812765", "title": "[Metaculus] Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democra...nomination for President?", "body": "Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nResolves the same as the original on Metaculus.\n\n(https://www.metaculus.com/questions/question_embed/25755/?theme=dark)Resolution criteria\n\nThis question will resolve as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.\n\nTo qualify for a Yes resolution, the statement must be unambiguous and conclusive: it should leave no room for the possibility that Biden would accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nIf such a definitive statement is not made prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, this question will resolve as No.\n\nFine print and additional background information can be found on Metaculus.\n\nOnce the original resolves, its resolution will be applied to this market automatically.

Event (a): Meta Publishes a Report with Results from External Red-Teaming of Their Models for Safety by June 30, 2024. Meta, like other major tech companies involved in AI development, has been under scrutiny for the safety and ethical implications of its AI models. The company has shown a commitment to addressing these concerns through various initiatives, including research and transparency reports. Red-teaming, especially by external parties, is a valuable practice for identifying vulnerabilities and safety issues in AI models. It's a proactive approach that companies serious about safety are likely to engage in, especially as regulatory and public scrutiny increases. The publication of results from such red-teaming efforts would be in line with Meta's interest in demonstrating transparency and commitment to AI safety. However, the decision to publish results publicly might depend on the outcomes of the red-teaming exercises and strategic considerations regarding what information is shared publicly. Given these considerations, the likelihood of Meta publishing a report seems plausible, especially as it aligns with broader industry trends towards transparency and accountability in AI development. Event (b): The Linked Market Gets at Least 377 Traders by End of July 15, 2024. The interest in AI-related markets, especially those concerning safety and ethics, has been growing. This growth is driven by increased awareness and concern about AI's implications on society. Achieving a specific number of traders (377) seems like a modest goal for a market focused on a timely and relevant topic. However, trader engagement can be influenced by various factors, including market visibility, the perceived importance of the topic, and the ease of participating in the market. The dynamics of online prediction markets can be unpredictable, with participation influenced by factors such as the perceived likelihood of the event, the potential for financial gain, and the overall interest in the topic at the time. Considering these points, achieving 377 traders seems feasible, especially if the market is well-promoted and remains relevant to current events and interests. Combining the Probabilities: To estimate the combined probability of both events occurring, we would ideally calculate the probability of each event and then multiply them, assuming independence. However, without explicit probabilities for each event, we'll provide a holistic assessment considering the interplay of factors mentioned. Given the reasoning above, both events seem plausible, with the publication of a report by Meta being somewhat more uncertain due to the specific nature of the action and the company's strategic considerations. The achievement of a certain number of traders on the market appears more directly influenced by factors that can be controlled or predicted, such as promotion and relevance. Therefore, considering the plausibility of both events but also acknowledging the uncertainties involved, a combined probability might lean towards a cautiously optimistic estimate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06471681969332244, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.02157227323110748, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.36524578353570125, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Elon Musk's Interest in Cryptocurrency: Elon Musk has shown a significant interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. His companies, such as Tesla and SpaceX, have even accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment in the past. This interest suggests a possibility of his involvement in significant cryptocurrency events. 2. Public Appearances and Engagements: Elon Musk is known for his active presence on social media platforms and his participation in various conferences and interviews. However, his appearances are often related to his business ventures or specific interests at the time. Given the relevance of cryptocurrency to some of his business activities, his appearance at a major Bitcoin conference isn't implausible. 3. Bitcoin Nashville 2024's Significance: Being one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, Bitcoin Nashville 2024 would likely attract prominent figures in the cryptocurrency space. The event's size and significance could make it an attractive platform for Elon Musk to share his thoughts on cryptocurrency, especially if he has developments or announcements related to his businesses and cryptocurrency. 4. Scheduling and Availability: Elon Musk's schedule is notoriously busy, given his involvement in multiple large-scale ventures. His appearance would depend on his availability during the conference dates and whether he sees the event as a priority. 5. Past Appearances and Surprises: Elon Musk has made unexpected appearances and announcements in the past. While there might not be any current indication of his intention to attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, his history suggests he is capable of surprises. Considering these factors, while there's no concrete evidence to confirm Elon Musk's appearance at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 as of the last update, his interests, past behaviors, and the significance of the event suggest a possibility.

Past Performance: Georgia has participated in Eurovision since 2007 but has had mixed success. They have qualified for the Grand Final several times, but their entries have varied significantly in style and appeal. Understanding their historical performance can provide a baseline for expectations but is not a definitive predictor of future success. 2. Current Trends and Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting patterns often reflect a mix of song quality, performance, and geopolitical alliances. Some countries tend to vote more frequently for their neighbors or countries with which they have cultural or historical ties. However, the contest also tries to balance this with a mix of jury and public voting. Georgia's position in the Caucasus might influence some voting patterns, but the song's quality and performance are increasingly critical in securing a spot in the Grand Final. 3. Song and Performance Quality: The quality of the song and the live performance are crucial factors. A catchy, well-performed song that resonates with both the public and the juries has a higher chance of qualifying. Information about Georgia's 2024 entry, including the artist and song style, would be essential in making a more informed prediction. 4. Changes to Contest Format or Rules: Any changes to the qualification process, voting system, or performance rules could impact Georgia's chances. For example, changes in how countries are allocated to semi-finals or how voting is conducted could influence qualification odds. Given the lack of specific information about Georgia's entry for Eurovision 2024, such as the song and artist, and without knowing the exact lineup of competing countries and any potential changes to the contest format, it's challenging to provide a highly accurate prediction. However, considering Georgia's past participation and the general dynamics of the contest, a moderate estimate of their qualification chances can be made."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "b0539958-168d-437d-b965-598ad414b0a2", "title": "Will Albania qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Albania participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Albania has been participating in Eurovision since 2004 and has qualified for the Grand Final several times, though not consistently. Their qualification record shows a mix of successes and failures, which suggests that while they have the potential to create songs that appeal to the Eurovision audience, their entries are not always competitive enough to secure a spot in the final. Music trends play a significant role in Eurovision, with some years favoring certain genres over others. However, without knowing the specifics of Albania's entry for 2024, including the artist, song genre, and performance details, it's challenging to assess how well it will align with current trends and voter preferences. Voting patterns are another crucial factor. Eurovision voting can be influenced by various factors, including geographical alliances, diaspora voting, and the order of performance. Albania might benefit from votes from neighboring countries or those with significant Albanian diaspora populations, but this is not a guarantee for qualification. Lastly, any changes to the contest format or voting rules could impact Albania's chances. However, as of my last update, there was no information on significant changes that would drastically alter the qualification process. Given these considerations, predicting Albania's qualification with certainty is difficult.

Previous Announcements and Trends: Disney often uses the D23 Expo to announce new attractions and expansions for its theme parks. Moana, being a highly successful and popular franchise, is a prime candidate for a themed ride. Given the trend of Disney leveraging popular franchises for new attractions, this factor leans towards a positive announcement. 2. Park Expansion and Demand: Magic Kingdom, being one of the most visited theme parks in the world, is always looking for ways to expand and improve its offerings to meet the high demand and expectations of its visitors. A Moana-themed ride would likely be a significant draw, especially considering the film's popularity and the current lack of Moana-themed attractions in the park. 3. Competition and Market Trends: The theme park industry is highly competitive, and Disney must continually innovate to stay ahead. With competitors like Universal Studios announcing new attractions and themed areas, Disney has a strong incentive to keep its parks fresh and exciting. A Moana ride would align with this strategy. 4. Rumors and Leaks: While not always reliable, rumors and leaks from credible sources within the Disney fan community can sometimes hint at upcoming announcements. However, without specific information on any rumors or leaks regarding a Moana ride for Magic Kingdom, this factor remains neutral. 5. Disney's Investment in Intellectual Property: Disney has shown a willingness to invest heavily in its intellectual properties, especially those with the potential for broad appeal and merchandising opportunities. Moana, with its global success and beloved characters, fits this criterion well. Considering these factors, there's a reasonable basis to believe that Disney might announce a new Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024, given the strategic alignment with Disney's business goals, the popularity of the franchise, and the competitive landscape of the theme park industry."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "fc1804cb-d227-4797-9c13-d5282ac7115c", "title": "Will Deadpool & Wolverine have biggest opening weekend ever for R-rated movie?

Current Political Standing: As of my last update, Mike Pence has maintained a relatively high profile since leaving office. He has been involved in various initiatives and has continued to engage with the public and the media. However, his popularity and influence within the Republican Party have been overshadowed by other figures, notably former President Donald Trump, who has indicated interest in running for the presidency again. 2. Potential Competitors: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 election is wide and includes several high-profile figures. Besides Donald Trump, other possible contenders such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Ted Cruz have significant support within different factions of the party. The competition is likely to be intense, and Pence would need to differentiate himself and garner substantial support from party delegates. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party is currently divided between those who remain loyal to Trump and those looking for a new direction. Pence's association with Trump could be both a blessing and a curse. While it might earn him some support from Trump loyalists, it could also alienate those seeking a fresh start. 4. Pence's Strategy: Pence has attempted to carve out his own identity and build a base of support. He has focused on issues that align with conservative values and has tried to position himself as a leader who can unite different factions of the party. However, it's unclear whether this strategy will be enough to secure the nomination. Considering these factors, while Mike Pence has a path to the nomination, it appears challenging.

Current Political Trends: The European Green Party and its national member parties have seen a significant surge in popularity in various European countries in recent years, largely due to increased awareness and concern about climate change, environmental issues, and a desire for more progressive policies. This trend suggests a potential for the Greens\u2013EFA to gain more seats. 2. Previous Election Performance: In the 2019 European Parliament elections, the Greens\u2013EFA saw a significant increase in their representation, becoming the fourth-largest group in the European Parliament. This momentum could potentially carry forward into the 2024 elections, depending on how well the group capitalizes on current political sentiments. 3. Political Landscape: The European political landscape is highly dynamic, with shifts in voter preferences and the emergence of new political forces. The Greens\u2013EFA's ability to hold the most seats would depend on their campaign strategies, the appeal of their policies, and how they compare to other political groups in addressing key European issues. 4. Competition: Other political groups, such as the European People's Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), and the Renew Europe group, are traditionally strong contenders in European Parliament elections. The performance of these groups will directly impact the Greens\u2013EFA's chances of holding the most seats. 5. Tie Scenario: The question allows for a scenario where if two groups are tied for seats, both would be considered as holding the most seats. This slightly increases the probability of a \"Yes\" resolution since a tie is a more achievable outcome than outright victory. Given these considerations, while the Greens\u2013EFA have momentum and are likely to perform well, the European Parliament elections are highly competitive, and other groups also have strong bases of support. Therefore, the probability of the Greens\u2013EFA holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections is not extremely high but is still a plausible outcome."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "58fb06db-2cec-478e-97fb-afd1a70355b5", "title": "Will OpenAI's ChatGPT be generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024?", "body": "The question resolves as **YES** if [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) is generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, and **NO** otherwise.\n\n\"Generally available\" here means that the default state for people in the EU is that they can access it without a VPN (possibly requiring paying for it.)

Regulatory Compliance: The EU has been actively working on regulations for AI, including the AI Act, which aims to provide a framework for the development and deployment of AI systems within the EU. OpenAI would need to ensure that ChatGPT complies with these regulations, which could include requirements for transparency, accountability, and data protection. Given the complexity of these regulations and the need for careful legal and ethical considerations, there's a risk that compliance issues could delay availability. 2. Expansion Plans: OpenAI has shown interest in expanding its services globally, but the pace of this expansion can be influenced by various factors, including market demand, competition, and regulatory environments. If OpenAI prioritizes other markets or faces unexpected challenges in the EU market, this could impact the general availability of ChatGPT. 3. Potential Roadblocks: Beyond regulatory compliance, other potential roadblocks could include technical challenges, public perception, and political considerations. For instance, if there's significant public concern over privacy or the ethical use of AI in certain EU countries, this could lead to political pressure to restrict or delay the service's availability. Considering these factors, while OpenAI has a vested interest in making ChatGPT widely available, including in the EU, the path to general availability is fraught with potential challenges.

For event (a), predicting the outcome of the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections is challenging due to the complex nature of European politics and the numerous factors that can influence election results. However, as of my last update, the Greens\u2013EFA group has been a significant force in the European Parliament but not the largest group. The largest groups have historically been the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). The likelihood of the Greens\u2013EFA surpassing these groups in the 2024 elections could be considered low based on historical trends, but it's not impossible given the shifting political landscapes and growing environmental concerns. For event (b), OpenAI's ChatGPT being generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, involves considerations around regulatory compliance and OpenAI's business strategy. The European Union has been actively working on regulations concerning AI, including the AI Act, which aims to ensure AI systems are safe and compliant with EU values. OpenAI would need to comply with these regulations to make ChatGPT generally available in the EU. Given the pace of regulatory developments and the potential for OpenAI to adapt its service to comply with EU regulations, the likelihood of ChatGPT being available could be considered moderate to high, depending on the specifics of the regulatory environment and OpenAI's compliance efforts. Considering both events need to occur for the question to resolve as YES, we must multiply the probabilities of each event happening. Given the challenging nature of predicting election outcomes and the regulatory landscape for AI in the EU, I would estimate the probability of the Greens\u2013EFA holding the most seats as low (let's say around 0.2) and the probability of ChatGPT being generally available in the EU as moderate (around 0.6).

Current Trend and Polling Volatility: As of the last available data before my knowledge cutoff, Trump has been leading Biden in the polls. However, the lead has been relatively narrow, often within the margin of error of many polls. Polling averages can fluctuate based on the latest polls included in the average, the methodologies of those polls, and the sample sizes. A lead of greater than 2 but less than or equal to 3 points suggests a relatively stable but narrow advantage for Trump. 2. Significant Events: Between now and July 15, 2024, several factors could influence the polls, including economic indicators, debates (if any occur before this date), major policy announcements, or significant domestic or international events. The impact of these events can be unpredictable and could either bolster or erode Trump's lead. 3. 538's Methodology: FiveThirtyEight's polling average is considered robust because it weights polls based on their quality, sample size, and recency. However, the inclusion of new polls with different methodologies or samples can cause shifts in the average. Given these considerations, predicting a specific margin within a tight range more than a month in advance involves significant uncertainty.

Historical Context: Israel and Iran have a long history of conflict, with tensions escalating significantly since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Israel views Iran as a significant threat, especially concerning its nuclear program, and has been involved in various covert operations aimed at disrupting this program. 2. Recent Tensions: As of my last update, tensions between Israel and Iran remain high, with both countries engaging in proxy conflicts and rhetorical exchanges. Israel has been particularly concerned about Iran's military presence in Syria and Lebanon, as well as its nuclear activities. 3. Strategic Interests: Israel has a strategic interest in limiting Iran's military and nuclear capabilities. If Israel perceives that Iran is making significant advancements in its nuclear program or that there is an immediate threat from Iranian proxies, it might consider a preemptive strike. 4. Timeframe: The question specifies a timeframe before May 1, 2024. Given the volatility of the situation, it's challenging to predict with certainty, but the relatively short timeframe suggests that any existing plans or operations might not have enough time to be fully executed, unless there's an immediate perceived threat. 5. International Context: The international community's stance, particularly that of the United States, could influence Israel's decision-making.

The first part involves predicting whether 'Twisters' (2024) will achieve a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of at least 75%. The second part requires determining if 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will have a higher domestic box office opening than the combined openings of 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'The Wolverine' (2013). 1. 'Twisters' (2024) Achieving a Rotten Tomatoes Critics Score of at Least 75%: - Director's Track Record: Lee Isaac Chung's previous work, particularly 'Minari' (2020), received critical acclaim with a 98% Rotten Tomatoes score. This indicates Chung's capability to produce high-quality films that resonate with critics. - Cast Performance: The film stars Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones, both of whom have been involved in successful projects. Their performances could contribute to a positive critical reception. - Genre and Subject Matter: The success of a film critically can sometimes depend on its genre and how it tackles its subject matter. Without specific details on 'Twisters' (2024), it's challenging to assess this aspect directly. However, assuming it's well-executed, there's potential for critical acclaim. 2. 'Deadpool & Wolverine' Having a Higher Domestic Box Office Opening Than 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' Combined: - Franchise Popularity: Both Deadpool and Wolverine are extremely popular characters within the X-Men franchise. Their combination in a single film could potentially draw in a massive audience, leveraging the fanbase of both characters. - Previous Box Office Performance: 'Deadpool' (2016) had a remarkable opening, and while 'The Wolverine' (2013) did well, the combined opening of $185,548,391 sets a high but achievable bar for 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' considering the growth in the fanbase and the general increase in box office numbers over time. - Marketing and Competition: The success of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' at the box office would also depend on its marketing campaign and the competitive landscape at the time of its release. A well-executed marketing strategy could significantly boost its opening numbers. Given these considerations, we can estimate the probabilities: - For 'Twisters' (2024) achieving a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of at least 75%, considering the director's track record and the cast's potential, the probability seems moderately high. Let's estimate it around 0.60. - For 'Deadpool & Wolverine' having a higher domestic box office opening than 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' combined, given the popularity of the characters and the potential for a strong marketing campaign, this seems quite likely. Let's estimate this probability around 0.70. However, since the question seems to ask for a single probability for both events occurring (though it's phrased in a somewhat ambiguous manner without explicit conjunction or disjunction between the two parts), we must interpret it as requiring both conditions to be met for a 'YES' resolution. Therefore, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event occurring. Combined Probability = Probability of 'Twisters' achieving at least 75% on Rotten Tomatoes * Probability of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' exceeding the combined box office opening of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' Combined Probability = 0.60 * 0.70 = 0.42. Reasoning: As detailed above, considering the factors influencing the critical success of 'Twisters' and the box office potential of 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' we derive a combined probability for both specified conditions to be met."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0019580593202065955, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0006526864400688651, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.06280990705936994, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Tucker Carlson's Background and Career: Tucker Carlson is a well-known American television host, journalist, and conservative commentator. He has been hosting his own show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, on Fox News since 2016. While he has significant influence in conservative media, his background is more aligned with journalism and commentary rather than traditional politics. 2. Political Experience and Ambition: As of the last available information, Tucker Carlson has not held or sought political office. His influence is significant in the realm of public opinion, but there's a substantial difference between media influence and political candidacy, especially for the highest office in the United States. 3. 2024 Republican Nomination Process: The Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential election will be determined by the delegates of the Republican National Convention. This process involves a series of primaries and caucuses across the United States, culminating in the convention where delegates officially select the party's nominee. 4. Potential Candidates and Competition: The field of potential candidates for the 2024 Republican nomination is broad and includes several individuals with more direct political experience than Tucker Carlson. The competition for the nomination is expected to be fierce, with several high-profile politicians and possibly former President Donald Trump considering a run. 5. Carlson's Public Statements and Actions: There has been no clear indication from Tucker Carlson that he intends to run for the presidency in 2024. His focus appears to remain on his media career, using his platform to influence public opinion and policy discussions rather than seeking elected office. Considering these points, the likelihood of Tucker Carlson being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election is low.

However, considering the general trend of increasing volatility in times of economic uncertainty and the fact that 2024 might still be experiencing the aftermath of recent global economic challenges, there's a plausible argument to be made that volatility could remain elevated or increase.

(b) Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024: This aspect of the question involves geopolitical tensions and military actions, which are inherently unpredictable.

Given these uncertainties, assessing the likelihood of such an attack requires a deep understanding of the current geopolitical landscape, which can change rapidly. While tensions might be high, and the possibility of military action cannot be dismissed, the specific outcome and timing are difficult to predict with confidence.

However, the Republican field is expected to be crowded, with several other notable candidates, including former President Donald Trump, who has also announced his candidacy. 2. Popularity and Recognition: Nikki Haley has a certain level of national recognition, having served as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations under President Trump and as the Governor of South Carolina. Her experience in both state and federal government could be seen as an asset. However, her level of recognition and popularity might not be as high as some other potential candidates, including Trump. 3.

However, the choice of VP can depend on various strategic considerations, including electoral strategy, party unity, and the presidential candidate's preferences.

However, the frequency of such interviews and their duration can vary widely. 2. Nature of Qualifying Interviews: The criteria for what constitutes a qualifying interview are quite specific. It must be in-person, on camera, and at least 45 minutes long. This rules out many common appearances such as press conferences, speeches, rallies, and fundraisers, which are more frequent but do not meet the criteria. 3. Timeframe: The question pertains to a specific timeframe - before the end of July 2024. This is a relatively short period, limiting the number of opportunities for such an interview to occur. 4. Political and Public Engagement Strategy: The strategy for public appearances and interviews can be influenced by political considerations, especially in an election year. The decision to engage in a long, in-depth interview may be strategically made to address specific issues, reach a particular audience, or to counterbalance recent narratives. 5. Availability and Scheduling: The schedules of both the President and potential interviewers (e.g., late-night show hosts, podcasters, journalists) play a significant role. Coordinating such an interview requires aligning the schedules of two busy parties.

Current Polling Average: The question does not provide the current polling average at the time of its creation (July 8, 2024), but for the sake of this analysis, let's assume Trump is leading by 2.4 points as of July 5, 2024, as mentioned in the example. 2. Polling Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological differences among polls. However, significant shifts in a short period (in this case, from July 8 to July 15, 2024) are relatively rare, especially in a well-established race like the presidential election. 3. Trend Analysis: Without access to the most current data or trends, it's challenging to assess whether Trump's lead is increasing, decreasing, or stable. However, given the narrow margin mentioned (a lead greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4), a slight increase from the assumed 2.4 points would be necessary but not unprecedented. 4. Margin of Error and Statistical Variability: Polling averages, like individual polls, have margins of error. A shift from 2.4 points to within the 3 to 4-point range could be within the margin of error of some polls, especially if new polls released between July 8 and July 15 show a slight increase in Trump's favorability. 5. External Factors: Events occurring between July 8 and July 15 could influence public opinion. Positive news or actions by Trump, or negative ones for Biden, could potentially increase Trump's lead. Conversely, negative news for Trump or positive for Biden could decrease Trump's lead. Given these considerations, predicting a precise lead within a narrow range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points) involves a high degree of uncertainty.

Historical Context: In previous Olympics, it has been common for top tennis players to compete in and win multiple events. For instance, the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, have both won multiple gold medals in singles and doubles. This suggests that winning more than one medal is achievable for top athletes. 2. Competition Format: Tennis at the Olympics typically includes singles and doubles events for both men and women, as well as a mixed doubles event. This provides multiple opportunities for athletes to win medals. 3. Player Participation: The decision of top players to participate in the Olympics can significantly impact the competition. While some top players may choose not to participate for various reasons (e.g., schedule conflicts, personal reasons), many see the Olympics as a prestigious event and an opportunity to represent their country. 4. Competition Level: The level of competition in Olympic tennis is extremely high, with many of the world's top players participating. However, the ability of a player to win more than one medal often depends on their skill level, physical condition, and the ability to maintain performance over the course of the tournament. 5. Recent Trends: In recent years, there has been a trend of specialization in tennis, with some players focusing more on singles or doubles. However, versatile players who excel in both singles and doubles or in mixed doubles still exist and have the potential to win multiple medals. Considering these factors, the likelihood of an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics seems reasonable. The presence of talented players who can compete at a high level in multiple events increases the chances of this happening."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "9d2e2e2d-9dd2-4fff-8e32-77879a04e744", "title": "Will Individual Neutral Athletes Win \u226521 Gold Medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Individual Neutral Athletes collectively win 21 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

Condition (a) - An athlete wins more than one medal for tennis: Tennis at the Olympics typically includes several events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. This spread gives athletes multiple opportunities to win medals. Top tennis players often participate in both singles and doubles events, increasing their chances of winning more than one medal. However, winning more than one medal also depends on the competition, the player's form, and their doubles partnership (if applicable). Historically, it's not uncommon for top tennis players to win multiple medals at the Olympics, but it's also not a guarantee. Given these factors, let's estimate the probability of condition (a) being met as moderately high, around 0.7. Condition (b) - Individual Neutral Athletes win 21 or more gold medals: The term 'Individual Neutral Athletes' likely refers to athletes competing under the Olympic flag or a neutral designation due to various reasons such as sanctions against their home country. The number of gold medals won by such athletes can vary greatly depending on the number of athletes competing under the neutral designation, the sports and events they participate in, and the level of competition. Without knowing the exact number of Individual Neutral Athletes and the events they'll be competing in, it's challenging to predict their gold medal count accurately. However, winning 21 or more gold medals would require a significant presence and success across multiple sports and events, which seems unlikely given the usual distribution of Olympic medals. Given these considerations, the probability of condition (b) being met seems relatively low, around 0.2. Combining the probabilities of both independent conditions being met requires multiplying the probabilities of each condition: 0.7 (condition a) * 0.2 (condition b) = 0.14.

Since the question pertains to July 31, 2024, he would still be within his term, making it likely for him to be president unless extraordinary circumstances occur. 2. Health and Age: As of my last update, Joe Biden is one of the oldest serving presidents in U.S. history. His age and health could potentially impact his ability to serve, but as of now, there is no public indication that his health would lead to him stepping down before the end of July 2024. 3. Impeachment or Resignation: While impeachment proceedings against Joe Biden have been initiated by the House of Representatives, as of my last update, there hasn't been a successful impeachment and removal from office of a U.S. president in history, except for the resignation of Richard Nixon before a likely impeachment. The process of impeachment and removal requires a majority vote in the House and a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which is a high threshold, especially considering the political composition of the Senate as of my last update. 4. Political Climate: The political climate in the United States is highly polarized, but unless there is a significant development that would lead to a bipartisan effort to remove the president, it is unlikely that Joe Biden would be removed from office.

Current Polling Trends: As of the last available data before the question was asked (early June 2023), we would need to know the current polling numbers. However, without access to real-time data or specific trends from that period, we can only speculate based on general knowledge. Historically, polling averages can fluctuate, but they tend to remain within a certain range unless significant events occur. 2. Historical Context: Polling averages can be volatile, but a lead of greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points is relatively narrow. Such margins can easily shift due to various factors, including campaign events, economic changes, and external factors like major news stories. 3. Time Frame: The question pertains to a date roughly a year after it was asked. This is a long period in political terms, during which many factors could influence public opinion and, consequently, polling numbers. 4. Polling Margin of Error: Most polls have a margin of error, typically around 3-4%. This means that even if a poll shows a lead within the specified range, it might not reflect the actual voting intentions due to the inherent uncertainty in polling. 5. Event Uncertainty: Between the time the question was posed and the resolution date, numerous events could occur that would significantly impact the polling numbers. These include debates, policy announcements, and unforeseen events (e.g., economic shifts, international crises). Given these considerations, predicting with high confidence that Trump's lead will fall within such a narrow range on a specific date far in the future is challenging. The factors influencing polling averages are too numerous and unpredictable, making precise forecasts difficult. Therefore, without more specific data on current trends or a method to accurately predict future events, we must conclude that the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, is relatively low due to the inherent uncertainties involved."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "58082894-6308-4784-a03c-eb4046410629", "title": "Will Glenn Youngkin be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Glenn Youngkin is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Historical Performance: Historically, swimmers have performed exceptionally well at the Olympics. The sport offers a wide range of events, which increases the potential for athletes to win multiple medals. Notable swimmers like Michael Phelps have set records for the most gold medals won by an individual in Olympic history, demonstrating the potential for high medal counts in swimming. 2. Competition Format: Swimming competitions at the Olympics are structured in a way that allows top athletes to compete in multiple events. This is unlike some other sports where athletes or teams might be limited to competing in a single event. The ability to participate in multiple races (e.g., different strokes and distances) increases a swimmer's chances of accumulating medals. 3. Global Talent Pool: The global talent pool in swimming is deep, but it's also a sport where a few exceptional athletes can dominate multiple events. This concentration of talent can lead to a scenario where one swimmer accumulates a significant number of gold medals. 4. Comparative Advantage in Medal Accumulation: Compared to other sports, swimming has a relatively high number of events. This increases the chances for a swimmer to win more medals compared to athletes in sports with fewer events. 5.

Internal Party Dissent: The context indicates there is a significant level of dissent within the Democratic Party regarding the plan to nominate President Biden early. This dissent suggests that there is a faction within the party that is not aligned with the party leadership's strategy, which could lead to public displays of opposition. 2. Organized Effort: The mention of \"dozens of House Democrats\" organizing a plan to speak out against the early nomination indicates a level of coordination and intent among party members. This organized effort increases the likelihood of a public letter being drafted and signed. 3. Drafted Letter: The existence of a drafted letter, as mentioned, is a tangible step towards public opposition. The fact that it has been circulated by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) provides evidence of concrete actions being taken by those opposed to the early nomination plan. 4. Public Signal: The letter represents the \"first public signal\" from Democrats that there is significant unrest regarding President Biden's candidacy. This willingness to make the dissent public could encourage others to join, potentially reaching the threshold of 20 signatures. 5. Resolution Criteria: The market resolves to YES if a public letter (or multiple letters) opposing the early nomination plan is signed by at least 20 House Members or Senators who caucus with the Democratic Party before the market close. This specific, measurable criterion makes it easier to assess the probability based on the actions and intentions of the individuals involved. Considering these points, the key factors influencing the probability are the level of dissent, the organized effort among Democrats, the existence of a drafted letter, and the willingness to make the dissent public.

Number of Candidates: A brokered convention is more likely when there are multiple strong candidates who split the vote, preventing any one candidate from achieving a majority (more than 50% of the delegates) in the first round of voting. As of my last update, the Democratic field is relatively narrow compared to the 2020 election cycle, which saw a historically large number of candidates. 2. Delegate Allocation Rules: The Democratic Party allocates delegates proportionally, which means candidates can accumulate delegates even if they don't win a majority in a particular state or district. However, the party also has rules requiring candidates to meet a minimum threshold of support (usually 15%) to be eligible for delegates. This can sometimes help narrow the field by denying delegates to weaker candidates. 3. Party Unity and Brokerage: The term \"brokered convention\" implies a scenario where party leaders or influential figures negotiate behind the scenes to coalesce support around a candidate. The likelihood of such negotiations succeeding depends on the party's internal dynamics and the willingness of candidates to compromise or withdraw. 4. Recent Trends and Polling: As of my last update, polling in the Democratic primary has shown a couple of front-runners with significant leads over the rest of the field. However, the landscape can change rapidly due to factors like debate performances, endorsements, and unforeseen events. Considering these factors, the current landscape suggests that while a brokered convention is possible, it seems less likely than a straightforward nomination process. The field is not as crowded as in previous cycles, and proportional delegate allocation can help the leading candidates accumulate delegates more efficiently. However, the dynamics of the primary can shift rapidly, and unforeseen developments could still lead to a scenario where no candidate achieves a majority on the first ballot."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "1bd3802b-b49f-46af-9be0-f32bde072ac0", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early (b) Democrats have a brokered convention in 2024?", "body": "(a) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early: This resolves YES if a public letter opposing the early nomination plan is signed by at least 20 House Members or Senators who caucus with the Democratic Party before market close at the end of Sunday, July 21st.

This could indicate a decrease in the overall quality of his films according to audience perceptions or a change in audience preferences. 3. **Film-Specific Factors**: The question mentions that 'Trap' has a 'great trailer.'

Without specific information on these factors, it's challenging to predict their impact accurately. Considering these points, while there is some positive indication from the trailer, the overall trend of declining CinemaScores for Shyamalan's recent films cannot be ignored.

Ted Cruz has a history of running for president, having been a candidate in the 2016 Republican primary. He won several primaries and caucuses, ultimately finishing second to Donald Trump. This experience could be beneficial if he decides to run again, as he has built a network of supporters and donors. However, Cruz's popularity within the Republican Party is a mixed bag. While he has a strong following among some conservative voters, others view him as too divisive or too focused on his own ambitions. His actions during the 2020 presidential election, particularly his role in objecting to the certification of Joe Biden's victory, have also been controversial. The field of potential candidates for the 2024 Republican nomination is likely to be crowded, with several high-profile figures already mentioned as possible contenders. These include Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley, among others. Cruz will face stiff competition from these candidates, many of whom have strong followings and significant fundraising abilities. The current political climate also plays a role in Cruz's chances. The Republican Party is still grappling with the aftermath of the 2020 election and the January 6th insurrection. Cruz's actions during this time have been criticized by some, which could hurt his standing with moderate voters. Given these factors, I estimate that Ted Cruz has a relatively low chance of being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Competition: The field of athletes in the events Hassan typically competes in (such as the 5000 meters and 10,000 meters) is highly competitive. Other top athletes from around the world, including emerging talents and seasoned competitors, will be vying for medals. The competition at the Olympics is always fierce, and there are no guarantees of success, even for the most accomplished athletes. 4. Injury and Health Status: As with any athlete, the risk of injury or health issues impacting performance is a consideration. However, Hassan has shown resilience and a strong ability to recover from setbacks in the past. 5. Olympic Experience: Hassan's experience at the Olympic Games, including her success in Tokyo, is a significant advantage. She knows what it takes to perform at the highest level on the biggest stage in sports. Given these considerations, it's reasonable to believe that Sifan Hassan has a strong chance of winning a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

In October 2022, a truck bomb damaged the bridge, and there have been reports of Ukrainian drone attacks on the bridge since then. Considering the bridge's strategic importance and the history of attacks on it, there is a significant risk of it being targeted again. Ukrainian forces may view the bridge as a legitimate military target, and the Russian military may not be able to effectively defend it against all types of attacks. However, it's also possible that the bridge may not be attacked, or that any attacks may not be successful in causing significant damage. The Russian military has likely taken steps to increase security measures around the bridge, and Ukrainian forces may prioritize other targets or choose not to attack the bridge for strategic or diplomatic reasons.

Health and Age: As of my last update, Joe Biden is in his early 80s. While age can increase the risk of health issues, there's no public indication that he suffers from any condition that would suddenly incapacitate him or force him to resign within a short timeframe like a couple of months. 2. Political Stability and Impeachment: The political landscape in the United States is highly polarized. However, impeachment proceedings, if any were to be initiated, are lengthy and involve both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Given the timeframe (resolution by the end of July 2024), and assuming there's no drastic, unforeseen event that would garner bipartisan support for such a measure, the likelihood of a successful impeachment and removal from office within this timeframe is low. 3. Resignation: There's no current indication that President Biden intends to resign. Resignations are rare in U.S. presidential history, and they usually occur in the face of severe scandal or personal health issues that prevent the president from performing their duties. 4. Other Factors: Other unforeseen events could potentially lead to a president's removal or incapacitation, such as accidents or sudden severe illness. However, these are inherently unpredictable and rare. Given these considerations, the likelihood of Joe Biden still being president by the end of July 2024 is relatively high, primarily due to the short timeframe involved and the lack of current indicators suggesting otherwise."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "670c11b8-9520-4233-90a3-a04e9dcbfeb5", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) the Crimean Bridge be hit with an attack before July 1, 2024, and (b) Joe Biden still be president by the end of July 2024?", "body": "(a) The Crimean Bridge is reported by credible sources to have been struck with weapons fire, explosives, or projectiles that could pose a credible threat to its integrity after May 2, 2024, and before July 1, 2024.

This suggests that such an event is highly unusual and unlikely. 2. Current Political Climate: As of the last available information in early July 2024, there were no clear indications from credible sources suggesting that President Biden intended to take such a drastic step. Major political decisions like these are usually preceded by significant speculation, leaks, or hints from the administration or related parties, none of which have been prominently reported. 3. Health and Personal Factors: Sometimes, health issues or personal crises can prompt sudden resignations. However, as of the last update, there was no public information indicating that President Biden was facing health issues severe enough to warrant resignation or that any personal factors would lead to such a decision. 4. Political Strategy: Dropping out of a re-election campaign and resigning would be an extraordinary move that could significantly impact the Democratic Party's chances in the election. It would likely be a strategic decision made with considerable input from party leaders, and there has been no indication of such discussions happening on a scale that would suggest this outcome. 5.

This section allows the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) to declare the President unable to discharge his duties, making the Vice President the Acting President. Several factors make this event unlikely: 1. Historical Precedent: The 25th Amendment has been invoked a few times, but primarily under Section 3, where the President voluntarily transfers power to the Vice President due to a temporary inability to serve (e.g., during medical procedures). Invocation under Section 4, without the President's consent, is unprecedented and represents a significant political and constitutional step that would likely be taken only in extreme circumstances. 2. Political Considerations: Such an action would have profound political implications and repercussions. It would require significant bipartisan agreement or a substantial shift in political will among the President's own party members, as well as independent confirmation of the President's inability to serve. Given the polarized nature of U.S. politics, achieving the necessary consensus would be challenging. 3. Medical and Public Evidence: There would need to be clear, publicly evident reasons for the President's incapacitation that would justify such a drastic measure. While President Biden's health has been a subject of public discussion, there has been no indication of an inability to discharge his duties that would warrant invocation of the 25th Amendment. 4. Procedural Hurdles: The process involves more than just a simple declaration. It requires written declaration by the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet, followed by a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate if contested by the President. This is a high bar to clear, especially considering the political divisions in Congress.

It's not a step that would be taken lightly. 3. Definition of Incapacity: The amendment leaves the definition of 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office' somewhat vague.

Procedural Hurdles: The process requires the concurrence of the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet, which could be difficult to achieve, especially in a politically divided environment. 5.

Secondly, Joe Biden has shown no public indication of intending to drop out or resign.

This indicates a higher likelihood of action being taken compared to if there were no investigation. 2. Previous Actions by Trump: Donald Trump has been known to make public statements about various investigations and legal proceedings he is involved in, which could potentially be interpreted as witness tampering if they are deemed to influence or intimidate witnesses. Given his past behavior, it's plausible he could act similarly in this case. 3. Legal Definitions and Thresholds: Witness tampering charges require specific legal thresholds to be met, including intent to influence or intimidate a witness. The determination of whether Trump's actions meet these criteria would depend on the specifics of his statements and the context in which they are made. 4. Prosecutorial Discretion: The decision to charge Trump with witness tampering would ultimately rest with the prosecutors handling the case. This decision would be influenced by their assessment of the evidence, the potential impact on the broader case, and possibly political considerations. 5. Timeline: The question specifies a deadline of June 1, 2024.

Historical Performance: Ireland has a rich history in Eurovision, having won the contest a record seven times. However, their performance has been less consistent in recent years. Since the introduction of the semi-final format in 2004, Ireland has qualified for the final roughly half the time. This suggests that while they have the potential to do well, qualification is far from guaranteed. 2. Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the performing artist can significantly impact a country's chances. Without knowing who will represent Ireland in 2024 and what their song will be, it's difficult to assess this factor accurately. However, Ireland has shown the ability to select competitive entries in the past. 3. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geopolitical factors, with countries often voting for their neighbors or countries with cultural ties. Ireland might benefit from votes from the UK and possibly other English-speaking or Western European countries, but this is not a strong guarantee of qualification. 4. Competition: The level of competition in the semi-finals can vary significantly from year to year. Some years see a concentration of strong entries in one semi-final, making it harder for others to qualify. Without knowing the lineup for the semi-finals, it's challenging to assess how tough the competition will be for Ireland. 5. Performance on the Night: The live performance, including staging, vocals, and overall presentation, can greatly impact the outcome. A memorable and well-executed performance can boost a country's chances of qualifying. Considering these factors, it's clear that while Ireland has potential, the outcome is far from certain. Their historical performance suggests a roughly 50% qualification rate in the semi-final era, but without knowing the specifics of their entry, the competition, and how voting patterns will play out, it's hard to deviate significantly from this baseline.

Qualifications and Appeal of Kelly and Shapiro: Both Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro have strong political backgrounds and could bring different strengths to a ticket. Kelly, as a senator and former astronaut, has a national profile and could potentially appeal to a broad audience. Shapiro, as the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, has shown electoral success in a key battleground state and has a strong legal background. Their diverse skill sets make them both viable candidates. 2. Political Landscape: The choice of a running mate often involves strategic considerations about which demographics or states the nominee needs to secure. Kelly could potentially help in Arizona and appeal to independents, while Shapiro might help secure Pennsylvania and appeal to those prioritizing law and order or the environment, given his track record. 3. Reporting and Statements: The prompt mentions that Kelly and Shapiro are the favorites, which implies there has been some reporting or speculation suggesting they are at the top of Harris' list. However, without direct quotes from Harris or her campaign, this is speculative. 4. Historical Context: VP picks can sometimes come as a surprise, despite prior speculation. The decision often reflects a balance of political strategy, personal chemistry with the nominee, and the candidate's own willingness to take the role. Given these considerations, while Kelly and Shapiro are reportedly the favorites, predicting political decisions with certainty is challenging. The decision could hinge on factors not publicly known, such as personal chemistry or strategic considerations that aren't immediately apparent. Therefore, based on the information provided and the inherent unpredictability of political decisions, I would estimate a moderate to high probability that Kamala Harris chooses either Kelly or Shapiro, given their reported status as favorites.

Joe Biden having an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024: It's common for sitting presidents and high-profile political figures to engage in interviews and public appearances. Given the significance of the 2024 election and the ongoing political discourse, it's reasonable to expect that Joe Biden will participate in various interviews and media engagements. However, the specific requirement of a 45+ minute in-person interview on camera is somewhat more particular. While not a certainty, it's plausible that such an opportunity will arise, especially considering the numerous late-night shows, podcasts, and in-depth interview formats available. The probability of this event occurring seems relatively high, given the typical media engagement strategies of political figures. 2. Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This condition is more complex and involves legal and political considerations. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, has rarely been invoked and its application is subject to legal interpretation and challenge. For Donald Trump to be removed or blocked under this clause, there would need to be significant legal action or a definitive court ruling, which is difficult to predict. The process would likely involve substantial legal battles and could extend beyond the specified deadline of July 15, 2024. Given the uncertainties of the legal process and the rarity of the application of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, this event seems less likely than the first condition. Considering both conditions must be met for the question to resolve as YES, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event occurring. While I haven't assigned specific probabilities in the reasoning, based on the analysis: - The first condition seems relatively plausible, given common practices in political media engagement. - The second condition is more improbable due to the legal complexities and the rare application of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Given these considerations, a generous estimate for the combined probability might lean towards the lower end of the spectrum, reflecting the complexity and specificity of both conditions needing to be met."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historically, both Georgia and Malta have had mixed results in Eurovision. Georgia has qualified for the Grand Final a few times since its debut in 2007, with its best result being 9th place in 2010 and 2011. Malta, participating since 1971, has had more success in the past, especially in the 1990s and early 2000s, but its performance has been inconsistent in recent years. The Eurovision Song Contest is known for its unpredictability, with voter preferences shifting significantly from year to year. However, certain patterns, such as the popularity of particular genres or the impact of jury voting versus public voting, can influence outcomes. Both countries need to select entries that are likely to appeal to both the jury and the public. The competition format, including the semi-final allocation draw and the voting system (a combination of jury and public voting), plays a crucial role. Given these considerations, predicting qualification with certainty is challenging without knowing the specific entries for 2024. However, we can make a general assessment based on past performance and the assumption that both countries will strive to select competitive entries. Both Georgia and Malta have the potential to qualify, but given the competitive nature of the contest and their recent track records, it's not a guarantee for either country. If we had to estimate based on historical data and without specific information about their 2024 entries, a cautious approach would be to consider the probability of both qualifying as somewhat lower than the probability of at least one of them qualifying.
