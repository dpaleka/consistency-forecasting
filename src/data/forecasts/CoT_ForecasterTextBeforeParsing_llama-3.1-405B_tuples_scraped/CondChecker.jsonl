Understanding the Scenario: The scenario posits that Joe Biden announces he will not accept the Democratic nomination for the 2024 presidential election. This is a significant event that would undoubtedly shake up the political landscape, particularly within the Democratic Party. 2. Impact on Kamala Harris's Odds: The question specifically asks about the impact of this announcement on Kamala Harris's odds of winning, as predicted by Nate Silver's model. Nate Silver and his team at FiveThirtyEight are renowned for their data-driven analyses of political events, including elections. Their model takes into account a wide array of factors, including polling data, economic indicators, and historical trends. 3. Analyzing the Hypothetical: If Biden were to step aside, several things could happen that might affect Harris's chances: - Reduced Field of Candidates: With Biden out of the race, the field of candidates would narrow, potentially consolidating support around fewer candidates. This could benefit Harris if she is perceived as a strong, viable alternative. - Shift in Voter Sentiment: Voters who were supporting Biden might look for another candidate with similar policy positions or political stature, which could lead some to support Harris. - Increased Visibility and Scrutiny: As a front-runner, Harris would likely face increased media attention and scrutiny, which could either boost her profile positively or negatively, depending on how she handles the increased spotlight. 4. Nate Silver's Model: The model's predictions are based on empirical data and statistical analysis. If there's a significant shift in the political landscape, such as Biden stepping aside, the model would likely adjust to reflect new polling data, changes in voter sentiment, and other relevant factors. 5. Electoral College Probability: The question specifically asks about Harris's Electoral College probability being greater than 46.6% on a specific date after the hypothetical announcement. Given the potential for increased support and visibility for Harris following a Biden withdrawal, it's plausible that her predicted chances could rise. Considering these points, the withdrawal of Joe Biden from the race would likely create a scenario where Kamala Harris could gain more support and visibility, potentially increasing her chances of winning as predicted by Nate Silver's model. However, the exact impact would depend on numerous factors, including how the announcement affects voter sentiment, how Harris handles the increased scrutiny, and how other candidates adjust their strategies in response to Biden's withdrawal. Given the complexity of these factors and the inherent unpredictability of political events, it's challenging to assign a precise probability. However, based on logical analysis, it seems more likely than not that Harris's odds would increase under these circumstances."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c183fd7c-acbc-4998-9fe9-3d2b1e75ade9", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?

Firstly, the resolution criteria specify that the outcome resolves positively if the USA is the unique highest-ranked team at the 2024 Paris Olympics, with ranking determined by the number of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals in that order. This implies that not only must the USA win more Gold medals than Silver, but they must also outperform all other countries in terms of Gold medals and, if necessary, Silver and Bronze medals to break any ties. Historically, the USA has been one of the top-performing countries at the Olympics, often competing closely with China for the top spot. However, the condition of winning more Gold than Silver medals adds an additional layer of complexity. This condition might suggest a particularly strong performance in sports or events where the USA traditionally excels, such as track and field, swimming, and basketball. Nonetheless, the overall ranking can be significantly influenced by a wide range of sports and the distribution of medals across them. Another critical factor is the performance of other strong Olympic teams, especially China, Great Britain, and Russia (or the Russian Olympic Committee, depending on the participation status in 2024). These countries have consistently shown the ability to win a substantial number of Gold medals across various sports. If any of these countries perform exceptionally well in 2024, it could challenge the USA's ability to secure the top spot, even if the USA wins more Gold than Silver medals. Furthermore, the condition does not provide information about the total number of medals or the distribution of medals among other countries. A scenario where the USA wins more Gold than Silver but with a lower total number of medals could potentially place them at a disadvantage if another country achieves a higher total number of Gold medals or significantly outperforms in Silver and Bronze medals. Given these considerations, while winning more Gold than Silver medals is a positive indicator for the USA's Olympic performance, it does not guarantee the top spot. The performance of other countries, the distribution of medals across sports, and the specific events in which the USA excels versus those in which they are weaker will all play crucial roles in determining the final ranking."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "00d0f078-47b5-4d83-abb7-968761de08f6", "title": "Will the USA win more Gold than Silver medals and also top the Olympic Medal Table at the Paris 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This question resolves Yes if both of the following conditions are met: (a) The United States Olympic Team wins more Gold medals than Silver medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics.

He has built a reputation among some Republicans for his outspoken support of conservative causes. However, his actual political experience in terms of holding office or running successful campaigns independently of his father is limited. 2. Potential Competitors: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could include seasoned politicians with more experience, such as governors, senators, and possibly even his father, Donald Trump, if he decides to run again. The presence of strong competitors would naturally decrease Trump Jr.'s chances. 3. Current Political Landscape: The Republican Party is diverse, with factions that might prefer a more traditional conservative candidate over someone closely associated with Trumpism. The party's direction and who it chooses to represent it in 2024 will depend on various factors, including the outcomes of the 2022 midterm elections and the evolving political priorities of its base. 4.

Donald Trump Jr. as a Nominee: As of my last update, Donald Trump Jr. has not officially announced a candidacy for the presidency in 2024. While he is a prominent figure within the Republican Party, largely due to his father's influence, there hasn't been a significant movement or indication that he would be the nominee. The Republican Party has a wide array of potential candidates, and without an official candidacy announcement from Donald Trump Jr., his path to the nomination is speculative. 2. Nikki Haley as a Nominee: Nikki Haley, a former Governor of South Carolina and the United States Ambassador to the United Nations under President Donald Trump, has been considered a potential candidate for the presidency. However, like Donald Trump Jr., without an official announcement of candidacy, her status as a nominee is also speculative. Haley has shown more inclination towards a potential presidential run compared to Trump Jr., but the field is crowded, and the outcome is far from certain. 3. Both as Nominees: The question specifically asks about both Donald Trump Jr. and Nikki Haley being the nominees. Given the traditional structure of U.S. presidential elections, where one candidate is chosen for president and another for vice president, the question seems to imply a ticket with both of them. However, the question's wording is somewhat ambiguous regarding whether it's asking about them as a ticket or simply both being nominated in any capacity. Regardless, the likelihood of the Republican Party selecting both as their nominees, especially considering the lack of official candidacy announcements and the early stage of the election cycle, is low. Given these considerations, the probability that both Donald Trump Jr. and Nikki Haley will be the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election is low, primarily due to the lack of clear candidacy announcements and the highly competitive nature of the Republican primaries."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.03508728614109483, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.011695762047031611, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.21969441955732816, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The presence of Trump, in particular, would significantly alter the dynamics of the race, given his strong base within the party. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has undergone significant shifts in recent years, with a growing divide between more traditional conservatives and those aligned with Trump's brand of populism. Christie's ability to navigate these factions and appeal broadly across the party will be crucial. 4. Recent Activities and Visibility: Christie has maintained a public profile through various means, including media appearances and his role in certain national initiatives. However, his efforts to remain relevant and position himself for a potential presidential run have not garnered significant attention or momentum compared to other potential candidates.

Chris Christie as the Republican Nominee: Chris Christie, the former Governor of New Jersey, has been involved in national politics and has run for the presidency before in 2016. However, his chances of becoming the nominee in 2024 seem slim. The Republican Party has shifted significantly towards Trumpism since 2016, and Christie's more moderate stance might not align well with the current party base. Additionally, Christie has been critical of Trump, which might not bode well for his chances within a party that still largely supports the former president. 2. A Trump Family Member as the Republican Nominee: The possibility of a Trump family member becoming the nominee is more plausible, given the significant influence Donald Trump still holds within the Republican Party. Donald Trump himself has hinted at running again in 2024, and if he does, he has a substantial chance of becoming the nominee due to his strong base support. The chances of his children or wife becoming the nominee are much lower, as none of them have shown the same level of political ambition or popularity as Trump himself. Given these considerations, the likelihood of both Chris Christie and a Trump family member becoming Republican nominees seems low. Christie's chances are slim due to his divergence from the current party direction and his past criticisms of Trump. A Trump family member, specifically Donald Trump, has a higher chance of becoming a nominee, but the combination of both Christie and a Trump family member being nominated is highly unlikely due to the reasons mentioned."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.22680531564993253, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The first condition is that at least 5 Democratic lawmakers must pressure Biden to drop out before July 20. The text indicates that there are already significant concerns among Democrats about Biden's ability to win the election, with two safe-seat members publicly urging him to drop out and drafts of letters circulating that would call on him to end his campaign.

The second condition is that Biden must announce not accepting the nomination before July 15, 2024. This requires a definitive, public, and official announcement from Biden or his campaign stating he will not seek or accept the nomination for another term as President in the 2024 cycle. Given these conditions, the key factors to consider are the level of discontent among Democrats with Biden's candidacy, Biden's willingness to step down, and the timing of these events. There is evident discontent among some Democrats with Biden's candidacy, which could lead to a group of lawmakers urging him to drop out. However, the step from private or even public urging to an official, collective request is significant. Biden has shown a strong commitment to his re-election campaign. Without a dramatic shift in circumstances, it's unlikely he would announce a decision not to accept the nomination before July 15, especially given the proximity to the Democratic National Convention.

First, the control of Chasiv Yar by Russian forces as of June 1, 2024, is a significant piece of information but does not directly relate to U.S. domestic politics or presidential elections. Military developments in Ukraine can influence global politics, international relations, and U.S. foreign policy, but their direct impact on a U.S. president's decision to run for reelection is typically minimal unless the situation escalates to a point where it significantly affects U.S. national security or global stability in a way that directly implicates the president's leadership. Second, a president's decision not to seek reelection is usually based on a variety of factors including personal health, political climate, potential opponents, and the president's own perception of their ability to win and serve another term effectively. While international crises can play a role in these considerations, they are generally not the sole or primary factor unless they have a direct and significant impact on the president's political standing or the country's overall situation. Given the information provided, there is no clear link between Russian control of Chasiv Yar and President Biden's decision on the Democratic nomination. Without additional context suggesting that the situation in Ukraine has a direct and significant bearing on President Biden's decision-making process regarding reelection, it is reasonable to conclude that this factor alone would not be determinative. Therefore, based on the information provided and the general principles of U.S. political decision-making, the probability that Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President, given Russia has control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, is low."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "b9c94f59-ba22-4c05-b417-eb6ee3672846", "title": "Will Russia control Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, and will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Political History and Eligibility: Ahmadinejad, who served as Iran's president from 2005 to 2013, has a history of controversy both within Iran and internationally. His eligibility for another presidential term would depend on the interpretation of Iran's constitutional term limits and the Guardian Council's assessment of his suitability. 2. The Guardian Council's Role and Decision-Making Process: The Guardian Council is a powerful body in Iran responsible for vetting candidates for public office, including the presidency. It operates under the supervision of the Supreme Leader and is known for its conservative leanings. The council's decisions are influenced by the political climate, the preferences of the Supreme Leader, and the perceived loyalty of candidates to the Islamic Republic's principles. 3. Impact of an Israeli Attack on Iranian Politics: An Israeli attack within Iran leading to significant casualties would likely escalate tensions between Iran and Israel, potentially influencing Iranian domestic politics. Such an event could lead to a surge in nationalist sentiment and a desire for a strong, experienced leader who has previously stood firm against Western and Israeli pressures. 4. Ahmadinejad's Stance on Israel and Foreign Policy: Ahmadinejad is known for his hardline stance against Israel and the West, which could make him an attractive candidate in the wake of an Israeli attack. His approval could be seen as a way for Iran to signal its defiance and resilience in the face of external aggression. Considering these factors, the probability of the Guardian Council approving Ahmadinejad as a presidential candidate in the described scenario would depend on how the council weighs the need for a strong, defiant leader against any concerns about Ahmadinejad's past controversies or eligibility. If the council prioritizes a united front against external threats and sees Ahmadinejad as a viable leader for this purpose, his chances of approval could increase. However, predicting the Guardian Council's decisions is inherently uncertain due to the opaque nature of Iranian high politics and the specific considerations that might influence its choices at any given time. Given these considerations, and acknowledging the speculative nature of predicting such outcomes, a cautious estimate might lean towards a higher probability due to the potential for an Israeli attack to shift political priorities in Iran, but it should also reflect the uncertainty and unpredictability of the Guardian Council's decision-making process."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "bdad199d-3980-4053-9987-bd10a5a59042", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Israel carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, and (b) Iran's Guardian Council include Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's name on its list of approved candidates for president of Iran?", "body": "(a) This question resolves **Yes** if, following the date of this question's publication and before May 1, 2024, credible reports indicate that an attack attributed to Israel and occurring within Iran's borders has led to the death of at least five individuals.

Industry Trends and Competition: The AI industry, particularly the segment focused on developing advanced models like those OpenAI and Anthropic are working on, is highly competitive. Companies often follow industry trends and best practices established by their competitors, especially when it comes to transparency and safety. If OpenAI publishes a report, it sets a precedent that could pressure competitors to follow suit to maintain public trust and demonstrate their commitment to safety. 2. Regulatory and Public Pressure: The decision by OpenAI to publish such a report could also be influenced by or influence regulatory bodies and public opinion. If there's a growing demand for transparency in AI safety, and OpenAI's report is well-received, Anthropic might feel compelled to provide similar assurances to stay competitive and avoid regulatory scrutiny. 3. Anthropic's Values and Previous Actions: Anthropic has positioned itself as a company deeply concerned with AI safety and ethics. If they have previously demonstrated a commitment to transparency and external validation, it's more likely they would follow OpenAI's lead, or even preempt it, by publishing their own report. 4. Technical and Financial Feasibility: The ability to conduct and publish such a report also depends on the technical and financial resources available to Anthropic. If they have the necessary resources and have been working on safety aspects of their models, it would be more feasible for them to follow OpenAI's example. Given these considerations, if OpenAI publishes a report, it increases the likelihood that Anthropic would do the same due to competitive pressure, the need for transparency, and the precedent set for the industry.

Both Kelly and Shapiro have the potential to do so, but it's impossible to predict with certainty whether Harris will choose one of them.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's impossible to predict with certainty whether Harris will choose Kelly or Shapiro as her running mate, it's plausible that she will choose one of them if Biden is projected to have a higher probability of winning than Trump on July 19, 2024."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "89af4dbe-7930-4f20-9704-529af6608157", "title": "Will FiveThirtyEight project Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024, and will Kamala Harris choose Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro as her VP pick?", "body": "This question resolves to 'Yes' if both of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden has a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Donald Trump according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for the day of July 19, 2024, as per the blue and red trend lines on https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/; and (b) Kamala Harris announces her pick for running mate being either Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro before August 7, 2024, confirmed by Kamala herself.

However, this decision primarily affects the Democratic party's internal dynamics and might not directly influence the Republican party's choice of nominee. 2. Republican Nomination Process: The Republican party's nomination process is independent of the Democratic party's decisions. Republican candidates will still need to go through the primaries and gather support from their party and voters. 3. Trump Family Influence: The Trump family, particularly Donald Trump, holds considerable influence within the Republican party, especially after his presidency. Donald Trump has shown interest in running for the presidency again and maintains a strong base of support within the party. 4. Potential Republican Candidates: While Donald Trump is a significant figure, other Republican candidates might also vie for the nomination. Their success would depend on various factors, including their campaign strategies, appeal to the Republican base, and ability to raise funds. 5. Melania, Ivanka, Eric, Donald Jr., Tiffany, and Barron Trump's Political Ambitions: As of the last available information, none of these family members have announced or shown significant signs of running for the presidency in 2024. Their involvement would depend on unforeseen developments. Given these considerations, the probability of a Trump family member being the Republican nominee is influenced more by internal Republican party dynamics and less by Joe Biden's decision not to run.

Part (a): The men's 100m dash winning time breaks the Olympic record of 9.63s. The Olympic record in the men's 100m dash is 9.63 seconds, set by Usain Bolt at the 2012 London Olympics. Since then, no one has beaten this record at the Olympics, although the world record has been marginally improved by Christian Coleman and then significantly by Erriyon Knighton and Noah Lyles to 9.48 seconds in recent years. Given the trend of improvements in the 100m dash and the emergence of new talent, it's plausible that the Olympic record could be broken. However, breaking a record at the Olympics requires peak performance at the exact right moment, which is challenging. Therefore, while it's possible, it's not a certainty. Part (b): Individual Neutral Athletes win 15 or more gold medals. 'Individual Neutral Athletes' typically refers to athletes competing under the Olympic flag or a neutral designation due to various reasons such as sanctions against their national Olympic committee. Historically, the number of gold medals won by such athletes has been relatively low, given their limited numbers and the specific circumstances under which they compete. Without specific information on the number of Individual Neutral Athletes participating in the 2024 Olympics and the events they are competing in, it's difficult to accurately predict their medal haul. However, winning 15 or more gold medals would require a significant presence and success across a wide range of sports and events, which seems unlikely based on past performances. To resolve the question as 'Yes,' both conditions must be met. Given the analysis: The probability of the men's 100m dash record being broken is plausible but not certain. Let's assign a generous probability of 0.4 (40%) to this event, considering the factors mentioned. The probability of Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals is low. Without being overly pessimistic, let's assign a probability of 0.1 (10%) to this event, given the historical context and the lack of specific information suggesting a significant change in their competitive fortunes. Assuming independence between these two events (the outcome of one does not affect the other), the combined probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04. The combined probability is calculated based on the analysis of both independent events, considering historical contexts, current trends, and the specific requirements for each condition to be met."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06134444464907096, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.020448148216356987, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.372746414923001, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, let's look at Portugal's history in Eurovision. Portugal has participated in the contest 53 times and has qualified for the Grand Final 43 times, including a win in 2017 with Salvador Sobral's 'Amar Pelos Dois.' However, their qualification record since the introduction of the Semi-finals in 2004 has been mixed, with some years seeing them comfortably qualify and others missing out. Portugal's entries often receive high marks for their artistic and musical qualities, but may not always appeal to the broader audience or juries. Armenia, on the other hand, has participated in Eurovision 13 times and has qualified for the Grand Final 10 times. Their best result was fourth place in 2008 with Sirusho's 'Q\u00e9l\u00e9, Q\u00e9l\u00e9.' Armenia's entries are often a mix of traditional and modern elements, which can appeal to both the public and juries. However, like Portugal, their qualification record is not without its setbacks. The Eurovision Song Contest is known for its unpredictability, and many factors can influence a country's chances of qualifying for the Grand Final. The performance of the artist, the staging, the song's message, and how it resonates with the audience and juries all play crucial roles. Additionally, the competition within each Semi-final can significantly impact a country's chances. Some years see certain Semi-finals being considered stronger or more competitive than others. Given these considerations, predicting with certainty whether both Portugal and Armenia will qualify is challenging. However, based on their past performances and assuming that both countries submit entries that are well-received by the audience and juries, we can estimate a probability. Both countries have shown the ability to produce high-quality entries that appeal to a broad audience. However, the unpredictable nature of the contest, combined with the variable of competition within their respective Semi-finals, means that while there is a reasonable chance both could qualify, it is far from a certainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09368273438087504, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03122757812695835, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4759314708019515, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

A Swimmer Winning the Most Gold Medals: This part of the question focuses on an individual's performance in the swimming events. Swimming is a sport where athletes can compete in multiple events, increasing their chances of winning multiple gold medals. Historically, top swimmers like Michael Phelps have demonstrated the potential for an individual to accumulate a significant number of gold medals in a single Olympics. The Same Nation Winning More Than One Women's Team Sport: This part of the question shifts the focus to team sports and the performance of nations rather than individuals. For the question to resolve as 'Yes,' the same nation that the top swimmer represents must win gold in at least two of the eight women's team sports listed (association football, 3\u00d73 basketball, 5\u00d75 basketball, field hockey, handball, rugby sevens, volleyball, and water polo). Connection Between the Two Events: The key to answering this question lies in understanding that there is no direct causal relationship between a swimmer's success and a nation's success in women's team sports. However, there are indirect connections, such as overall sporting infrastructure, investment in sports, and cultural support for athletes, which can influence both individual and team performances across different sports. Reasoning for the Estimate: Given the lack of a direct causal relationship, one might initially think the probability should be low. However, considering the indirect connections and the fact that nations with strong swimming programs (like the United States, Australia, and Great Britain) also tend to have robust programs in other sports, including women's team sports, suggests a higher probability. These nations have historically performed well in both swimming and various team sports at the Olympics. Estimating the Probability: Given these considerations, the probability that the same nation will win more than one women's team sport if a swimmer wins the most gold medals is not extremely low but is also not a certainty. It is reasonable to assume a moderate to high probability, reflecting the indirect connections between a nation's sporting infrastructure and its athletes' success across different sports."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "78509327-44e4-462b-a8ce-57a83cbb47d5", "title": "Will both of the following occur at the 2024 Paris Olympics: (a) A swimmer wins the most gold medals and (b) The same nation wins more than one women's team sport?", "body": "(a) The question resolves as **Yes** if the athlete with the highest number of 2024 Olympic gold medals competes in the swimming events.\n\n(b) This question resolves as No if women's teams representing eight different National Olympic Committees (NOC) win gold in the eight team sports - association football, 3\u00d73 basketball, 5\u00d75 basketball, field hockey, handball, rugby sevens, volleyball, and water polo.

(a) A swimmer winning the most gold medals: Historically, swimmers have been among the top medal winners at the Olympics, with icons like Michael Phelps holding the record for the most gold medals won by an individual. Swimming offers a wide range of events, increasing the potential for athletes in this sport to accumulate multiple medals. However, other sports such as gymnastics, athletics, and cycling also offer multiple events where athletes can win several medals. Given these points, while it's plausible for a swimmer to win the most gold medals, it's not a certainty due to the competitive nature of the Olympics and the variety of sports and events. (b) The same nation winning more than one women's team sport: Certain nations have traditionally been strong across multiple women's team sports. For example, the United States has been dominant in sports like basketball, soccer, and volleyball. The diversity of sports included (association football, 3\u00d73 basketball, 5\u00d75 basketball, field hockey, handball, rugby sevens, volleyball, and water polo) means that different countries might excel in different areas, but there's still a good chance that at least one nation will be strong enough in two or more sports to win gold. The nature of team sports at the Olympics, with limited spots available for teams to qualify, means that only the strongest teams from each nation are represented, increasing the likelihood of the same nation winning in multiple sports. Considering these factors, it seems likely that at least one nation will win gold in more than one women's team sport. Combining the likelihood of both (a) and (b) occurring requires considering the independence of these events. The outcome of one does not directly influence the other, as they involve different sets of athletes and competitions. Therefore, if we estimate the probability of each event separately, we can multiply those probabilities to find the combined probability. Given the historical dominance of swimmers and the structure of the Olympics, let's estimate the probability of (a) happening as around 0.4 (considering the competition from other sports but acknowledging the advantage swimming has in terms of the number of events). For (b), considering the traditional strengths of certain nations across multiple women's team sports, let's estimate the probability as around 0.7 (reflecting a belief that it's more likely than not, given historical trends and the competitive landscape).

First, let's consider Sha'Carri Richardson's potential to win a gold medal. As of my last update, Richardson is an American track and field athlete who has shown significant promise, particularly in sprint events. Her winning a gold medal is contingent on numerous factors, including her performance, the competition, and the specific events she participates in. However, her success, while indicative of her talent and preparation, does not directly influence the overall medal count of France. Next, we examine the condition for France to place in the top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics, which is based on the total medal count. France's performance in the Olympics is dependent on a wide array of factors, including the strength of its athletes across various disciplines, the quality of the competition, and any strategic or logistical advantages it might have as the host nation. The connection between Richardson's potential gold medal and France's overall standing is tenuous at best. Richardson's success in her events does not directly impact France's chances in other events. The Olympic Games feature a vast array of competitions, and each country's ranking is determined by its cumulative performance across all events. Given this, the probability of France placing in the top 5, conditional on Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal, is largely independent of Richardson's performance. France's placement would be more directly influenced by the overall strength and depth of its Olympic team, as well as the performances of other countries' athletes in their respective events. Therefore, without specific data on the current strengths and weaknesses of France's Olympic team relative to other countries, or any unique advantages France might have as the host nation, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. However, considering the general independence of these events and the broad range of factors influencing a country's total Olympic medal count, a reasonable estimate might lean towards the midpoint, reflecting the lack of direct correlation between Richardson's success and France's overall performance."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "bca828cf-a804-4166-bbef-4d48c5e0eae2", "title": "Will both of the following occur at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games: (a) Sha'Carri Richardson wins a gold medal and (b) France places in the Top 5?", "body": "This question resolves positively if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) Sha'Carri Richardson wins a gold medal in any event during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

Understanding Eurovision Qualification: In the Eurovision Song Contest, countries that are not part of the 'Big Five' (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) must participate in one of two semi-finals. From these semi-finals, a certain number of countries qualify for the Grand Final based on a combination of jury and public voting. 2. Australia's Participation and Qualification: The question posits that Australia, which is not a European country but has been invited to participate in Eurovision since 2015, qualifies for the Grand Final. This indicates that Australia's performance in its respective semi-final was strong enough to secure a spot. 3. Latvia's Participation and Qualification Chances: Latvia has been participating in Eurovision since 2000 with varying degrees of success. The country has qualified for the Grand Final several times but has also failed to qualify in other instances. Given these points, the question essentially asks us to predict Latvia's success in qualifying for the Grand Final, knowing that Australia has already secured a spot. However, these are independent events in many respects. Each country's qualification is determined by its performance relative to others in its semi-final, as voted by both a professional jury and the public. Reasoning: While knowing that Australia qualifies gives us some insight into the competitive landscape of one of the semi-finals, it does not directly impact Latvia's chances unless they are in the same semi-final and even then, the impact is indirect. Latvia's qualification will depend on the quality of its entry, the performance on the night, and how these factors are perceived by voters compared to the other countries in its semi-final. Without specific information about Latvia's entry, the semi-final lineup, or how voting patterns might emerge, we have to consider a broad range of possibilities. Historically, qualification for the Grand Final is competitive, and many factors can influence the outcome. Probability: Given the lack of direct correlation between Australia's and Latvia's qualification and without specific details on Latvia's entry or performance, a moderate probability seems most appropriate. This reflects the general competitiveness of Eurovision qualification without making assumptions about Latvia's specific chances. Therefore, the probability that Latvia also qualifies for the Grand Final, given that Australia qualifies, is around 0.5.

The party generally rallies around its incumbent, and any decision to drop out would be a last resort, considering the potential political fallout and the short time frame to replace him with a viable candidate.

Current Political Landscape: As of the last update in July 2024, several notable figures have been mentioned or have expressed interest in running for the Democratic nomination, including incumbent President Biden, Vice President Harris, Governor Newsom of California, and Governor Whitmer of Michigan. The presence of multiple high-profile candidates typically necessitates debates to allow voters to make informed decisions. 3. Democratic National Committee (DNC) Practices: The DNC has traditionally facilitated debates among its presidential candidates as part of the nomination process. These debates are seen as essential for democratic transparency and for ensuring that the eventual nominee has been vetted through public discourse. 4. Resolution and Debate Timing: Given the resolution date is set just before the 2024 Democratic National Convention, there is ample time for the organization and execution of at least one debate. Debates are usually scheduled well in advance but after it becomes clearer who the serious contenders are, to maximize relevance and public interest. 5. Public and Party Interest: There is likely to be significant interest from both the public and the Democratic party in holding debates. Debates attract media attention, engage voters, and can influence public opinion, all of which are crucial in the lead-up to the convention.

Understanding the Nomination Process: The Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election will be selected by the Republican National Convention. This process typically involves primary elections and caucuses across the United States, where delegates are chosen to represent each state at the convention. The candidate who receives the majority of delegate votes becomes the nominee. 2. Assessing the Candidates: As of the last update, Glenn Youngkin is the Governor of Virginia, and Chris Christie is a former Governor of New Jersey. Both have been mentioned in discussions about potential Republican candidates for the 2024 presidential election. However, the field of potential candidates is wide and includes other prominent figures. 3. The Uniqueness of the Question: The question asks if both Glenn Youngkin and Chris Christie will be the nominees. Given the structure of U.S. presidential elections, this means one would have to be the nominee for President and the other for Vice President. 4. Historical Context and Current Trends: Historically, it's rare for a party's ticket to consist of two individuals who have both been governors and who have both been considered potential presidential candidates in their own right. Additionally, the selection of a vice-presidential candidate often follows the selection of the presidential nominee and is influenced by strategic considerations, such as balancing the ticket geographically or ideologically. 5. Analyzing the Competition: The Republican field for 2024 is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates potentially running. This competition complicates the path for any single candidate to become the nominee, let alone for two specific candidates to both be selected. 6.

Historically, Azerbaijan has had a stronger performance record in Eurovision compared to Lithuania. Azerbaijan has qualified for the Grand Final more consistently and has even won the contest once (in 2011). Lithuania, while having qualified several times, has not achieved the same level of success. Eurovision voting patterns often show bloc voting tendencies, where countries tend to vote for their neighbors or countries with cultural or historical ties. Azerbaijan benefits from votes from the former Soviet bloc and has also exchanged high points with Turkey in the past. Lithuania, being a Baltic country, tends to receive votes from its Baltic neighbors and other Eastern European countries but doesn't have as strong of a voting bloc as Azerbaijan. A crucial factor in qualification is the quality of the song and performance. While this can vary greatly from year to year, Azerbaijan has shown a consistent ability to produce performances that appeal to both the jury and the public. Any changes to the contest format, voting rules, or qualification process could potentially impact a country's chances of qualifying. However, without specific details on any changes for Eurovision 2024, it's difficult to assess how this might affect Azerbaijan's chances relative to Lithuania's qualification. Given these considerations, if Lithuania qualifies for the Grand Final, it suggests that the competition in their semi-final was not too fierce, or Lithuania's entry was particularly strong. However, Azerbaijan's qualification is somewhat independent of Lithuania's performance, given the different voting blocs and preferences at play. Azerbaijan's stronger historical performance and its ability to appeal to a broader range of voters suggest that it has a good chance of qualifying, regardless of Lithuania's fate. Therefore, considering Azerbaijan's historical performance, its ability to garner votes from a broader base, and assuming that the condition of Lithuania qualifying does not negatively impact Azerbaijan's chances, the probability that Azerbaijan also qualifies for the Grand Final is relatively high."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "ae566ed5-1d88-4712-bbc2-3ef8b9094943", "title": "Will both Lithuania and Azerbaijan qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following occur: (a) Lithuania participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, and (b) Azerbaijan participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

The Condition: The question is conditional on there being another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention. Given the nature of U.S. presidential elections, debates are a staple of the nomination process. Therefore, it is highly likely that there will be at least one more debate before the convention, assuming the Democratic party follows traditional practices. 2. Joe Biden Dropping Out: The question then posits that President Joe Biden drops out of the race. While this is speculative, the focus is on the media coverage if such an event were to occur, rather than the likelihood of the event itself. 3. Media Coverage: The core of the question revolves around whether a reliable media outlet would cover the story of Joe Biden dropping out with an unofficial confirmation at least 6 hours before he officially announces it. Major news outlets like the Associated Press, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Reuters, and Washington Post have extensive networks of sources and reporters. Given the significance of a sitting president dropping out of a re-election campaign, it is reasonable to expect that such news would leak and be reported by major outlets quickly. 4. Timing of Media Coverage: The requirement for the coverage to be at least 6 hours in advance of the official announcement is a bit more challenging. However, considering the competitive nature of news reporting and the importance of this story, it's plausible that rumors or unofficial confirmations would circulate among media outlets several hours before an official announcement. Given these considerations, the likelihood of a reliable media outlet covering the story of Joe Biden dropping out of the presidential race at least 6 hours in advance, conditional on there being another debate and him actually dropping out, seems relatively high. This is because the scenario involves a major political event that would attract significant media attention and scrutiny, and such events often lead to leaks and early reporting."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "8fca8bcc-e09b-43f0-b543-e0e63190b4a1", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Another Democratic party presidential debate takes place (b) If Joe Biden drops out, a reliable media outlet covers the story at least 6 hours in advance?", "body": "(a) Resolves YES if there is a debate between potential Democratic nominees (e.g. Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, Biden etc.) prior to the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

Historically, the Republicans Party and the National Rally have had distinct ideologies, with the Republicans generally positioned as a center-right party and the National Rally (formerly the National Front) known for its far-right stance. This ideological divide has typically made formal alliances between the two parties unlikely. However, the evolving nature of French politics, especially in recent years, has shown that parties are willing to form alliances to achieve electoral success or to block opponents. Recent trends and statements from party leaders would be crucial in assessing the likelihood of such an alliance. However, without specific information on current negotiations or public statements from the parties involved, we must rely on general trends and the political calculus that might drive such a decision. The Republicans Party has been facing challenges in maintaining its relevance and electoral base, given the rise of President Emmanuel Macron's La R\u00e9publique En Marche! and the increasing popularity of far-right and far-left parties. The National Rally, under Marine Le Pen, has sought to expand its appeal and detoxify its image to attract a broader electorate. An alliance could potentially benefit both parties by pooling their resources and electoral bases to challenge Macron's party and other opponents more effectively. However, any such alliance would also come with risks, including alienating moderate voters who might view the National Rally's ideology as too extreme. The parties would need to weigh these risks against the potential benefits of cooperation.

This alliance needs to be officially announced before June 30, 2024. 2.

If the condition is not met, the question resolves as N/A. Analysis: - The formation of an alliance between the Republicans Party and the National Rally would indicate a significant shift in the French political landscape, suggesting that these parties are looking to challenge the dominance of the New Popular Front and Together coalitions. - If such an alliance is formed and is successful in the legislative election, it could potentially lead to the Prime Minister of France belonging to this new coalition, assuming they secure a majority or significant enough presence in the National Assembly to influence the appointment of the Prime Minister. - However, the French political system is complex, and the appointment of the Prime Minister is made by the President, taking into account the majority or the coalition with the most seats in the National Assembly. Therefore, even if the Republicans Party and National Rally form an alliance and gain a significant number of seats, the President's discretion and the exact composition of the National Assembly after the election would play crucial roles in determining the Prime Minister's party affiliation. Probability Estimate: Given the condition that the Republicans Party of France forms an alliance with the National Rally, and considering the complexities of French politics and the factors that influence the appointment of the Prime Minister, I would estimate the probability of the Prime Minister belonging to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024, as follows: Probability: 0.6 This estimate reflects the potential impact of the alliance on the political landscape and the appointment of the Prime Minister, while also acknowledging the uncertainties and complexities involved in French politics."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "014fcbe6-a240-4f1d-a876-09bcadaef020", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The Republicans Party of France (Les R\u00e9publicains) forms a political alliance with the National Rally for the 2024 French legislative election (b) The Prime Minister of France belongs to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if both of the following are true: (a) Before June 30, 2024, an electoral alliance or coalition agreement is officially announced between the Republicans Party (Les R\u00e9publicains) and National Rally (Rassemblement National) for the upcoming French legislative election, according to credible sources.

Ted Cruz has a significant political history, having been a runner-up in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. He has maintained a strong conservative stance and has a solid base of supporters within the Republican Party. However, the Republican Party's landscape has evolved since 2016, with new figures emerging and some shifts in party priorities and voter preferences. As of my last update, several other prominent Republicans have expressed interest or are rumored to be considering a run for the 2024 nomination, including former President Donald Trump, who, if he decides to run, could significantly alter the dynamics of the race given his strong base within the party. Other potential candidates could also affect Cruz's chances, depending on how the field shapes up and how Cruz positions himself in relation to these competitors. Cruz's nomination would depend on his ability to appeal to a broad spectrum of Republican voters and delegates beyond his conservative base. The Republican National Convention's selection process involves delegates from each state, and winning the nomination typically requires a candidate to demonstrate wide appeal and build a strong campaign infrastructure across multiple states. Given these considerations, while Ted Cruz has a dedicated base and significant political experience, the competition for the Republican nomination is expected to be fierce, with multiple candidates vying for the top spot.

Ted Cruz's Nomination Impact: The condition assumes Ted Cruz is selected as the Republican nominee. This could influence Biden's decision, but only if Cruz's nomination significantly alters the political landscape in a way that impacts Biden's chances or strategic considerations. Cruz is considered a conservative candidate, and his nomination might be seen as more favorable to Democratic chances than a more moderate Republican. However, this alone might not directly influence Biden's decision to run. 2. Joe Biden's Intentions and Health: As of my last update, Joe Biden has indicated intentions to run for re-election. However, his decision could be influenced by personal health considerations, political climate, and the Democratic Party's internal dynamics. The condition does not directly relate to these factors, but they are crucial in determining whether Biden would choose not to accept the nomination. 3. Democratic Party Dynamics: The decision of the incumbent President not to seek re-election would significantly impact the Democratic Party's nomination process. It would open up the field to various candidates. However, this decision is more likely to be influenced by internal party dynamics, Biden's own political and personal considerations, and the broader political climate rather than the specific opponent. 4.

(a) Ted Cruz being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of my last update, the Republican field for the 2024 election is wide open, with several potential candidates, including but not limited to Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley, among others. Ted Cruz has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, especially after his 2016 presidential run. However, his popularity and influence within the party have seen fluctuations. The Republican Party's nomination process involves primary elections and caucuses, culminating in the Republican National Convention, where delegates officially select the party's nominee. The outcome can be influenced by numerous factors, including the candidates' campaign strategies, fundraising capabilities, and national and international events that may impact public opinion. Given the competitive nature of the Republican primaries and the presence of other strong contenders, the likelihood of Ted Cruz securing the nomination might be considered moderate at best, especially if other prominent figures like Trump or DeSantis decide to run. (b) Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President: President Biden's decision to seek re-election or step aside would be influenced by various factors, including his health, approval ratings, the state of the economy, and the political landscape heading into the 2024 election cycle. As of my last update, President Biden has indicated intentions to seek re-election but has also left room for changing circumstances. The Democratic Party would be closely watching his performance and public perception, considering the implications of his candidacy on their electoral prospects. The likelihood of President Biden making an early definitive statement about not accepting the nomination seems low, given the strategic nature of such announcements and the fluidity of political situations. Considering both scenarios: The two events are somewhat independent in that one does not directly influence the other. However, the broader political context could indirectly affect both. For instance, if the Democratic Party appears weak or divided, it might embolden Republican contenders, potentially affecting their nomination process and vice versa. Given the complexities and uncertainties in both scenarios, estimating the combined probability requires a nuanced approach. However, without direct correlation, we can consider multiplying the individual probabilities as a rough estimate. Individual probabilities are subjective and based on the information available up to my last update. Let's hypothetically assign a moderate probability for Ted Cruz's nomination, considering the competitive field (let's say around 0.2 for illustrative purposes), and a lower probability for Joe Biden's early announcement to not seek re-election (let's say around 0.1, given his indications to run and the strategic nature of such announcements). Reasoning: The combined probability, assuming independence, would be the product of the two probabilities (0.2 * 0.1 = 0.02). However, this is a simplified calculation and should be taken as a rough estimate rather than a precise prediction, given the complexities and uncertainties involved."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.01540468188620548, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This recent success indicates a positive trend in the quality of entries and the country's approach to the contest. 2. Song Quality and Selection Process: The Netherlands often uses a national selection process to choose its Eurovision entry, which can involve either a public vote, a jury, or a combination of both. This process has yielded successful results in the past, particularly when the selected songs have resonated with both the Dutch public and international audiences. The quality of the song, its production, and its appeal to a broad audience are crucial factors in determining success at Eurovision. 3.

Interest in the Market: The market's subject is a significant political event, which tends to attract a lot of interest and speculation. The choice of a running mate by a major presidential candidate is a highly watched and analyzed event. 2. Timing: The market's resolution is tied to an event (the announcement of a running mate) that is expected to happen before August 7th, but the specific market in question (about reaching 377 traders) resolves by July 15. This means there's a time constraint that could impact the outcome, as the announcement needs to happen early enough to influence trader participation before July 15. 3. Publicity and Awareness: The more publicized the market and the event it's based on, the more likely it is to attract traders. Given the nature of the event (a significant political announcement), it's reasonable to expect a fair amount of publicity. 4. Engagement on the Platform: The level of engagement on the Manifold Markets platform can also affect the outcome. If the platform is experiencing high levels of activity or if similar markets have been popular, this could increase the likelihood of reaching the trader threshold. 5. Conditional Nature: The question is conditional on Kamala Harris picking either Kelly or Shapiro. This adds a layer of uncertainty because if she picks someone else, the condition isn't met, and the outcome of the market (in terms of reaching 377 traders) becomes moot for the purposes of this question. Given these considerations, we can reason that: - There is likely to be significant interest in the market due to its political nature. - The timing constraint means the announcement needs to happen relatively quickly to influence the market outcome by July 15. - Publicity and platform engagement are likely to be high, given the nature of the event. However, the conditional nature of the question introduces significant uncertainty because it hinges on a specific choice by Kamala Harris. Considering these factors, it seems plausible that if Kamala Harris picks either Kelly or Shapiro, the market could attract a substantial number of traders due to the high interest in the event. However, the conditional nature and the timing constraints introduce elements of uncertainty."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "f8f5e11d-4232-469e-9120-d83c12f31f6b", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Kamala Harris' VP Pick be either Kelly or Shapiro (b) The linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15?", "body": "(a) The two favorites for Kamala\u2019s running mate are currently Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro.

Understanding Core CPI: The Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of inflation that excludes the volatile food and energy components. It's used to gauge the underlying inflation trend in the economy. 2. Seasonal Adjustment: The question specifies the use of seasonally adjusted data. Seasonal adjustment is a statistical method used to remove the seasonal component of a time series, allowing for a clearer understanding of the underlying trend. 3. Recent Trends and Economic Conditions: As of my last update in early 2024, the global economy, including the US, has been experiencing a period of inflation driven by various factors such as supply chain disruptions, monetary policy responses to the pandemic, and geopolitical tensions. However, central banks, including the Federal Reserve in the US, have been actively working to combat inflation through monetary policy adjustments, such as raising interest rates. 4. Predicting Future CPI Movements: Predicting the exact movement of CPI is challenging due to its dependence on numerous variables, including consumer behavior, supply chain dynamics, and policy interventions. However, given the efforts to curb inflation, there might be a tendency towards stabilization or a decrease in the rate of inflation. 5. Specific Threshold of 0.1% Increase: The question asks about an increase of more than 0.1% in the Core CPI from June to July 2024. Given the efforts to control inflation and assuming no major disruptions that could significantly push prices up, a moderate increase or stabilization could be expected. Considering these points, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting, it seems plausible that the increase could be around or below the specified threshold, given the broader context of inflation control measures. However, without specific data on recent economic indicators, supply chain conditions, and how they might affect the Core CPI, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction. Therefore, my reasoning leads me to believe that while there's a possibility of the Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1%, it's not overly likely given the current economic climate and efforts to curb inflation."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "cca39848-7968-4a60-b3b3-2599bc44222a", "title": "Given the US Core CPI increases by more than 0.1% in July, will Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The seasonally adjusted Core CPI for July 2024 increases by more than 0.1% compared to June 2024.

However, their qualification record is not consistent, indicating a variable level of success. 2. Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the performance of the artist are crucial factors in Eurovision success. Without knowing who will represent Georgia in 2024 and what their song will be, it's difficult to assess their chances based on this criterion. 3. Competition: Eurovision is highly competitive, with over 30 countries participating in the semi-finals vying for a spot in the Grand Final. The competition's intensity means that qualification is never guaranteed, even for countries with a strong Eurovision history. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by various factors, including cultural and geographical alliances. Georgia might benefit from votes from neighboring or culturally aligned countries, but this is not a reliable predictor of success. 5. Recent Trends: In recent years, Eurovision has shown a preference for certain types of songs and performances, such as those with a strong message, unique staging, or a blend of traditional and modern elements. If Georgia's entry aligns with these trends, it might have a better chance of qualifying. Given these considerations, predicting Georgia's qualification with certainty is challenging.

However, past performance is not always a reliable indicator of future success, as many factors can influence a country's chances. Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical, cultural, and political factors, but these influences can vary year to year. The quality of the song and performance are crucial, and without specific information about the entries for 2024, this remains a wild card. Given these considerations, while there is some historical basis to suggest Estonia might have a slightly better chance of qualifying than Georgia, the qualification of one does not directly influence the chances of the other. Therefore, we can say that Estonia's chances of qualifying are somewhat independent of Georgia's qualification, and based on historical data, Estonia might have a slightly higher chance of qualifying overall.

Francis Suarez as the Republican Nominee: As of my last update, Francis Suarez, the current Mayor of Miami, has not been a leading figure in national Republican politics compared to other potential candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley. While Suarez has gained some national attention for his leadership in Miami and his Cuban-American background, which could appeal to certain demographics within the Republican Party, his path to the nomination seems challenging. The Republican nomination process tends to favor candidates with higher national profiles, stronger fundraising capabilities, and broader party support. Therefore, without significant shifts in the political landscape or Suarez gaining substantial momentum, his chances of becoming the nominee appear slim. 2. FiveThirtyEight Projecting Biden as the Favorite: As of my last update, it's too early to predict with certainty how the 2024 election will unfold, including how FiveThirtyEight's models will project the outcome in July 2024. However, we can consider some general trends and factors. Joe Biden, as the incumbent president (assuming he runs for re-election), might have an advantage in terms of name recognition and the power of incumbency. However, his approval ratings and the overall political climate will significantly influence his chances. FiveThirtyEight's projections take into account a wide range of data, including polls, economic indicators, and historical trends. If the economy is performing well and Biden maintains decent approval ratings, it's plausible that FiveThirtyEight could project him as the favorite. However, this is highly speculative and subject to numerous variables, including the identity of the Republican nominee and unforeseen events. Considering these factors, the likelihood of both conditions being met (Suarez being the nominee and Biden being projected as the favorite) seems low, primarily due to the improbability of Suarez securing the Republican nomination. While it's difficult to assign a precise probability to such a specific and contingent outcome, my reasoning suggests that the probability should be on the lower end of the spectrum."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.06655508048242492, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

He has hosted Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News since 2016, where he has developed a significant following and influence within conservative circles. However, unlike many potential candidates, Carlson does not have direct political experience, which could be a disadvantage in securing the nomination. Carlson has a strong base of support among conservative voters, largely due to his nightly show's high ratings and his outspoken views on various issues. His ability to influence public opinion and his strong media presence could be significant assets in a nomination contest. The Republican Party is currently navigating its post-Trump era, with several figures vying for influence and potential candidacy for the 2024 election. The field is expected to be crowded, with potential candidates including former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, various senators, governors, and other political figures. Carlson's lack of political experience might make it difficult for him to stand out in a crowded field of more seasoned politicians. As of my last update, Tucker Carlson has not announced any intention to run for the presidency. While his influence within conservative media is significant, the step from media personality to presidential candidate is substantial and would require a formal announcement and significant campaign infrastructure.

There are two possible scenarios where the question resolves to YES: (1) ISS advises against Elon Musk's $57 billion package, or (2) ISS advises against the re-election of Kimbal Musk. First, let's consider the likelihood of ISS advising against Elon Musk's pay package. ISS has a history of scrutinizing executive compensation, and a $57 billion package is certainly a significant amount. However, ISS's recommendations are based on a variety of factors, including the company's performance, industry standards, and shareholder value. Without more information about Tesla's performance and the details of the pay package, it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of ISS advising against it. Next, let's consider the likelihood of ISS advising against the re-election of Kimbal Musk. ISS typically evaluates board members based on their independence, expertise, and alignment with shareholder interests. Kimbal Musk is Elon Musk's brother and a member of Tesla's board of directors. While ISS may view his family relationship as a potential conflict of interest, it's unclear whether this would be sufficient to warrant a recommendation against his re-election. Given the uncertainty surrounding both scenarios, I will rely on general trends and ISS's historical behavior. ISS tends to be cautious and conservative in its recommendations, often favoring the status quo. However, ISS also aims to promote good governance and protect shareholder interests. Assuming the linked market reaches 377 traders by the end of July 15, I estimate the probability of ISS advising against Elon Musk's pay package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk as follows: Probability: 0.35. This estimate reflects my uncertainty about the specifics of the pay package and Kimbal Musk's performance as a board member, as well as ISS's general tendency to be cautious in its recommendations. However, it also acknowledges the possibility that ISS may take a more critical stance on executive compensation or board composition, especially given the large size of the pay package and the potential conflict of interest with Kimbal Musk's family relationship."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "2b19bc80-6e51-4b91-a367-90caae28ef68", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, and (b) ISS advises Tesla shareholders to vote against either Elon Musk's $57 billion package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk?", "body": "(a) Resolves YES if the market embedded in the following link has 377 traders before market close (July 15, 11:59 PM Pacific Time): https://manifold.markets/embed/Mira_/how-many-traders-will-this-market-g.

Health and Capacity of President Biden: As of the last public information available, President Biden has shown no clear signs of incapacitation that would warrant the invocation of the 25th Amendment. While his age and occasional public gaffes might raise concerns for some, these do not constitute clear evidence of an inability to discharge his duties. 4. Process and Threshold for Invocation: The process requires the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or another relevant body) to agree on the President's incapacitation. This is a high threshold, especially considering the political and institutional implications of such a decision. Given these considerations, the likelihood of President Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August appears low. There is no clear indication of incapacitation that would meet the high threshold required for such action, and the political climate, while tense, does not seem conducive to the broad support needed from the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "da247c6e-dc44-45a6-ba5a-4e82467ced40", "title": "Given Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August, will he die before Saturday?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time).

Regarding the first event, the invocation of the 25th Amendment Section 4 is a rare and significant political action that requires the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to agree that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. This is not a common occurrence and usually requires severe physical or mental incapacitation of the President.

Condition (a) pertains to Nvidia's market capitalization being larger than Apple's on July 17, 2024. As of my last update, Nvidia and Apple are among the largest companies in the world by market capitalization, with their market caps fluctuating due to various factors including stock performance, financial reports, and broader economic conditions. Given the dynamic nature of the stock market, predicting which company will have a larger market cap on a specific date in the future involves considerable uncertainty. However, Nvidia's growth in the AI and tech sectors has been significant, and if this trend continues, it's plausible that Nvidia could surpass Apple in market capitalization. Yet, this is highly speculative and subject to numerous variables. Condition (b) involves Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal or state office. The application of this clause to Donald Trump would require significant legal and political developments, including a determination that his actions constituted insurrection or rebellion. Given the political and legal complexities involved, this outcome is uncertain but seems unlikely given the high threshold for such actions and the political polarization around Trump. Given these considerations, the likelihood of both conditions being met seems low. Condition (a) is uncertain due to market volatility and the inherent difficulty in predicting future market capitalizations. Condition (b) is also uncertain but leans towards being unlikely due to the significant legal and political hurdles involved in applying Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to a major political figure like Donald Trump.

Brokered Convention Scenario: The premise is that the Democratic Party has a brokered convention, meaning no candidate achieves a majority of the delegates' votes in the first round, necessitating subsequent rounds of voting. This situation implies a level of division or indecision within the party regarding their nominee. 2. Call for Biden to Drop Out: The question specifically asks if 10 or more Democratic Senators will call for President Biden to drop out of the race before July 20, given the brokered convention scenario. Reasoning: - Brokered Convention Implications: A brokered convention suggests significant internal party debate or conflict, which could lead to calls for a change in leadership or a reevaluation of candidates. However, this scenario doesn't directly imply that the calls for change would specifically target Biden or be widespread among Democratic Senators. - Senator Loyalty and Party Dynamics: Democratic Senators generally align closely with the party's leadership and platform. Publicly calling for the incumbent President from their own party to drop out would be a significant step, potentially seen as disloyal or divisive. Such actions are typically rare and reserved for extreme circumstances. - Timing and Resolution Criteria: The resolution criteria specify that the calls for Biden to drop out must occur before July 20, which is relatively early in the context of the general election timeline. This timeframe limits the window for significant shifts in party support or senatorial opinion. - Public Statements vs. Private Sentiments: Senators might privately wish for a different candidate but be reluctant to express this publicly due to party loyalty, strategic considerations, or fear of backlash. Conclusion: Given the considerations above, while a brokered convention indicates party division, it's unlikely that a substantial number of Democratic Senators would publicly call for Biden to drop out.

The 2020 Tokyo Olympics saw a total of 24 world records broken across all sports. 2. Athlete and Sports Development: The continuous improvement in athlete training methods, technology, and sports equipment increases the likelihood of record-breaking performances. Additionally, the introduction of new events and the inclusion of more countries and athletes can lead to a higher number of records being broken. 3. Competition Environment: The environment in which athletes compete can significantly impact performance. Factors such as weather conditions, crowd support, and the quality of the competition venues can all contribute to record-breaking performances. 4. World Record Progression: The progression of world records over time suggests that as athletes get closer to the human performance limit, records become harder to break. However, this does not necessarily mean that fewer records will be broken, as the margin for improvement may be smaller, but the number of athletes capable of achieving these improvements could increase. Considering these factors, while it's difficult to predict the exact number of world records that will be broken, the trend from previous Olympics suggests that it's plausible for at least 24 world records to be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics, especially given the advancements in training, technology, and the competitive environment."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "741cf902-3104-4a11-b6ec-e2df8633f8a8", "title": "Conditional on at least 24 world records being broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics, will France place in the Top 5?", "body": "This question explores the relationship between the number of world records broken and France's performance at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nSuppose the following is true: At least 24 world records are broken during the 2024 Paris Olympics.

To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between Joe Biden's announcement and the US government's decision to terminate the agreement with Verisign. Firstly, it's essential to note that the Cooperative Agreement between the US Department of Commerce and Verisign is a long-standing agreement that has been in place since 1998. The agreement has been renewed and updated several times, with the most recent renewal occurring in 2018. The agreement governs the management of the .com TLD, which is one of the most widely used top-level domains globally. Given the significance of the .com TLD and the long-standing nature of the agreement, it's unlikely that the US government would terminate the agreement without a compelling reason. Joe Biden's announcement that he will not accept the Democratic nomination does not appear to be directly related to the management of the .com TLD or the Cooperative Agreement with Verisign. There is no clear indication that the US government would use Joe Biden's announcement as a reason to terminate the agreement with Verisign.

Song and Artist Quality: The quality and appeal of the song and artist selected by Malta for Eurovision 2024 will significantly impact their chances. A catchy, well-performed song that resonates with the audience and jurors can greatly enhance their qualification prospects. 3. Competition: The level of competition in the semi-final Malta is assigned to will also affect their chances. Some semi-finals are more competitive than others, depending on the participating countries and their entries. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geopolitical factors, cultural affinity, and diaspora voting. Malta might benefit or suffer from these patterns depending on the countries voting in their semi-final and the Grand Final. 5. Performance and Staging: The live performance, including staging, choreography, and how well the artist connects with the audience, plays a crucial role. A memorable and impactful performance can boost a country's chances of qualifying. Given these factors, without specific information on Malta's entry for Eurovision 2024, the competition in their assigned semi-final, and considering the unpredictable nature of Eurovision voting, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. However, we can look at general trends: - Historically, Malta has had a somewhat consistent qualification rate, though not among the highest. - The quality of the song and performance can significantly sway the outcome, but without knowing the 2024 entry, we must consider a wide range of possibilities. - Voting patterns can be unpredictable but generally favor countries with strong diaspora support or geopolitical alliances, which can sometimes work in Malta's favor.

Malta has qualified for the Grand Final more consistently than Cyprus, but both countries have had their share of successes and failures. 2. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting patterns can be influenced by geographical, cultural, and political factors. Countries often tend to vote for their neighbors or countries with which they share cultural ties. However, since both Malta and Cyprus are island nations in the Mediterranean with their own unique cultural identities, their voting patterns might not directly correlate with each other's success. 3. Song Quality and Performance: The quality of the song and the performance on the night of the semi-final play a significant role in determining qualification. A strong song and performance can significantly increase a country's chances of qualifying, regardless of past performances. 4. Competition in the Semi-final: The level of competition in the semi-final that Cyprus participates in will also be a crucial factor. If Cyprus is in a semi-final with several strong contenders, its chances of qualifying might be lower compared to being in a semi-final with fewer strong contenders. 5. Given Condition (Malta Qualifying): The condition that Malta has qualified might suggest a favorable voting environment for countries that might be considered similar in some aspects (e.g., Mediterranean countries), but this is a weak indicator at best, as each country's performance is evaluated independently.

However, the landscape of international basketball has changed over the years, with many countries improving significantly. For the men's team, countries like Australia, Spain, and Serbia have shown they can compete at a high level. For the women's team, countries like Australia, Spain, and Belgium have been strong competitors. Despite this, the depth of talent available to the United States, the strength of their leagues (notably the NBA and WNBA), and their investment in basketball development programs give them a significant advantage. Additionally, the U.S. basketball teams have a strong tradition of rising to the challenge in major international competitions, often displaying a level of cohesion and individual talent that is hard for other countries to match.

Interest in the Election: The 2024 U.S. presidential election is a highly significant and closely watched event, both domestically and internationally. The interest in this event is naturally high, which tends to attract more traders to markets related to election outcomes. 2. Volatility and Uncertainty: A lead by Trump over Biden, especially within the specified margin, could introduce significant volatility and uncertainty into the market. Such conditions often attract traders who seek to capitalize on potential swings in market sentiment. 3. Market Awareness: The condition specified (Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4) might not be widely known or closely followed by the general public. However, for those engaged in political betting or closely following election polls, this could serve as a specific and intriguing condition to bet on, potentially increasing interest. 4.

If the condition specified seems plausible or likely to a significant portion of potential traders, this could increase participation. Considering these factors, it seems plausible that a market linked to such a specific and potentially volatile condition related to a major event could attract a significant number of traders. The specificity of the condition (Trump's lead being within a certain margin) adds an element of intrigue that could attract traders looking to capitalize on their beliefs about the election's direction. However, predicting the exact number of traders (at least 377) involves a high degree of uncertainty. It depends on the visibility of the market, the awareness and interest of potential traders in this specific condition, and their willingness to participate within the given timeframe.

Eurovision is known for its unpredictability, with outcomes influenced by a mix of factors including song quality, performance, staging, and voting patterns (both jury and public). However, certain countries have historically shown a stronger consistency in qualifying for the Grand Final. Norway has had a mixed record in qualifying for the Grand Final, with some years seeing successful qualifications and others not. Switzerland, on the other hand, has shown a resurgence in success in recent years, particularly with their qualification and high placement in the 2019 contest, breaking a four-year non-qualification streak. Since then, they have maintained a relatively good track record. Given these patterns, while it's challenging to predict with certainty without knowing the 2024 entries and performances, we can consider that both countries have the potential to qualify based on past performances.

The 14th Amendment's Section 3, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal or state office. To answer this question, we need to consider the likelihood of Trump being removed or blocked from a primary ballot under this clause. Firstly, it's essential to note that the condition of Russia controlling Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, is unrelated to Trump's potential removal from a primary ballot. This condition seems to be a red herring, and we should focus on the likelihood of Trump being removed due to his actions or behavior. Trump has been involved in several controversies and lawsuits throughout his career, but being removed from a primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is a specific and severe consequence. For this to happen, there would need to be significant evidence of Trump engaging in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. While Trump has been accused of various wrongdoings, including inciting violence and undermining democratic institutions, it's uncertain whether these actions would meet the threshold for removal under the 14th Amendment. Moreover, the process of removing someone from a primary ballot is typically done at the state level, and it's unclear which state would take such action. Given the lack of clear evidence and the uncertainty surrounding the application of the 14th Amendment, it's unlikely that Trump would be removed or blocked from a primary ballot under Section 3.

Current Trends: As of my last update, I don't have real-time data, but I can suggest that the trends in polling averages can fluctuate based on numerous factors including recent political events, economic conditions, and public relations efforts by both campaigns. 2. Historical Context: Polling averages can be volatile, and a lead of any size can change rapidly due to the aforementioned factors. Historically, leads in presidential races have fluctuated significantly as the election approaches. 3. Margin of Error: Most polls have a margin of error, typically around 3-4%. This means that even if a candidate is leading by 2-3 points, they could potentially be tied or even trailing slightly in reality due to this margin of error. 4. Undecided Voters: The number of undecided voters can also impact the polling averages. If a significant portion of voters remains undecided, the lead could shift as these voters make their decisions. 5. Polling Methodology: Different polling organizations may use different methodologies, which can affect the results. Some might use landlines, cell phones, online surveys, or a combination, and each method can yield different results. 6. FiveThirtyEight's Model: FiveThirtyEight (538) uses a sophisticated model that adjusts for various factors, including the pollster's track record, the type of poll (e.g., IVR, online, live interviewer), and the sample size. Their model tends to be more stable than individual polls but can still show fluctuations. Given these considerations, predicting a specific range for Trump's lead over Biden on a particular date is challenging. The range specified (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) is narrow, and given the volatility of polling averages, it's difficult to confidently predict such a precise outcome.

Event 1: The Pandemic Agreement is approved at the May 2024 World Health Assembly. The Pandemic Agreement is a global health initiative aimed at improving pandemic preparedness and response. While the text does not provide specific details about the agreement's content or the voting process at the World Health Assembly (WHA), we can make an educated guess based on general trends. The WHA is the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), and its member states usually strive for consensus on key issues. However, the approval of a major agreement like this might face some opposition or require further negotiations. Given the importance of global cooperation in addressing pandemics and the likely thorough preparation of the agreement, I estimate the probability of the Pandemic Agreement being approved at the May 2024 WHA as moderately high. Event 2: OpenAI publicly commits to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle before July 1, 2024. This event involves a specific company, OpenAI, publicly endorsing a principle that promotes transparency and accountability in AI development. The principle in question is advocated by the righttowarn.ai initiative, which suggests that there might be some pressure or expectation for OpenAI to adopt this stance. OpenAI has been at the forefront of AI research and has demonstrated a willingness to engage in public discussions about AI ethics and safety. Given the growing importance of AI governance and the potential benefits of committing to transparency, I estimate the probability of OpenAI publicly endorsing the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle as fairly high. However, it's essential to note that this event requires a specific action from OpenAI before a specified deadline, which introduces some uncertainty. Combining the probabilities: To estimate the probability of both events occurring, we need to multiply the individual probabilities. Based on my assessments: The probability of the Pandemic Agreement being approved at the May 2024 WHA is around 0.7 (moderately high). The probability of OpenAI publicly committing to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle before July 1, 2024, is around 0.8 (fairly high). Therefore, the combined probability would be: 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56. Reasoning: The combined probability reflects the challenges in predicting the outcomes of two distinct events, each with its own set of uncertainties. While both events are plausible and align with broader trends in global health cooperation and AI ethics, their specific outcomes depend on numerous factors, including the actions of individuals and organizations."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.010629391961201273, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.003543130653733758, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1569438348334373, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Joe Biden's Announcement: The premise is based on Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024. This is a significant event because it would suddenly create a power vacuum within the Democratic Party, as Biden is the incumbent president and would presumably be the front-runner for the nomination if he chose to run. 2. Need for a Debate: If Biden were to step aside, the Democratic Party would need to quickly organize to find a new nominee. Given the structure of U.S. presidential elections, debates are a crucial part of the nomination process. They allow candidates to present their policies, personalities, and leadership styles to the public and party delegates. Without an incumbent president seeking re-election, the need for debates to help choose a nominee would become more pressing. 3. Democratic Party's Response: The Democratic Party would likely move swiftly to ensure a fair and transparent process for selecting a new nominee. This would involve setting up debates among the potential candidates to help voters and delegates make informed decisions. The party has an interest in ensuring that the eventual nominee is both legitimate in the eyes of the voters and capable of winning the general election. 4. Precedent and Timing: Historically, debates have been an integral part of the nomination process for both major parties. Given the relatively short timeframe between July 15, 2024, and the Democratic National Convention (scheduled for August 2024), the party would likely prioritize organizing debates to expedite the nomination process. Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that if Joe Biden were to announce he would not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024, there would indeed be a strong likelihood of another Democratic party presidential debate. The party's need to find a new nominee, the importance of debates in the U.S. electoral process, and the precedent set by previous nomination contests all support this conclusion."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "4b7fe964-309f-4518-a34a-f61f16a65d7b", "title": "Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President, and will there be another Democratic party presidential debate?", "body": "(1) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nThis resolves as Yes if, before 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement that he will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.

IMDB Rating of 'House of the Dragon' S2E7: The question posits that the episode receives a rating greater than 8.5 on IMDB two days after its release. The IMDB rating is a user-generated score, and a rating above 8.5 indicates a very positive reception from the audience. The show's popularity and the quality of the episode can influence this rating. 2. Number of Traders in the Linked Market: The question asks whether the linked market will have at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, given the condition about the IMDB rating. The number of traders in a market can be influenced by the market's visibility, the interest in the subject matter (in this case, 'House of the Dragon' and its performance), and the perceived potential for profit based on the market's rules and the underlying event (the IMDB rating). Connection between IMDB Rating and Market Participation: A high IMDB rating for 'House of the Dragon' S2E7 could indicate strong fan engagement and positive sentiment, which might attract more traders to participate in markets related to the show. If the episode is well-received, it could increase interest in betting on or trading related outcomes, potentially increasing the number of traders in the linked market. However, the specific number of 377 traders by July 15 is arbitrary and not directly correlated with the IMDB rating mechanism. Market participation is also influenced by factors unrelated to the show's quality or popularity, such as market liquidity, the presence of other attractive trading opportunities, and external economic conditions. Reasoning: Given the indirect relationship between the IMDB rating of a TV episode and the number of traders in a specific market, predicting the exact number of traders based on the episode's rating is challenging. While a high rating might increase interest in the show and potentially in related trading markets, it does not directly translate to a specific number of traders. Additionally, the timing (by July 15) adds another layer of uncertainty, as market dynamics can change rapidly. Probability: Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of the linked market reaching 377 traders by July 15, given that 'House of the Dragon' S2E7 is rated >8.5 on IMDB two days after release, as 0.55. This estimate reflects a slightly positive inclination due to the potential increased interest in the show following a high IMDB rating but also acknowledges the significant uncertainty and indirectness of the relationship between the rating and market participation."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "a8a552fd-bca9-4e5b-8a7e-7df85f87df15", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) \"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 be rated >8.5 on IMDB 2 days after release, and (b) the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15?", "body": "(a) \"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 (title TBA) will be rated >8.5 on IMDB, based on the score displayed two days after release (July 30th), at noon PT.

First, let's consider the probability that \"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 will be rated >8.5 on IMDB two days after release. The IMDB ratings for popular shows like \"House of the Dragon\" can be quite high, especially immediately after release when the most enthusiastic fans are more likely to rate the episode. However, ratings above 8.5 are still relatively rare, especially considering that this is a strict inequality. Given the popularity of the show and assuming the episode is well-received, I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as moderately high, around 0.6. Next, let's consider the probability that the linked market will have at least 377 traders before market close on July 15. The number of traders in a market can be influenced by many factors, including the popularity of the market, the liquidity of the market, and external advertising or promotion. Without specific data on the current number of traders and the growth rate of the market, it's difficult to make an accurate estimate. However, assuming the market is moderately popular and has been growing steadily, I would estimate the probability of reaching at least 377 traders as moderately low, around 0.4. To find the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event: 0.6 (House of the Dragon S2E7 rated >8.5) * 0.4 (at least 377 traders) = 0.24.

Firstly, the condition of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points suggests a relatively close race at that point in time. In such a scenario, both campaigns might be strategically selective about media appearances to maximize positive exposure and minimize risks. This could potentially reduce the likelihood of Biden engaging in a long, in-person interview where he might be pressed on difficult issues or make gaffes that could be exploited by the opposition. Secondly, the specificity of the criteria for the interview (in-person, at least 45 minutes of new footage, not including press conferences, speeches, rallies, etc.) narrows down the opportunities that would qualify under this question. Given the demands of a presidential campaign, especially in the midst of a heated general election season, candidates' time is extremely valuable and closely guarded. Long, in-person interviews might be seen as too time-consuming or risky, especially if the campaign believes it is not in their best interest strategically. However, it is also plausible that the Biden campaign might see value in a lengthy, in-person interview as an opportunity to showcase Biden's policy depth, personality, and contrast with Trump in a more relaxed setting. Such an interview could provide a platform for Biden to address criticisms, outline his vision, and connect with voters in a more personal way, potentially swaying undecided voters or bolstering his base.

Success in early states can create momentum, but the path to the nomination is long and can be unpredictable. 5.

The structure allows for athletes to compete in more than one category, increasing the potential for winning multiple medals. 3. Player Participation: The decision of top-ranked players to participate in the Olympics can significantly impact the competition. High-profile athletes like Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and Coco Gauff, if participating, could dominate in their respective events. 4. Injury and Fatigue: The tennis calendar is packed, and the Olympics come amidst a busy season, including Grand Slam tournaments. Athletes' conditions and strategies for managing fatigue and potential injuries will play a crucial role in their ability to perform in multiple events. 5.

However, being a media personality and a political candidate are vastly different roles. While his media presence could be an advantage in terms of name recognition, it doesn't directly translate to political viability or the ability to win a nomination. 2. Political Experience: Carlson has no direct experience in elected office, which is often (though not always) a significant factor in securing a presidential nomination. Most nominees have a background in politics, either through holding office or playing a significant role in their party's infrastructure. 3. Competition: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could include seasoned politicians and possibly former President Donald Trump, who has hinted at running again. Such competition would make it challenging for Carlson, lacking in traditional political experience, to secure the nomination. 4. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party's internal dynamics, including the influence of various factions and the preferences of party leaders, play a significant role in the nomination process. Carlson's appeal to certain segments of the party base might not translate to broader support among delegates or in the party establishment. 5. Historical Precedents: While not unheard of, it's relatively rare for individuals without prior political office to secure a major party's presidential nomination.

Therefore, the condition of the Democratic nominee being a woman does not directly affect the probability of any nation winning more than one women's team sport at the Olympics. However, to approach this question, let's consider the general trends and competitiveness in women's team sports at the Olympics. Historically, a few nations have demonstrated dominance across multiple team sports, such as the United States, China, and sometimes European countries like Great Britain, Germany, or the Netherlands. These countries often have strong infrastructures for sports development, significant investment in women's sports, and large talent pools. Given the variety of sports mentioned (association football, 3\u00d73 basketball, 5\u00d75 basketball, field hockey, handball, rugby sevens, volleyball, and water polo), it's reasonable to expect that at least one of these dominant nations will excel in more than one sport. For instance, the United States has traditionally been strong in basketball (both 3\u00d73 and 5\u00d75), volleyball, and water polo. Other nations like Great Britain might excel in sports like field hockey and rugby sevens. The condition for the question resolving as 'No' requires a highly distributed outcome where eight different NOCs win the gold medals in the eight team sports, which seems unlikely given historical patterns of Olympic performance.

Past Performance and Current Standing: Donald Trump has been a dominant figure in the Republican Party since his 2016 presidential campaign. He has a strong base of supporters within the party and has demonstrated an ability to win the Republican nomination in the past. His 2020 re-election campaign, although ultimately unsuccessful, showed that he retains significant support. 2. Current Political Climate: The political landscape in the United States is highly polarized, with Trump remaining a central figure. His influence over the Republican Party and its voters is considerable, and his endorsement is sought after by many Republican candidates in various elections. 3. Potential Opponents: As of my last update, several other Republicans have expressed interest in running for the 2024 nomination, including Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley, among others. While these candidates have their own strengths and bases of support, none have yet shown the same level of broad appeal within the party as Trump. 4. Legal and Health Factors: Trump's legal issues and health could potentially impact his ability to run or be nominated. However, as of my last update, it's unclear how significant these factors will be in determining his eligibility or viability as a candidate. 5. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party's dynamics, including the role of the Republican National Convention, are crucial. Trump has maintained a strong grip on the party's apparatus and enjoys the support of many delegates, which is critical for securing the nomination.

Several factors are at play here: 1. Historical Precedent: The 25th Amendment has been invoked a few times in U.S. history, but its Section 4, which allows the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the President unable to discharge his duties, has never been used. This suggests a high threshold for such action. 2. Political Climate: The current political climate in the United States is highly polarized. While there have been calls from some GOP lawmakers to invoke the 25th Amendment against President Biden, such a move would be extremely contentious and likely met with significant resistance from Democrats and potentially some Republicans. 3. Mechanisms and Thresholds: The process requires the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or another body, such as Congress, through a more complex process) to agree on the President's incapacitation. Given the political makeup of these bodies and the loyalty typically shown to a sitting President by members of their own party, achieving such a majority would be challenging. 4. President's Health and Behavior: There has been no widely acknowledged evidence that President Biden is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, which is the criteria for invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. Speculation and partisan claims do not constitute the kind of evidence required for such a significant step. 5. Time Frame: The question specifies a declaration before August 2024. Given the slow pace at which such high-level political processes move, especially considering the gravity of invoking the 25th Amendment, the timeframe is relatively short for such a dramatic turn of events.

Current Term and Elections: As of my last update, Joe Biden is in the midst of his first term as President of the United States, having taken office in January 2021. Presidential terms are four years long, meaning his term would naturally end in January 2025 unless he were to resign, be impeached and removed, or pass away. 2. Impeachment and Removal: The process of impeaching and removing a president involves both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Given the current political landscape and the fact that impeachment and removal require a supermajority in the Senate (which is rarely achievable, especially considering the current and near-future political compositions), this seems highly unlikely. 3. Resignation or Incapacity: While unexpected events can occur, there's no current indication or precedent to suggest that President Biden would resign. Similarly, serious health issues could lead to the invocation of the 25th Amendment, transferring power to the Vice President, but as of my last update, there's no public information suggesting such a scenario is likely. 4.

This condition suggests a scenario where Trump has a noticeable but not overwhelming lead over Biden. A lead of this margin in July does not necessarily predict the outcome of the election but suggests a competitive race. However, the condition itself does not directly impact the Democratic Party's nomination process. A brokered convention occurs when no candidate wins the majority of the delegates in the first round of voting at the party's convention, necessitating further rounds of voting to select a nominee. This usually happens when there is a highly contested primary with multiple strong candidates. As of the last update in July 2024, without specific information on the current state of the Democratic primary, it's challenging to assess the likelihood of a brokered convention directly. However, the condition given (Trump's lead over Biden) indirectly suggests that if Biden is not performing strongly against Trump, there might be more pressure within the Democratic Party to consider alternative candidates, potentially leading to a more contested primary. Brokered conventions have been rare in recent decades due to changes in the nomination process that favor front-runners and make it easier for them to accumulate a majority of delegates before the convention. Given these considerations, the likelihood of a brokered convention depends more on the dynamics within the Democratic Party and the performance of its candidates in the primaries rather than Trump's lead over Biden in July. However, the condition might indirectly contribute to a more competitive primary if it leads to increased scrutiny of Biden's viability.

Legal Context and Requirements: The trial concerns payments made to Stormy Daniels, which Donald Trump has been accused of orchestrating. Given his direct involvement in the case, there's a possibility he might be called to testify, either by the prosecution or the defense, depending on their strategies. 2. Precedent and Trump's History: Donald Trump has a history of avoiding direct testimony in legal matters, often preferring to settle cases out of court or use executive privilege to avoid testifying. However, in a criminal trial, especially one where he is directly implicated, the stakes are higher, and the legal system's ability to compel testimony is stronger. 3. Public Statements and Intentions: Trump's public statements have often indicated a willingness to confront his accusers and participate in the legal process, at least rhetorically. However, these statements are not always indicative of his final actions. 4. Legal Strategy: The decision to testify would ultimately depend on the defense strategy. If Trump's legal team believes his testimony could help exonerate him or significantly improve his case, they might encourage him to testify. Conversely, if they believe his testimony could harm his case, they would likely advise against it. 5. Compulsion to Testify: In a criminal trial, the prosecution can subpoena witnesses, including the defendant. If Trump is subpoenaed, he would be legally compelled to testify unless he invokes the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Given these considerations, the probability that Donald Trump will testify at the hush money trial depends on a complex interplay of legal strategy, personal inclination, and legal compulsion.

Francis Suarez's Impact: Understanding the impact of Francis Suarez as the Republican nominee on the Democratic Party's strategy and confidence in Biden's candidacy is crucial. Suarez, being a relatively less known figure compared to other potential Republican nominees, might not initially be seen as a significant threat by the Democratic Party. However, his nomination could also be perceived as an opportunity for the Democrats to rally behind Biden, especially if Suarez is seen as a weaker opponent compared to other potential Republican candidates. 2. Democratic Party Unity and Strategy: The Democratic Party's unity and strategy going into the 2024 election will play a significant role. If the party is seen as united behind Biden, it's less likely that Senators would call for him to drop out. However, if there are existing rifts or concerns about Biden's electability or performance, Suarez's nomination might exacerbate these issues, potentially leading to calls for Biden to step aside. 3. Biden's Performance and Health: President Biden's performance, health, and public perception could also influence the decision of Democratic Senators. If Biden is seen as struggling or if health concerns become more pronounced, it could lead to increased calls for him to drop out, regardless of the Republican nominee. 4. Historical Precedents: Historically, it's rare for a significant number of Senators from a President's own party to call for the President to drop out of an election, especially when that President is the incumbent. This suggests a natural reluctance within parties to undermine their own candidate, especially in the face of an upcoming election against an opposing party's nominee. 5. Public Opinion and Polling: The state of public opinion and polling on Biden vs. Suarez would also be a critical factor. If polls indicate a close race or if Suarez is seen as a surprisingly strong candidate, it could lead to increased pressure on Biden to step aside in favor of a potentially stronger candidate. Considering these factors, the likelihood of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20, given Francis Suarez as the Republican nominee, seems low. The Democratic Party's tendency to rally behind their candidate, the rarity of Senators calling for their party's President to drop out, and the strategic implications of such a move all suggest that this scenario is unlikely."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "d7567090-d099-4712-885d-059f4460fdb0", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Francis Suarez be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election and (b) 10 or more Democratic Senators call for Biden to drop out before July 20?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as **Yes** if Francis Suarez is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Meta's Past Practices: Meta has shown a commitment to researching and publishing on various aspects of AI, including safety. However, the specific practice of publishing external red-teaming results for their models is less common. The company has been involved in various initiatives aimed at improving AI safety, but the extent to which these efforts include external red-teaming and public reporting is variable. 2. Increasing Emphasis on AI Safety: There's a growing awareness and concern about the safety of AI systems, especially as they become more integrated into critical aspects of society. This has led to increased calls for transparency and rigorous testing, including through external red-teaming. Given this trend, it's plausible that major AI developers like Meta would move towards more transparent safety assessments, including external evaluations. 3. Role of External Red-Teaming: External red-teaming is a practice where independent parties attempt to find vulnerabilities or flaws in a system. In the context of AI models, this can be particularly valuable for identifying safety risks that the developers themselves might overlook. The publication of such results can help build trust in the safety of AI systems and demonstrate a company's commitment to safety. Considering these points, the likelihood of Meta publishing a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, hinges on the company's willingness to prioritize transparency and safety in the face of growing public and regulatory scrutiny. Given the trend towards increased transparency and the importance of external validation for AI safety, it seems reasonable to expect that Meta would engage in such practices.

Interest in AI Safety: The topic of AI safety and the transparency of major AI developers like Meta in their safety protocols have been gaining significant attention. This interest could attract traders who are keen on the implications of such reports on the future of AI development and its safety. 2. Market Awareness and Accessibility: The visibility of the linked market and how easily potential traders can access and participate in it will significantly affect the number of traders it attracts. If the market is well-promoted and easily accessible, it's more likely to reach the threshold of 377 traders. 3. Relevance of the Report: The content and implications of the report published by Meta could influence the perceived importance and potential impact on the market, thereby affecting trader interest. A report with significant or controversial findings could increase interest and participation in the market. 4. Time Frame: The time frame between the publication of the report (by June 30, 2024) and the end of July 15, 2024, provides about two weeks for traders to react and participate in the market. This is a relatively short window, which might limit the number of participants but could also concentrate interest and participation due to the urgency and novelty of the report. 5. Historical Precedents: If there have been similar markets or events in the past related to AI safety reports, the participation levels in those could provide some insight into potential interest. However, without specific data, this remains speculative. Given these considerations, the question revolves around the appeal of a very specific event (the publication of a safety report by Meta) to a specialized audience (those interested in AI safety and its market implications). While it's challenging to estimate without knowing the specifics of the report or the historical engagement levels with similar markets, there's a reasonable expectation that the combination of a timely, potentially impactful report and a well-accessible market could attract a considerable number of traders. However, predicting that it will reach exactly 377 traders involves a high degree of uncertainty.

For instance, in 2022, they qualified and finished 7th in the Grand Final, and in 2023, they also qualified, showing a current upward trend in their performance. Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the artist's performance play a significant role in qualification.

Competition: The level of competition in the semi-finals can greatly affect a country's chances of qualifying. Some years see a higher concentration of traditionally strong performers in one semi-final over the other. Without knowing the specific lineup for Moldova's semi-final, it's challenging to assess the competition level accurately. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can sometimes follow predictable patterns, with certain countries favoring others due to cultural, geographical, or political reasons. Moldova might benefit from votes from neighboring or culturally aligned countries, but this factor can be unpredictable and subject to change from year to year. Recent Trends: Recent years have shown a slight shift in voting patterns, with juries and public votes sometimes diverging significantly. A memorable and catchy performance can do well with the public, while the juries might prioritize different aspects such as vocal technique or originality.

Understanding the Question: The question asks whether Donald Trump will gain at least 3% more votes among Manifold respondents when facing Joe Biden directly compared to facing a generic Democrat. 2. Analyzing the Polls: There are two polls in question. One pits Trump against Joe Biden, and the other pits Trump against a generic Democrat. The outcome we're interested in is whether Trump's percentage of votes significantly increases (by 3% or more) when the opponent is specified as Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat. 3. Public Opinion Context: It's given that public opinion polls show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, but other Democrats either lead Trump or are within the margin of error in hypothetical matchups. This suggests a specific disadvantage for Biden in the broader public opinion context. 4. Manifold Respondents Representativeness: The question hints at whether Manifold respondents reflect the broader public opinion trends. If they do, one might expect Trump to perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat among these respondents as well. 5. Calculation Method: The formula to determine Trump's percentage of votes in each poll is (Trump votes / (Trump votes + Democrat votes + Someone else votes)). The question resolves to YES if Trump's percentage in the poll against Biden is 3% or more higher than in the poll against a generic Democrat. Given these considerations, let's reason through the likely outcome: - If Manifold respondents mirror the broader public opinion trends, and given that Biden tends to perform worse than a generic Democrat against Trump in those polls, it's plausible that Trump could gain more votes when facing Biden directly. - The specific 3% threshold is a critical factor. It requires not just a marginal improvement but a noticeable difference in Trump's performance against Biden compared to a generic Democrat. Considering these points, the probability that Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat seems somewhat likely, given the general trend of Biden underperforming in direct matchups against Trump in public opinion polls."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "f7d46335-eab4-4f53-886b-29bdab36fed0", "title": "Conditional on Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat, will a group of at least 5 named Dem House Members or US Senators pressure Biden to drop out before July 20th?", "body": "There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6.

His health and political stance might be subjects of speculation, but without concrete evidence suggesting he would drop out, we must consider this event as having a low probability.

Mike Pence, as a former Vice President, has a certain level of recognition and support within the party, but the competition is likely to be fierce. Without knowing the exact lineup of candidates and how the primaries will unfold, it's difficult to assign a high probability to any single candidate at this early stage. Given these considerations, let's assign rough probabilities: Event (a), Biden dropping out before July 20, seems unlikely without current evidence, so a probability of around 0.05 might be reasonable. Event (b), Mike Pence becoming the Republican nominee, is uncertain due to the potential crowded field and the unpredictability of primary elections.

Current Political Landscape and Popularity of Fidesz-KDNP: As of my last update, Fidesz-KDNP, led by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has been the dominant political force in Hungary for over a decade. The alliance has maintained a strong grip on power, both in the national parliament and in the European Parliament elections. Orb\u00e1n's government has been known for its nationalist policies, which have a significant appeal to a large segment of the Hungarian electorate. 2. Strength of Opposition Parties: The opposition in Hungary has faced significant challenges in uniting against Fidesz-KDNP. Despite efforts to form coalitions, opposition parties have struggled to present a united front that could effectively challenge the ruling party's dominance. The fragmentation of the opposition has historically played to Fidesz-KDNP's advantage. 3. Voter Sentiment and Potential Changes: Public opinion can shift due to various factors, including economic conditions, corruption scandals, and EU policies. However, Fidesz-KDNP has shown resilience in maintaining its voter base. The party's strong control over media outlets in Hungary also gives it a significant advantage in shaping public opinion. 4. European Parliament Elections Dynamics: European Parliament elections often have lower turnout compared to national elections, which can affect the outcome. Parties with a strong, mobilized base tend to perform better. Fidesz-KDNP has historically been effective in mobilizing its supporters. Considering these factors, while there is always a possibility of shifts in public opinion and political landscapes, the likelihood of Fidesz-KDNP maintaining its plurality in the 2024 European Parliament elections appears high, given its entrenched position, the fragmented state of the opposition, and its ability to mobilize its base."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "ccd7ddf3-c6f7-44ae-a385-dbd0477cedde", "title": "Conditional on Fidesz-KDNP maintaining its EU plurality from Hungary in 2024, will the EU announce new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Fidesz-KDNP maintains its plurality of Hungarian seats in the European Parliament following the 2024 elections, meaning they secure more seats than any other single party or coalition according to credible sources.

This information is related to the political landscape and does not directly impact the market capitalization of either Nvidia or Apple. However, it could potentially influence the overall stock market or investor sentiment based on expectations of future economic policies or regulatory changes. Yet, the direct link between a specific political poll result and the relative market capitalizations of two technology companies is tenuous at best. Second, we need to consider what factors would lead to Nvidia's market capitalization being larger than Apple's. Nvidia's market capitalization could surpass Apple's due to various factors such as significant advancements in Nvidia's technology, major business partnerships, or financial reports showing substantial growth. Conversely, Apple's market capitalization could decline due to negative financial reports, product failures, or legal issues. Given the information provided, there is no direct causal link between Trump's lead in the polls and the relative market capitalizations of Nvidia and Apple.

For event (a), predicting Trump's lead over Biden within a specific range (>2 and \u22643 points) involves significant uncertainty. Polling averages can fluctuate based on numerous factors, including new polls being added, changes in public opinion, and methodological adjustments by the pollsters. Given the narrow range specified, this condition is quite specific and inherently difficult to predict with high confidence. For event (b), comparing Nvidia's market capitalization to Apple's on a specific date also involves uncertainty. Market capitalization can fluctuate rapidly due to stock price movements, which are influenced by a wide array of factors including earnings reports, industry trends, macroeconomic conditions, and investor sentiment. While Nvidia has been a strong performer in the technology sector, especially with the growth of AI and related technologies, predicting its market capitalization to surpass Apple's (one of the largest companies in the world by market cap) on a specific date is challenging. Given these considerations, both conditions (a) and (b) are individually difficult to predict with high confidence.

The Greens\u2013EFA (European Free Alliance) is a political group in the European Parliament that combines the European Green Party and the European Free Alliance. This group has seen a significant increase in popularity over the past few years, largely due to growing public concern about climate change, environmental issues, and the desire for more progressive policies within the EU. In the 2019 European Parliament elections, the Greens\u2013EFA group secured 74 seats, which was a substantial increase from the 52 seats they held after the 2014 elections. This growth reflected a broader trend of increased support for Green parties across Europe, with notable surges in countries like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. However, it's essential to consider the overall composition of the European Parliament and the relative strength of other political groups. The European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) traditionally have been the two largest groups in the Parliament. While the Greens\u2013EFA has been growing, it still trails behind these two groups in terms of the total number of seats. Looking ahead to the 2024 European Parliament elections, several factors could influence the outcome: 1. Continued Public Focus on Environmental Issues: If environmental concerns and climate change remain high on the public agenda, this could bolster support for the Greens\u2013EFA. 2. Political Shifts in Key Member States: Changes in the political landscape of major EU countries, such as Germany and France, can significantly impact the distribution of seats in the European Parliament. 3. Economic and Social Factors: The economic situation, migration policies, and social issues can also sway voters' preferences, potentially affecting the relative performance of different political groups. Given these considerations, while the Greens\u2013EFA group is likely to maintain or even increase its representation in the European Parliament, surpassing both the EPP and S&D to hold the most seats seems challenging based on current trends and the historical dominance of these two groups. Therefore, the probability that the Greens\u2013EFA will hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections is difficult to estimate with high precision but is likely on the lower end of the spectrum due to the reasons mentioned above."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "5da34484-84b0-4f71-995f-4f8f7d81533d", "title": "If Greens\u2013EFA holds the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections, will OpenAI's ChatGPT be generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The Greens\u2013EFA political group holds the most seats after the 2024 European Parliament elections.

First, we consider the likelihood of Tucker Carlson being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Tucker Carlson is a well-known media personality, hosting a popular show on Fox News. However, the step from media personality to presidential nominee is significant and involves a complex process of political maneuvering, public support, and ultimately, the decision of the Republican National Convention delegates. While Carlson has influence within conservative circles, the Republican Party's nomination process is highly competitive and involves numerous stakeholders and potential candidates, many of whom have more traditional political backgrounds and experience. The likelihood of Carlson being selected, while not impossible, is relatively low given the field of potential candidates and the factors that typically influence party nominations. Second, we examine the likelihood of the Republican Party retaining Ohio's 6th congressional district in the 2024 special election. Ohio's 6th congressional district has historically been a Republican stronghold, with Bill Johnson holding the seat since 2011. The district's political leanings suggest that the Republican Party has a strong chance of retaining the seat in a special election, especially considering the general trend of lower voter turnout in special elections, which can favor the party with a historical advantage in the district. Considering these factors, the probability of both conditions being met\u2014Tucker Carlson being selected as the Republican nominee and the Republican Party retaining Ohio's 6th congressional district\u2014is influenced by the lower likelihood of the first condition (Carlson's nomination) and the higher likelihood of the second condition (retaining the congressional seat).

The first part of the question involves a scenario where at least 20 House Members or Senators who caucus with the Democratic Party sign a public letter opposing the early nomination plan before market close at the end of Sunday, July 21st. This action is a response to the DNC's move to potentially seal President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination sooner than originally planned, which some Democrats argue stifles debate about his candidacy. The existence of such opposition indicates internal party dynamics and concerns regarding President Biden's candidacy, possibly reflecting broader political tensions. The outcome of interest is whether Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Larry Elder's nomination would depend on various factors, including his performance in primaries, his appeal to Republican voters and delegates, and the overall political climate leading up to the convention. Given the lack of a direct causal link between Democratic opposition to an early nomination plan and the selection process of the Republican nominee, the probability of Larry Elder becoming the Republican nominee should be assessed based on his standing within the Republican Party, his appeal to Republican voters, and other factors specific to the Republican nomination process. Without specific data on Larry Elder's current standing in polls, his fundraising capabilities, or his support among key Republican stakeholders, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. However, considering the independence of the events described, the probability should be based on an assessment of Elder's strengths and weaknesses within the context of the Republican Party's nomination process, rather than the actions of Democratic lawmakers regarding their party's nomination process. The probability estimate for Larry Elder becoming the Republican nominee should be derived from his relative position within the Republican field, which is not directly influenced by Democratic lawmakers' actions regarding their party's nomination process. Given the lack of specific information on Larry Elder's current prospects within the Republican Party and considering the nature of the question, a neutral stance might suggest a probability around 0.05 (5%), acknowledging that there are typically multiple contenders for a party's nomination and without further information, assigning a low but not negligible chance to any one candidate.

Condition (a) requires at least one athlete to win at least two medals for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Tennis at the Olympics typically includes five events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Given the nature of tennis competitions, where top players often participate in multiple events, it's not uncommon for top athletes to win more than one medal. The likelihood of this happening is relatively high, especially considering the dominance of certain players in the sport. However, upsets can occur, and the distribution of talent in tennis can lead to different winners across events. A reasonable estimate for condition (a) occurring might be around 70-80%, considering historical trends and the competitive landscape of tennis. Condition (b) requires Individual Neutral Athletes to collectively win 21 or more gold medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The term 'Individual Neutral Athletes' likely refers to athletes competing under the Olympic flag or a neutral designation due to various reasons such as sanctions against their home countries. The number of athletes competing under this designation and their distribution across sports can significantly vary from one Olympics to another. The requirement for them to win 21 or more gold medals is quite high, considering the total number of gold medals available across all sports and the global distribution of athletic talent. Without specific information on the number of Individual Neutral Athletes, the sports they are competing in, and their competitive level, this condition seems challenging to meet. A conservative estimate might place the probability of this condition being met at around 10-20%. Given these estimates, the probability of both conditions being met (the intersection of the two independent events) would be the product of their individual probabilities.

(a) At least 5 countries win their debut gold medal: It's not uncommon for several countries to win their first Olympic gold medals at each edition of the Games. The Olympics feature a vast array of sports and events, and the global distribution of talent across these sports means that many countries have the potential to achieve their first gold in any given Olympic cycle. The inclusion of new sports and events at the Olympics often provides fresh opportunities for countries to win their first gold medals. For the Paris 2024 Olympics, the introduction of breakdancing could open up new avenues for countries that have not traditionally been strong in Olympic sports. The increasing globalization of sports and investment in sports infrastructure and training programs around the world means that more countries are capable of producing athletes who can compete at the highest level. Given these factors, it seems reasonable to expect that at least 5 countries could win their first-ever Olympic gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics. (b) Individual Neutral Athletes win at least 15 gold medals: Individual Neutral Athletes typically refer to athletes who compete under the Olympic flag rather than for a specific country. Historically, athletes competing under neutral flags have shown the capability to win a significant number of medals. However, the number of gold medals required (15) is quite high and would likely necessitate a large contingent of highly competitive athletes. Without knowing the exact number of athletes who will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes or their distribution across sports, it's challenging to predict their medal haul accurately. While it's plausible that Individual Neutral Athletes could win a substantial number of gold medals, achieving 15 or more gold medals might be a stretch unless there is a large and highly competitive contingent. Given the analysis above, condition (a) seems relatively plausible based on historical trends and the increasing global spread of sporting talent. Condition (b), however, appears less likely due to the high threshold of 15 gold medals required for Individual Neutral Athletes. To combine these assessments into a probability estimate for both conditions being met: Condition (a) seems more likely than not, so let's tentatively assign a probability of around 0.6 to 0.7. Condition (b) seems less likely, so let's assign a probability of around 0.2 to 0.3. Assuming independence between these two conditions, the combined probability of both occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities. Taking the lower end of the estimate for condition (a) (0.6) and the higher end for condition (b) (0.3) to provide a somewhat optimistic yet cautious estimate, the combined probability would be 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18. Therefore, the probability that both conditions will be met at the Paris 2024 Olympics is estimated to be around 0.18."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.02158054049691649, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.007193513498972163, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.22208616512135523, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Ted Cruz as the Republican Nominee: The first condition assumes Ted Cruz becomes the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This is a hypothetical scenario, and we need to consider how this would impact the overall election dynamics, particularly focusing on how it influences the Democratic nominee's chances, in this case, assumed to be Kamala Harris. 2. Impact on Kamala Harris's Odds: With Ted Cruz as the nominee, several factors could influence Kamala Harris's odds of winning. These include Cruz's political stance, his appeal to moderate voters, his ability to galvanize the Republican base, and how he matches up against Harris in terms of policy debates and personal likability. 3. Nate Silver's Model: Nate Silver's election model is highly regarded for its comprehensive approach, incorporating polling data, economic indicators, and historical trends. The model's output, in terms of Electoral College probabilities, reflects a nuanced analysis of the election landscape. Given these considerations, let's reason through the potential outcome: - Ted Cruz's Nomination Impact: Cruz is known for his conservative stance, which can both energize the Republican base and potentially alienate moderate voters. His nomination could lead to a polarized election environment, where both candidates might see their base support solidify. - Kamala Harris's Response and Public Perception: Harris's odds of winning would likely be influenced by how effectively she can capitalize on Cruz's nomination. If she can successfully appeal to moderate voters and independents who might be turned off by Cruz's conservative positions, her odds could improve. - Nate Silver's Model Reaction: The model would likely adjust Harris's Electoral College probabilities based on polling data post-Cruz's nomination. If polls indicate that Cruz's nomination has led to increased support for Harris among key demographics or in swing states, her Electoral College probabilities would likely increase. Considering these factors, the assumption that Kamala Harris's odds of winning would increase according to Nate Silver's model, given Ted Cruz as the Republican nominee, seems plausible. This is because Cruz's conservative stance might push some moderates towards Harris, and if she effectively campaigns on this dynamic, her support could broaden. However, predicting election outcomes is inherently uncertain, and many variables can influence the final result. Given the complexity and the time frame specified (the odds on a specific Friday evening), the outcome could be influenced by immediate reactions and short-term polling fluctuations."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "3bae53e1-bfa2-4bc2-81b0-7780d553d79d", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (b) Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: \n\n1.

Firstly, it's essential to understand the qualification process for the Eurovision Grand Final. Participating countries are divided into two semi-finals, and the top 10 countries from each semi-final, as determined by a combination of jury and public voting, qualify for the Grand Final. Historically, both Switzerland and Portugal have had varying degrees of success in Eurovision. Switzerland has been a consistent participant but has had mixed results, often failing to qualify for the Grand Final. However, in recent years, Switzerland has seen a resurgence in success, qualifying for the Grand Final in 2019 and achieving a top 5 finish in 2021. Portugal, on the other hand, has also had its share of ups and downs but notably won the contest in 2017 and has qualified for the Grand Final several times in the past decade. Given the unpredictable nature of Eurovision voting, which can be influenced by a wide range of factors including song quality, performance, and geopolitical considerations, predicting qualification is inherently uncertain. However, considering the recent performance improvements of both Switzerland and Portugal, along with the assumption that they will both participate in their respective semi-finals, we can cautiously estimate their chances. Since both countries have shown the capability to produce high-quality entries and have a supportive fan base, it's reasonable to assume they both have a decent chance of qualifying. However, the competition is fierce, with many other countries also vying for the top spots.

'House of the Dragon' is a popular TV series, and its ratings on IMDB are determined by the audience's response to the show. On the other hand, 'Trap' is a film directed by M.

This suggests that his films can have different audience reactions, and it's difficult to predict the CinemaScore of 'Trap' based solely on his previous work. The condition of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 being rated >8.5 on IMDB does not provide any direct insight into how 'Trap' will be received by audiences. The two are unrelated, and the success or high rating of one does not influence the other. Therefore, without any direct connection or predictive pattern, we must rely on the general probability of a film receiving a certain CinemaScore. Given the range of CinemaScores for M.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) will receive a CinemaScore of B or above, we must analyze each component separately and then consider the combined probability. The IMDB ratings for 'House of the Dragon' have generally been high, with most episodes in both seasons receiving ratings above 8.0. The ratings have fluctuated, with some episodes dipping as low as 6.1 in Season 2, but the overall trend suggests that the series is well-regarded by viewers. Season finales often receive higher ratings due to their conclusive nature and the resolution of plotlines, which can lead to increased viewer satisfaction. Given this, it's plausible that the season finale, S2E8, could receive a rating >8.5, considering the pattern of high ratings for season finales (E7 and E10 in Season 1 received 9.1 and 9.2, respectively). However, the variability in ratings, especially the lower ratings in some episodes of Season 2, introduces some uncertainty. M. Night Shyamalan's films have had mixed receptions, but he has a history of achieving respectable CinemaScores, with 'Split' and 'Glass' receiving B+ and B, respectively. However, his more recent films, 'Old' and 'Knock at the Cabin,' received lower scores (C+ and C, respectively), indicating a decline in audience approval. Given this mixed record, predicting a CinemaScore of B or above for 'Trap' is challenging. The trailer may have been well-received, but audience reactions to the full film can differ significantly from their initial impressions based on promotional materials. Considering both components, the probability that both conditions will be met (the IMDB rating for 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 being >8.5 and 'Trap' receiving a CinemaScore of B or above) involves multiplying the probabilities of each event occurring. While we can be somewhat optimistic about the IMDB rating for 'House of the Dragon' S2E8, the uncertainty surrounding the reception of 'Trap' makes the overall probability more challenging to assess. If we were to assign a rough estimate of 60% for 'House of the Dragon' achieving an IMDB rating >8.5 and a more cautious estimate of 40% for 'Trap' achieving a CinemaScore of B or above, the combined probability would be approximately 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0003226660173255014, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00010755533910850046, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.16282240225645908, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The first condition for the question to resolve as 'Yes' involves Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) advising against either Elon Musk's pay package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk to the Tesla board of directors. ISS is a significant advisory firm that provides recommendations to shareholders on how to vote on corporate governance issues, including executive compensation and board elections. Their recommendations can influence the outcome of shareholder votes, although they are not determinative. The second part of the question concerns whether Donald Trump Jr. will be selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This outcome is contingent on a variety of factors, including the results of primary elections, the dynamics within the Republican Party, and the preferences of delegates at the Republican National Convention. The advice of ISS against Musk's package or Kimbal Musk's re-election is a specific event that could happen but is not directly related to the broader political landscape or the internal dynamics of the Republican Party. The selection of Donald Trump Jr. as the Republican nominee for 2024 is a political event influenced by numerous factors, including party politics, primary election outcomes, and delegate preferences at the convention. There is no direct causal link between ISS's advice on Tesla's corporate governance issues and the selection process for the Republican presidential nominee. Predicting political outcomes, especially those as specific as a party's nominee for president, involves a high degree of uncertainty and is influenced by a wide array of factors, including public opinion, political strategy, and unforeseen events. Given the lack of a direct connection between ISS's advice on Tesla matters and the Republican nomination process, and considering the inherent unpredictability of political outcomes, the probability of Donald Trump Jr. being the Republican nominee for 2024 contingent on ISS advising against Musk's package or re-election does not significantly differ from the unconditional probability of him being selected as the nominee. However, since the question requires a numerical estimate and considering the information provided does not offer a clear path to quantifying the probability accurately, we must rely on general knowledge and the understanding that predicting specific political outcomes is inherently uncertain. This probability estimate reflects the understanding that predicting specific political outcomes, such as a party's nominee for president, is highly uncertain and influenced by numerous factors not directly related to ISS's advice on corporate governance issues. The estimate is somewhat conservative, reflecting the general uncertainty of political predictions rather than a specific analysis linking ISS's advice to the outcome of the Republican nomination process."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "52226a2b-314d-4658-adeb-30ac3dacb06c", "title": "Will BOTH of the following occur: (1) Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) advises Tesla shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $57 billion package OR the re-election of Kimbal Musk, AND (2) Donald Trump Jr. is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(1) The first condition will resolve as **Yes** if ISS releases a statement explicitly advising Tesla shareholders to vote *against* either Elon Musk's pay package at the 2024 Tesla shareholder meeting OR the re-election of Kimbal Musk to the Tesla board of directors.

However, as of now, there hasn't been any definitive indication that he plans to step down due to these factors. 2. Political Climate: The decision to run for re-election is heavily influenced by the current political climate, including the President's approval ratings, the state of the economy, and the likelihood of winning the election. While these factors can change rapidly, they are crucial in determining a president's decision to seek re-election. 3. Previous Statements and Actions: President Biden has previously indicated his intention to run for re-election, though such statements are always subject to change based on various factors, including political strategy and personal considerations. 4. Historical Context: It's rare for incumbent presidents not to seek re-election unless faced with significant political opposition within their party, severe health issues, or major scandals. As of now, there's no clear indication that any of these factors will definitively prevent President Biden from seeking re-election. 5. Timing and Party Strategy: The timing of such an announcement is strategic. Early announcements can affect the political landscape, impacting potential challengers' decisions and the party's overall strategy for the election cycle. Considering these factors, while there are reasons that might suggest President Biden could decide not to seek re-election, such as his age and the unpredictable nature of politics, there hasn't been any clear indication that he plans to make such an announcement before July 15, 2024.

Franchise Performance: Both 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' are part of the X-Men franchise, which has a strong fan base. The success of these individual films indicates a solid foundation for a combined effort. 2. Character Popularity: Deadpool and Wolverine are among the most popular characters in the X-Men universe. Their combined presence in a single film could potentially double the appeal, attracting fans of both characters. 3. Marketing and Hype: The announcement of a joint film featuring these two characters would likely generate significant buzz and excitement, potentially leading to a higher opening weekend as fans rush to see the film. 4. Cinematic Universe Strategy: The success of Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU) has shown that combining characters in a well-crafted narrative can lead to box office success. Although 'Deadpool & Wolverine' isn't part of the MCU, the strategy of combining popular characters could still apply. 5. Box Office Trends: The box office performance of superhero movies has generally been strong in recent years, with many films breaking records. This trend suggests a favorable environment for a film like 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' However, there are also potential challenges: 1. Competition: The release date of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' and the competitive landscape at the time of its release could impact its box office performance. A crowded market with other highly anticipated films could dilute its opening weekend numbers. 2. Reception and Reviews: The film's quality, as perceived by critics and audiences, will significantly impact its box office performance. A poorly received film might not meet the combined opening numbers of its predecessors. 3. Marketing Execution: While the potential for hype is high, the execution of the marketing campaign will play a crucial role in translating that hype into ticket sales. Given these considerations, the probability of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' having a domestic box office opening higher than the combined openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' seems favorable due to the strong fan base, character popularity, and the potential for significant marketing hype.

However, since both Ireland and Iceland are geographically and culturally somewhat isolated from the rest of Europe, their voting patterns might be less predictable. Given these considerations, the qualification of Iceland does not directly influence Ireland's chances of qualification due to the individual assessment of each performance by the juries and public voting. However, knowing that Iceland has qualified could suggest a favorable voting environment for countries that might not always be at the forefront of the contest, indicating a possible openness to a broader range of musical styles or performances.

First, let's consider the historical performance. Croatia has had a mixed record in Eurovision, with some successful years but also several non-qualifications. Malta, on the other hand, has had a more consistent record of qualifying for the final, but their placings have varied. Voting patterns are also crucial. Eurovision voting often shows patterns of regional and cultural alliances, with countries from the same region or with cultural ties voting for each other more frequently. However, these patterns can be unpredictable and subject to change. Given that Croatia qualifies for the Grand Final, it suggests that their performance was strong enough to appeal to a broad audience or that they benefited from favorable voting patterns. However, this does not directly influence Malta's chances, as each country's qualification is determined independently. The overall competition dynamics, including the quality of the performances, the staging, and the audience's preferences, also play a significant role. A strong performance by Malta could secure their qualification regardless of Croatia's success. Considering these factors, while there is no direct correlation between Croatia's qualification and Malta's, the fact that one country from a similar region or with a similar level of historical success qualifies does not significantly impact the other's chances.

The question centers around the practice of red-teaming, which is an independent evaluation process used to assess the safety and vulnerabilities of AI models. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of AI development and the increasing importance of AI safety, companies like Meta and Anthropic are under scrutiny for their practices in ensuring the safety and reliability of their models. The question asks us to consider the scenario where Meta publishes a public report with results from an external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, and then assess the likelihood that Anthropic will also publish a similar report by the same date. Firstly, it's essential to consider the motivations and pressures that could drive these companies to engage in external red-teaming and publicly disclose the findings. Regulatory pressures, public scrutiny, and the competitive advantage gained by demonstrating a commitment to safety could all play significant roles. Meta, being a large and well-established player in the tech industry, might face significant pressure to demonstrate its commitment to AI safety, not just from regulatory bodies but also from the public and investors. Given this, if Meta were to publish such a report, it would set a precedent and possibly raise the bar for transparency and safety practices in the AI industry. Anthropic, on the other hand, is also a notable player in AI development, with a strong focus on AI safety and ethics. The company's mission and values emphasize the importance of developing AI in a way that is transparent, safe, and beneficial to society. This suggests that Anthropic might be inclined to follow suit, especially if doing so becomes seen as a best practice or an industry standard. However, the likelihood of Anthropic publishing a similar report by the exact same date (June 30, 2024) also depends on the company's current readiness, ongoing efforts in red-teaming, and strategic decisions about when and how to share such information. If Anthropic already has ongoing efforts in this direction, it might be more likely to publish a report in the same timeframe. Considering these factors, the probability of Anthropic publishing a public report with results from an external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, given that Meta does the same, is higher than a neutral 50% because both companies operate in an environment that increasingly values transparency and safety.

Condition Given: The question is predicated on a specific scenario where, as of July 15, 2024, Donald Trump leads Joe Biden by more than 2 but less than or equal to 3 points in 538's national polling average. This condition suggests a relatively tight race but with Trump having a slight edge. 2. Implication of the Condition: The narrow lead by Trump might indicate a few things: - The race is competitive, and both candidates have significant support. - Trump, despite any potential controversies or challenges, remains a strong candidate within the Republican Party. - Biden, or the Democratic Party, might be facing their own set of challenges or voter fatigue, which could be impacting their polling numbers. 3. Asa Hutchinson as the Republican Nominee: Asa Hutchinson, the Governor of Arkansas, has been mentioned in discussions about potential Republican candidates, but he has not been as prominently associated with the 2024 presidential race as Trump. Hutchinson represents a more traditional or establishment wing of the Republican Party, which might not have as strong of a grip on the party's base as Trump does. 4. Analysis: Given Trump's lead in the polls and his strong base within the Republican Party, it's challenging to envision a scenario where he would not be the nominee, especially considering the condition provided. Trump has a significant hold on the party, and his polling numbers, as described, suggest he remains a viable candidate for the presidency. The Republican National Convention's delegates are likely to support the candidate with the strongest chance of winning, which, based on the condition, appears to be Trump. 5. Conclusion: Considering these factors, the likelihood of Asa Hutchinson being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, given the condition that Trump leads Biden by more than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points in the polls, is low."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "2ae8f28d-a1a6-43f6-b4fe-483a90053472", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, and (b) Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's [national polling average for the 2024 presidential election](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/) as reported on the chart for the date of July 15, 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024.
