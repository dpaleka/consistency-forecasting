Current Political Landscape: As of my last update, the Republican Party is still largely influenced by former President Donald Trump. However, the popularity and influence of Donald Trump Jr. within the party, while significant, do not overshadow that of his father or other prominent Republican figures. 2. Potential Candidates: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 election is broad and includes several high-profile individuals, some of whom have already expressed interest or have been rumored to be considering a run. This includes former President Donald Trump himself, former Vice President Mike Pence, and several current and former governors and senators. The competition is fierce, and Donald Trump Jr. would need to navigate this crowded field successfully. 3. Experience and Appeal: Donald Trump Jr. has been involved in politics, particularly in campaigning for his father and supporting various Republican candidates. However, he lacks the executive or legislative experience that many other potential candidates possess. His appeal to the broader Republican base and independents is also a question mark, as his public persona is closely tied to his father's, which could be both a boon and a bane. 4. Primary Process: The Republican nomination process involves a series of primaries and caucuses across the states, culminating in the Republican National Convention. Success in this process requires a combination of grassroots support, strategic campaigning, and the ability to fundraise effectively. While Donald Trump Jr. might have an advantage in name recognition and possibly fundraising due to his family connections, he would still need to demonstrate broad appeal across different states and demographics within the party. 5. Historical Precedents: There's no direct precedent for a son of a president being nominated by a major party immediately following the presidency of their parent, especially in a scenario where the parent is still politically active. This makes it challenging to draw historical parallels. Considering these factors, while Donald Trump Jr. has a level of visibility and support that could make him a contender, the competitive nature of the Republican primary field, combined with the uncertainties of his broad appeal and the complex dynamics of the primary process, suggest that his nomination is not the most likely outcome."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "965f7c90-fecb-4bf7-bc99-a4608d641958", "title": "Will Nikki Haley be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election and not Donald Trump Jr.?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Nikki Haley is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (2) Donald Trump Jr. is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Firstly, as of my last update in 2023, Nikki Haley has announced her candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, while Donald Trump Jr. has not officially announced a candidacy but remains a popular figure within the party, partly due to his father's influence. However, without an official candidacy, his path to nomination is less clear. Secondly, Nikki Haley, a former Governor of South Carolina and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under President Donald Trump, has a strong political background that could appeal to a broad spectrum of Republican voters. Her official entry into the race gives her a clear advantage over potential candidates who have not yet declared. Thirdly, the dynamics within the Republican Party are complex, with various factions vying for influence. The party's choice of nominee will depend on who they believe can best represent their interests and win the general election. Nikki Haley's more traditional Republican credentials, combined with her experience in international affairs, could position her well. Lastly, the influence of former President Donald Trump cannot be underestimated. His endorsement or lack thereof can significantly impact a candidate's chances. If he chooses not to run himself and does not endorse his son, his endorsement could potentially go to another candidate, including Nikki Haley, significantly boosting her chances.

Firstly, Mike Pence has a strong background in Republican politics, having served as Vice President under Donald Trump from 2017 to 2021. He has maintained a high profile within the party and has been a vocal advocate for conservative values. This experience and reputation could work in his favor among Republican voters and delegates. However, it's also important to consider the competition Pence might face. The Republican field for the 2024 nomination is likely to be crowded, with several other high-profile candidates potentially vying for the top spot. Donald Trump himself has hinted at running again, and other notable figures like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Ted Cruz might also throw their hats into the ring. This competition could make it challenging for Pence to stand out and secure the nomination. Additionally, Pence's relationship with Trump could be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, his association with the former President could help him tap into Trump's loyal base of supporters. On the other hand, some Republicans might view Pence as too closely tied to Trump, which could hurt his chances among those looking for a fresh start or a more moderate approach. Lastly, the Republican National Convention's delegate selection process can be unpredictable, and a lot can happen between now and the convention. Candidates can rise or fall in popularity, and unexpected events can shift the momentum of the race.

Chris Christie, a former governor of New Jersey, has been a notable figure in the Republican Party but has faced challenges and criticisms, including from within his own party. His chances of becoming the nominee are relatively low compared to more prominent figures like Donald Trump or other potential candidates who might have broader party support.

The probability of Chris Christie not being the nominee is also high, given his lower profile and support within the party compared to other potential candidates.

Trump's influence over the party apparatus and his ability to shape the nomination process to his advantage are significant factors. 4.

However, it's also possible that these challenges could galvanize his base and strengthen his resolve to run. 5. Historical Precedents: While there are no direct historical precedents for a former president seeking the nomination after losing an election, Trump's unique political trajectory suggests that conventional wisdom may not apply. His ability to defy expectations has been a hallmark of his political career.

Current Political Involvement and Popularity: Donald Trump Jr. has been actively involved in politics, often speaking at rallies and events in support of his father, former President Donald Trump, and other Republican candidates. He has a strong following among a segment of the Republican base, which could be an advantage in a primary election. However, his appeal beyond his father's base is less clear. 2. Potential Competitors: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could be crowded, including possibly his father, former President Donald Trump, if he decides to run again. Other potential candidates might include former Vice President Mike Pence, various governors, senators, and other political figures. The competition within the Republican Party could dilute support for any single candidate, including Donald Trump Jr. 3. Historical Context: Historically, the Republican Party has shown a willingness to nominate candidates who are seen as the next in line or who have significant name recognition and support within the party establishment. However, the 2016 election showed a departure from this trend with the nomination of Donald Trump, indicating a possible shift in how the party selects its nominees. 4. Name Recognition and Fundraising Ability: Donald Trump Jr. benefits from high name recognition, thanks to his father's presidency and his own political activism. This could help him in early polling and fundraising, crucial components of a successful presidential campaign. 5. Policy and Personal Appeal: Beyond name recognition, a candidate's policy positions and personal appeal play significant roles in a presidential campaign. Donald Trump Jr. would need to articulate a compelling vision that resonates with a broad segment of the Republican Party and potentially with independent voters in a general election.

Firstly, as of my last update in 2023, Nikki Haley has announced her candidacy for the 2024 presidential election. She has a strong political background, having served as the Governor of South Carolina and the US Ambassador to the United Nations under President Donald Trump. Her experience and the fact that she has already launched her campaign could be seen as advantages in her bid for the nomination. However, the Republican field is likely to be crowded, with several other candidates either having announced their candidacy or rumored to be considering a run. This includes, but is not limited to, Donald Trump Sr., who has already announced his candidacy for the 2024 election. The presence of Trump Sr. significantly complicates the landscape for all other candidates, including Nikki Haley, due to his substantial base of support within the Republican Party. Regarding Donald Trump Jr., while he has been involved in his father's political campaigns and has been a vocal supporter of conservative causes, there has been less indication that he will run for the presidency in 2024, especially with his father in the race. However, until the Republican National Convention makes its selection, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out. Considering these factors, the probability of Nikki Haley securing the Republican nomination while Donald Trump Jr. does not involves assessing the likelihood of Haley outperforming all other potential candidates, including the significant challenge posed by Donald Trump Sr., and the less likely but still possible candidacy of Donald Trump Jr. Given the complexities and uncertainties in the Republican nomination process, and the long time frame until the election, making a precise prediction is challenging.

(a) Nikki Haley's chances of becoming the Republican nominee depend on various factors, including her popularity within the party, her performance in debates and primaries, and the overall political climate leading up to the 2024 election. As of my last update, Nikki Haley has announced her candidacy but faces competition from other candidates. Her success will depend on how well she resonates with Republican voters and whether she can distinguish herself from other contenders. (b) Francis Suarez, as of my last update, is less known nationally compared to Nikki Haley. His chances of becoming the Republican nominee would similarly depend on his performance in debates, primaries, and his appeal to Republican voters. However, with less national recognition, Suarez might face more significant challenges in securing the nomination compared to more established figures within the party. Considering both conditions, for the question to resolve as 'Yes,' Nikki Haley must win the nomination, and Francis Suarez must not. Given the competitive nature of the Republican primaries and the fact that these events are subject to a wide range of variables, including voter sentiment, campaign strategies, and unforeseen events, predicting the outcome with certainty is challenging. However, based on the information available and the general understanding of political trends, it can be reasoned that Nikki Haley has a more established national presence and political experience, which could give her an edge in the primaries. Meanwhile, Francis Suarez's less prominent national profile might make it more challenging for him to secure the nomination.

The BJP has been in power since 2014, with Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister, and has maintained a strong presence across various states. The INC has been trying to regain its footing after a significant decline in its electoral performance over the past decade. In the 2019 general elections, the BJP won 303 seats in the Lok Sabha, while the INC secured 52 seats. The formation of alliances and coalitions can significantly impact the outcome of the elections. The BJP has been part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which has helped it secure a majority, while the INC is exploring alliances with other opposition parties. Public sentiment, economic factors, and the role of regional parties are also crucial in determining the election outcome. Given these considerations, the BJP appears to have an advantage, but the INC is likely to put up a strong fight, especially if it can forge effective alliances.

Chris Christie, a former governor of New Jersey, has a more established political career but has faced challenges in gaining significant traction in his previous presidential bid. 2. Republican Party Dynamics: The Republican Party is currently dominated by figures like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, who have broader recognition and support within the party. The path to the nomination for Ramaswamy or Christie would require overcoming these more prominent figures. 3. Broader Political Landscape: The 2024 election will be influenced by a range of factors including the economy, foreign policy issues, and the performance of the incumbent administration. These factors can shift public opinion and influence the party's choice for a nominee. Given these considerations, while both Ramaswamy and Christie have unique strengths and could potentially gain traction under the right circumstances, the current landscape suggests that the odds are against them securing the nomination. The Republican Party tends to favor candidates with strong name recognition and broad support within the party, which currently leans towards other figures.

For the first event, given the context and the fact that there is a dedicated resolution source (The New York Times) tracking this information, it seems plausible that if a significant number of Democratic Senators were to call for Biden to drop out, it would be widely reported. However, without specific information on the current sentiments of Democratic Senators, it's challenging to estimate the likelihood of this event. Given the nature of political processes and the fact that such calls would be a significant political statement, it seems somewhat unlikely that a large number of Senators would take this step, especially given the short timeframe. For the second event, the context provided by Politico indicates that there is an organized effort among House Democrats to speak out against the early nomination plan, suggesting that there is significant discontent. However, the question specifies that fewer than 20 House/Senate Democrats need to sign a public letter opposing the plan for this event to occur. Given the indication of 'dozens' of House Democrats being involved in the effort to speak out, it seems likely that at least 20 could sign such a letter, especially considering the coordination and the strong feelings on the matter as reported. Considering both events, the first seems somewhat unlikely to occur due to the significant political implications and the lack of clear evidence suggesting a strong movement among Senators to call for Biden to drop out. The second event, based on the information provided, seems more likely not to occur as described (i.e., it seems likely that 20 or more Democrats could sign a letter opposing the early nomination plan).

As of the creation of this question (July 2, 2024), there are several factors at play, including President Biden's approval ratings, the state of the economy, and the upcoming presidential election. President Biden's approval ratings have been a subject of concern for Democrats, as they have been relatively low. However, it's essential to note that these ratings can fluctuate, and it's not uncommon for incumbent presidents to experience a dip in approval ratings during their term. Another factor is the state of the economy. While the economy has experienced growth under President Biden's administration, inflation and recession concerns have been rising. Economic woes can significantly impact a president's popularity and might lead some Senators to question whether President Biden is the best candidate to lead the party in the next election. Despite these challenges, President Biden has maintained strong support within the Democratic Party, particularly among key stakeholders and leaders. The party generally rallies around its incumbent president, and calls for a sitting president to drop out are extremely rare and usually only occur in extraordinary circumstances. Given these considerations, it seems unlikely that 10 or more Democratic Senators would publicly call for President Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024.

Luxembourg has not participated in Eurovision since 1993 but is set to return in 2024. Historically, Luxembourg has had a mixed record in the contest, with five wins but also several low placements. Given their long absence, it's difficult to predict their performance with certainty. However, their decision to return to the contest might indicate a renewed effort to perform well, potentially including selecting a strong entry or investing in their performance. Ireland, on the other hand, has been a regular participant in Eurovision but has seen a decline in success in recent years, failing to qualify for the Grand Final several times since the semi-final system was introduced in 2004. Despite this, Ireland has shown the ability to send strong entries that can compete at a high level, though consistency has been an issue. Given these considerations, the probability of Luxembourg qualifying for the Grand Final is somewhat uncertain but could be considered moderate, given the unknowns surrounding their return. Ireland's chances of failing to qualify are somewhat higher, based on recent trends, but it's also not a certainty given their potential to send a strong entry. To estimate the combined probability of both events happening, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event. Assuming a moderate chance for Luxembourg to qualify (around 0.5, considering the uncertainty) and a somewhat higher chance for Ireland to not qualify (around 0.6, given recent trends), the combined probability would be the product of these two probabilities.

Despite losing the 2020 presidential election, he has maintained a strong base of support among Republican voters. His influence over the party and his ability to raise funds are considerable advantages. 2. Potential Challengers: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 election includes several notable figures, such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence, among others. While these candidates have their own strengths and bases of support, Trump's name recognition, financial resources, and existing voter loyalty make him a formidable opponent in the primaries. 3. Political Climate: The political climate leading up to the 2024 election is expected to be highly polarized. Trump's candidacy would likely energize both his base and his opponents, potentially leading to a highly contested primary season. However, his ability to navigate controversy and maintain a core level of support has been a hallmark of his political career. 4. Legal and Health Factors: As of my last update, there are ongoing investigations and legal challenges involving Donald Trump. The outcomes of these could potentially impact his ability to run or his viability as a candidate. Additionally, the health of any candidate can become an issue during a campaign. Both these factors introduce elements of uncertainty into the equation.

Despite the controversies surrounding his presidency and post-presidency, he has a strong and dedicated supporter base. Ted Cruz, while not as universally known or polarizing as Trump, has also maintained a solid base within the Republican Party, particularly among conservative voters. 2. Potential Challengers: The field of potential Republican nominees for the 2024 election includes several other notable figures, such as Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, and possibly emerging candidates like Ron DeSantis. The strength and viability of these challengers could impact Trump's and Cruz's chances. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party's internal dynamics, including the influence of Trump on the party apparatus and the perspectives of party leaders, can significantly affect the nomination process. Trump's influence has reshaped the party in many ways, potentially giving him an advantage in the nomination process. 4. Primary Elections and Convention Dynamics: The outcome of primary elections and the rules governing the Republican National Convention (such as delegate allocation and potential rule changes) will directly influence the selection of the nominee. A candidate's ability to win over delegates and navigate the convention process is crucial. 5. External Factors: Economic conditions, the popularity of the incumbent president (if running for re-election), and unforeseen events can all sway voter sentiment and the party's decision-making process. Given these considerations: - Donald Trump's enduring popularity among a significant segment of the Republican base and his influence on the party make him a formidable candidate for the nomination. - Ted Cruz's consistent conservative stance and previous experience in running for the presidency could make him a viable alternative if Trump does not run or falters. - However, the presence of other strong contenders and the unpredictable nature of the primary process and convention dynamics introduce uncertainty. Therefore, considering the strong position of Trump within the party and Cruz's potential as a conservative alternative, but also acknowledging the uncertainties and the field of other contenders, the probability that either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election is estimated to be fairly high but not a certainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07046448252078176, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The probability that Kamala Harris's odds of winning will increase according to Nate Silver's model over the next week. 2. The probability that the 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee will be a woman. Let's analyze these events separately: 1. Kamala Harris's odds of winning increasing according to Nate Silver's model: This event is quite specific and depends on the dynamics of the electoral race as modeled by Nate Silver's team. An increase in Harris's odds would typically be driven by factors such as improved polling numbers, favorable news coverage, or significant endorsements. Given the fluid nature of electoral races and the relatively short timeframe (one week), predicting this outcome with high confidence is challenging. However, we can say that unless there is a significant event that would negatively impact Harris's campaign, her odds might see some level of fluctuation, potentially including an increase, given the natural variability in polling and electoral forecasting models. 2. The 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee being a woman: This event is broader and involves the overall dynamics of the Democratic Party's nomination process. The Democratic Party has shown a trend towards increased representation and nomination of women and minority candidates in recent years. However, the outcome of the nomination process depends on a multitude of factors, including the candidates' campaigns, voter turnout, and the preferences of the party's delegates. Predicting this outcome with certainty is difficult at this stage, especially without knowing the full slate of candidates and their relative strengths. Considering both events, we can see that predicting either with high confidence is challenging due to the uncertainties and variables involved. However, given the context and trends within the Democratic Party, as well as the potential for fluctuation in electoral odds, we can attempt to assign a probability. Given the information available and the inherent uncertainties in both electoral forecasting and nomination processes, I would lean towards a cautiously optimistic view regarding the potential for either event to occur, but with a clear understanding that predicting political outcomes is inherently uncertain."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.005405865368989571, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0018019551229965236, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1104731151721198, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

We will evaluate each event separately and then combine our assessments to provide a final probability. Event (a): Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024. Chasiv Yar is a location in Ukraine, and the question of whether Russia will have control over it on June 1, 2024, depends on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As of my last update in April 2024, the situation on the ground can change rapidly due to military operations. However, without specific, up-to-date information on the current military situation around Chasiv Yar, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. Generally, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) maps are a reliable source for assessing territorial control in Ukraine. If the conflict continues without significant changes in the area, we might expect that control could remain stable, but this is highly speculative. Given the lack of specific information and the volatility of the situation, I would cautiously estimate the probability of Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, based on the premise that significant changes in territorial control require substantial military efforts and considering the conflict's dynamic nature. Event (b): Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President before July 15, 2024. As of my last update, Joe Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election. For him to announce that he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024, would be a significant political development. Such decisions are typically made based on a variety of factors including health, political viability, and personal considerations. Given that Joe Biden has already shown a strong inclination to run, a reversal of this stance would be unexpected but not unprecedented in politics. The timing of such an announcement would also be critical, as it would significantly impact the Democratic Party's nomination process. Without specific information suggesting otherwise, the probability of Joe Biden making such an announcement before July 15, 2024, would be considered low, reflecting the current understanding of his intentions and the general stability of his decision-making process regarding his political career. Combining the Probabilities: To provide a final probability for the question, we need to consider that either event (a) or event (b) occurring would resolve the question as 'Yes.' The probabilities of these events are not mutually exclusive, but for simplicity, we will treat them as if they are because the overlap is likely minimal. Given the speculative nature of both assessments without current data, let's assign a placeholder probability for event (a) as 0.2 (reflecting the uncertainty and volatility of the conflict) and for event (b) as 0.05 (reflecting the current understanding of Joe Biden's intentions). The combined probability of either event happening would then be the sum of these probabilities, 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.13610709543579563, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04536903181193188, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5316817773513507, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Inclusion in the List of Approved Presidential Candidates: Ahmadinejad has a complex history with Iran's political establishment, having been disqualified in the past. Given this history, there's a significant chance that he might be disqualified again, especially if his candidacy is perceived as divisive. However, the opaque nature of Iranian politics makes predictions difficult. Probability of (a) occurring: I estimate this as relatively low, around 0.3. (b) Israel Does Not Carry Out a Deadly Attack Within Iran Before May 1, 2024: The relationship between Israel and Iran is tense, with a significant chance that Israel might conduct attacks, especially given the historical context. However, the specific timeframe and conditions narrow the scope. Probability of (b) occurring: I estimate this as moderate, around 0.6. Combining the Probabilities: To estimate the probability that both (a) and (b) occur, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening.

Understanding the Question: The question asks whether OpenAI or Anthropic will publish a public report by June 30, 2024, detailing the results of external red-teaming efforts on the safety of their AI models. Red-teaming is a process where a group (often external) simulates an adversary to test the defenses of an organization or, in this case, the safety and robustness of AI models. 2. Past Behavior and Trends: - OpenAI: OpenAI has a history of engaging with the broader research community and has shown a willingness to share its findings publicly. This includes publishing papers on its models, including potential vulnerabilities and efforts to improve their safety and robustness. - Anthropic: Similarly, Anthropic has demonstrated a commitment to AI safety and transparency, engaging in public discourse about the safety of its models and the broader AI ecosystem. 3. Current Landscape and Incentives: - The AI research community, especially those working on large models like OpenAI and Anthropic, face increasing pressure to demonstrate their commitment to safety and responsible AI development. This includes calls for more transparency around testing, including red-teaming, to ensure models are deployed responsibly. - Regulatory bodies and public opinion are also pushing for more transparency and accountability in AI development, which could incentivize companies to publish such reports to maintain public trust. 4. Challenges and Uncertainties: - Despite incentives for transparency, companies may be hesitant to publish results that could be perceived negatively or expose vulnerabilities in their models, which could impact their competitive edge or reputation. - The timing of such publications can be influenced by various factors, including the readiness of the report, strategic considerations, and the evolving regulatory landscape. Given these considerations, it seems plausible that at least one of these organizations would choose to publish the results of external red-teaming efforts by June 30, 2024, as a way to demonstrate their commitment to transparency and safety. However, predicting the exact actions of specific companies involves inherent uncertainty, especially considering the competitive and rapidly evolving nature of the AI field."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.2462746939435191, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0820915646478397, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6937612656492107, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, let's consider the probability of President Biden remaining in office through the end of July 2024. As of the last available information, President Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election in 2024, suggesting his commitment to remaining in office. The primary factors that could lead to him not remaining in office include resignation, incapacitation, or passing away. While these are possibilities, they are inherently unpredictable and, without specific evidence or reason to believe otherwise, are considered low-probability events for any given short-term period, especially given the President's current health and public stance. Secondly, regarding the possibility of Donald Trump being officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, this is a highly speculative scenario. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal or state office. For this to apply to Trump, there would need to be significant legal developments directly implicating him in such activities, followed by formal actions by a state or the federal government to invoke this clause. Given the divisive and politicized nature of such a move, and the lack of precedent for applying this clause in modern times, this scenario also seems unlikely without drastic new developments. Considering these factors, both scenarios individually appear to have low probabilities of occurring, though for different reasons. President Biden's continuation in office is the more straightforward scenario and has a higher likelihood due to the absence of any clear indicators suggesting his early departure. The removal of Donald Trump under the 14th Amendment is highly speculative and politically charged, making it a lower probability event. However, since the question asks for the probability that either of these events occurs, we must consider the combined probability. The probability of at least one of two independent events happening is the sum of their probabilities minus the product of their probabilities. Given the qualitative analysis: Let's assume a rough estimate for Biden remaining President through July 2024 as being quite high, around 0.8, given no specific reason to believe otherwise. The probability of Trump being removed under the 14th Amendment is much lower, let's estimate it as 0.05, given the highly speculative nature of this event. The combined probability (P) of either event happening would be: P = P(Biden remains) + P(Trump removed) - P(Biden remains) * P(Trump removed) P = 0.8 + 0.05 - (0.8 * 0.05) P = 0.85 - 0.04 P = 0.81 Therefore, the probability that either Biden remains President through July 2024 or Trump is removed from a primary ballot under the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, is approximately 0.81."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.09248165577087412, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Event (a) refers to the men's 100m dash winning time breaking the Olympic record of 9.63s. The current world record in the men's 100m dash is 9.48s, set by Usain Bolt in 2009. While it's possible for athletes to achieve remarkable times, especially in high-stakes competitions like the Olympics, the winning times in recent Olympics have been above 9.63s. For instance, at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the winning time was 9.80s. Given the current trends and performances in the sport, the likelihood of the Olympic record being broken seems moderate but not extremely high. Event (b) refers to Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals. The term 'Individual Neutral Athletes' likely refers to athletes competing under the Olympic flag or without their national flags due to various reasons such as sanctions against their countries. The number of gold medals won by such athletes can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances of each Olympics. However, winning 15 or more gold medals would be a significant achievement considering the broad range of sports and the global competition at the Olympics. Without specific data on the number of Individual Neutral Athletes participating and their distribution across different sports, it's challenging to estimate this probability accurately. However, intuitively, it seems like a low-probability event given the diverse and global nature of Olympic competitions. Combining these considerations, we have two events with what seems to be moderate to low probabilities. The overall probability of either event occurring would thus likely be higher than each individual probability but still not extremely high. Given the information and the subjective nature of these assessments, a precise numerical probability is challenging to determine without additional data. However, considering the general trends in athletics and the competitive nature of the Olympics, a reasonable estimate might lean towards the lower to moderate range for the combined probability of these two distinct events occurring."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.07178314889500087, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.023927716298333623, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.429682415449125, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

As one of the oldest serving presidents in U.S. history, speculation about his health and ability to serve another term is common. However, as of the last public information, despite some health issues, he has been deemed fit to serve by his doctors. 2. Political Climate and Approval Ratings: The political climate and Biden's approval ratings can influence his decision. Low approval ratings might discourage him from running again. However, approval ratings can fluctuate significantly over time, and decisions based on them can be risky. 3. Economic Conditions: The state of the economy in the lead-up to the 2024 election will significantly impact Biden's decision. A strong economy would support a re-election bid, while a struggling economy might make him reconsider. 4. Democratic Party Dynamics: The dynamics within the Democratic Party, including the presence of potential challengers and the party's overall performance in polls and elections leading up to 2024, will also play a role. A united party behind Biden would encourage a re-election bid, while significant opposition within the party could discourage him. 5. Personal Desire to Run: Ultimately, Biden's personal desire to run for re-election is a critical factor. His intentions have been somewhat unclear, with various statements that could be interpreted as either a willingness to run again or hesitation. Given these factors, predicting Biden's decision with certainty is challenging. However, considering his previous statements about being a transitional figure and the potential for fatigue after a long and challenging first term, there's a plausible scenario where he decides not to run again.

Historical Performance of Swimmers: Historically, swimmers have been among the top medal winners at the Olympics. Swimmers like Michael Phelps have set records for the most gold medals won by an individual in Olympic history. This suggests that swimming, as a sport, offers multiple medal opportunities, increasing the chances of a swimmer winning the most gold medals. 2. Number of Swimming Events: Swimming has a large number of events, with competitions in various strokes and distances for both men and women. This provides swimmers with more opportunities to win medals compared to sports with fewer events. 3. Competition and Talent Distribution: While swimming is a highly competitive sport, the distribution of talent across different sports at the Olympics can vary from one edition to another. The presence of exceptionally talented athletes in other sports could potentially challenge a swimmer's chances of winning the most gold medals. 4. Current Swimming Talent: As of the last available information before the 2024 Olympics, there are several highly talented swimmers competing. However, without specific details on the current form and performance levels of these athletes in the lead-up to the Olympics, it's challenging to pinpoint a dominant swimmer likely to outperform athletes from other sports. 5. Olympic Program Changes: The Olympic program evolves, with new sports and events being added and others removed. This could potentially impact the number of medals available in swimming relative to other sports, though swimming remains a core Olympic sport with a substantial number of events. Considering these factors, while it's reasonable to expect swimmers to perform well and potentially win a significant number of gold medals, the outcome depends on the performance of individual athletes across all sports at the 2024 Olympics.

Historical Context: It's essential to understand the trend of new countries winning their first Olympic gold medals in recent Olympic Games. While the exact numbers might vary, we know that each Olympics typically sees a few countries achieving this milestone. 2. Number of Participating Countries: The number of countries participating in the Olympics has been steadily increasing over the years. This increase in participation naturally raises the potential for more countries to win their first gold medal. 3. Emerging Talents and Sports: New sports and disciplines are occasionally added to the Olympic program. The inclusion of these new sports can provide opportunities for countries that might not have been competitive in traditional Olympic sports to win medals. 4. Competition Dynamics: The field of competition in certain sports can become more level due to various factors like global training programs, international competitions, and access to better training facilities and coaching. This leveling can lead to more diverse medal winners. 5. Specific Events and Favorites: Some countries might have strong contenders in specific sports or events where they haven't won a gold medal before but are favored to do so. Identifying these potential \"first-time\" gold medal winners requires a detailed look at the current international sports landscape. Given these considerations, it seems plausible that at least 5 countries could win their first-ever Olympic gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The Olympics often bring surprises, and the increasing global participation in sports suggests a trend towards a greater diversity of medal winners. However, without specific data on past trends or current strong contenders from countries that have yet to win a gold medal, it's challenging to provide a highly confident estimate.

First, consider event (a): At least 5 countries win their first-ever Olympic medal. The Olympics are a platform where new talent and countries can emerge. Given the diversity in participation and the fact that many countries have been improving their athletic programs, it's plausible that at least 5 countries could win their first Olympic medal. This includes countries that have never won a medal before but have shown potential in various sports. The expansion of the Olympic program to include new sports also increases the chances for more countries to win medals. Second, consider event (b): Fewer than 5 countries win their first-ever Olympic gold medal. Winning a gold medal is significantly more challenging than winning any medal. It requires a country to have an athlete or team that is the absolute best in their sport, which is a high bar for countries that have never achieved this level of success before. While it's possible for new countries to break through, the top spots in many Olympic sports are highly competitive and often dominated by established powers. Considering both events together, the likelihood of at least 5 countries winning their first Olympic medal seems reasonable given the increasing global participation and competitiveness in sports. However, the likelihood of fewer than 5 countries winning their first gold medal also seems reasonable due to the high bar of achieving a gold medal. Given these considerations, the probability that both events occur seems moderate. It's not extremely likely because of the challenging nature of winning a first gold medal, but it's also not extremely unlikely because the conditions for both events are plausible in the context of increasing global athletic competitiveness."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "b9f19a33-0614-4c2d-a12d-923b38b8a51d", "title": "Will at least 5 countries win either their debut gold medal or their first Olympic medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if at least 5 countries win either their first-ever Olympic gold medal or their first-ever Olympic medal at the Paris Olympics, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).", "resolution_date": "2024-08-11T18:20:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-27T18:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "The Olympics are inherently unpredictable, but past trends suggest that new countries can and do break through to win their first medals or gold medals.

Condition (a): France places in the top 5 of the medal table. France has historically been a strong competitor in the Olympics, often placing within the top 5 or close to it in the overall medal count. Home advantage: The Olympics being held in Paris could give French athletes an edge due to familiarity with the environment and potentially stronger crowd support. However, the performance of countries can vary significantly from one Olympics to the next based on a wide range of factors including changes in athlete performance, new sports or events being added, and geopolitical factors affecting participation. Condition (b): Sha'Carri Richardson fails to win a gold medal in any event. Sha'Carri Richardson is a highly talented sprinter with the potential to win gold medals in her events. The women's 100m and 4x100m relay are highly competitive events with several athletes and teams capable of winning gold, making it challenging for any single athlete to guarantee a win. Factors such as athlete form, potential injuries, and the dynamics of relay team selections can affect the outcome. Considering these points: For condition (a), it seems plausible that France will place in the top 5, given historical performance and the home advantage. However, the competitive nature of the Olympics means there are no guarantees. For condition (b), while Sha'Carri Richardson is a strong competitor, the nature of her events means there is always a chance she might not win a gold medal due to the high level of competition. To assign a probability, we need to consider the likelihood of both independent events happening. Assuming a somewhat optimistic view for France's chances and acknowledging the competitive nature of Richardson's events, a simplified approach might be to assign a probability for each event and then multiply them together for the combined probability. Given the subjective nature of these predictions and without precise data on current performance levels or historical probabilities, a rough estimate could be: Condition (a): 60% chance of France placing in the top 5. Condition (b): 40% chance of Sha'Carri Richardson not winning a gold medal, considering the high level of competition. The combined probability of both conditions occurring would then be 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.

(a) Biden drops out before July 20: As of the last update, there's no strong indication that President Biden intends to drop out of the race. His campaign and the Democratic Party have shown continued support for his candidacy. Historically, it's rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election campaign, especially without significant health issues or scandal, neither of which are prominently affecting Biden's campaign as of the last update. Given the proximity to the election and the lack of any significant indicators of Biden intending to drop out, it's reasonable to assess this probability as low. (b) Kamala Harris picks Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro as her VP by August 7: As of the last update, there's been no official announcement from Kamala Harris regarding her choice of running mate. Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are both prominent figures within the Democratic Party, with Kelly being a senator and Shapiro being the Governor of Pennsylvania. However, the choice of VP can depend on a wide array of factors including but not limited to geographical balance, ideological balance, and personal chemistry. Without inside information or a clear pattern of behavior from Harris that would indicate a preference for Kelly or Shapiro specifically, it's challenging to assign a high probability to this specific choice. However, it's also worth noting that Harris might choose a running mate based on strategic considerations, and both Kelly and Shapiro could potentially offer strategic advantages. Combining these considerations, the probability that either event occurs is the sum of the probabilities of each event minus the probability of both occurring (to correct for double-counting the intersection). However, given the lack of evidence supporting either scenario strongly, and the specificity of the scenarios, the probabilities of each individual event are low, and the probability of both occurring is negligible. Given these considerations, a generous estimate for part (a) might be around 0.05 (5%), given the rarity of such an event and the lack of indicators supporting it. For part (b), without clear evidence of preference for Kelly or Shapiro, a reasonable estimate might be slightly higher, around 0.1 (10%), acknowledging the strategic potential of such a choice but also the wide field of potential candidates. Adding these probabilities together without accounting for the negligible overlap gives us a combined probability of 0.15 (15%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.024550522664683994, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.008183507554894665, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.22066664969829708, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) If Joe Biden drops out, will a reliable media outlet cover the story at least 6 hours in advance? - Media Coverage Dynamics: Major, reliable media outlets such as the Associated Press News, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Reuters, and Washington Post have extensive networks and resources dedicated to covering significant political developments. The decision of a sitting President to drop out of a presidential race would be a monumental story, likely to be covered extensively. - Advance Notice: Given the nature of such a significant story, it is plausible that rumors or unofficial confirmations would circulate within the media circles hours, if not days, before an official announcement. Media outlets often have sources within political circles that can provide early warnings of such decisions. - Assessment: Given the resources and networks of major media outlets, it is highly likely that they would cover the story of Joe Biden dropping out with at least 6 hours of advance notice before any official announcement. (b) Will there be no more Democratic party presidential debates? - Debate Scheduling: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) typically organizes debates for the Democratic nominees. The decision to hold debates depends on various factors, including the number of candidates, the stage of the election cycle, and strategic considerations. - Debate Necessity: Debates are crucial for lesser-known candidates to gain visibility and for all candidates to differentiate themselves on policy issues. However, if the field narrows significantly or if the party feels that debates could cause more harm than good (e.g., by highlighting party divisions), they might decide against holding further debates. - Assessment: Without knowing the specific circumstances (e.g., the number of candidates, the dynamics of the race), it's difficult to predict with certainty whether there will be more debates. However, given the typical role of debates in the nomination process, it's somewhat likely that there will be at least one more debate, especially if the field remains competitive. Overall Assessment: For part (a), it's highly likely that a reliable media outlet would cover Joe Biden's dropout with at least 6 hours of advance notice. For part (b), while there's a possibility of no more debates, it's somewhat less likely given the typical importance of debates in the nomination process.

Current Team Dynamics and Talent: As of the 2023-2024 season, the Knicks have shown improvement with players like Julius Randle and Jalen Brunson leading the team. However, when comparing their roster to top contenders in the league, they might lack the depth and superstar talent that typically characterizes NBA championship teams. 3. Eastern Conference Competition: The Eastern Conference is highly competitive, with teams like the Boston Celtics, Milwaukee Bucks, and Philadelphia 76ers, who have consistently shown stronger performances and deeper playoff runs in recent years. The Knicks would need to surpass these teams in the playoffs to reach the NBA Finals. 4. Western Conference Strength: Should the Knicks make it to the NBA Finals, they would face a Western Conference team. The West has been incredibly strong, with teams like the Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, and Phoenix Suns, boasting rosters filled with top-tier talent. The challenge of beating such teams in a seven-game series is formidable. 5. Injuries and Team Chemistry: The impact of injuries and team chemistry cannot be overstated. A significant injury to a key player or poor team chemistry could derail any team's championship aspirations.

Past Performance: Historically, neither the Knicks nor the Clippers have been consistent NBA Finals contenders. The Knicks have not won an NBA championship since 1973, and their last NBA Finals appearance was in 1999. The Clippers have never appeared in an NBA Finals in their Los Angeles era and last won a championship in 1954 when they were based in Rochester. 2. Current Roster Strength: Both teams have shown promise with their current rosters. The Knicks have built a solid core around Julius Randle and Jalen Brunson, showing significant improvement in recent seasons. The Clippers, meanwhile, boast a star-studded lineup featuring Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, but their success has been heavily influenced by the health of these key players. 3. Potential Opponents: The NBA is highly competitive, with several teams that could realistically win the championship. The path to the Finals for both the Knicks and Clippers would likely involve overcoming teams that have been more consistent in recent years, such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets, and Phoenix Suns. 4. Significant Changes: The offseason and trade deadlines can significantly alter a team's chances. Both the Knicks and Clippers might make moves to strengthen their rosters, but so could their competitors. Given these considerations, while both teams have the potential to make deep playoff runs, the competition for the NBA championship is fierce. The Knicks and Clippers would need to demonstrate significant improvement and consistency, as well as favorable health and chemistry, to be considered top contenders.

Historical Context: Israel and Iran have a long history of conflict, with tensions escalating significantly since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Israel has been concerned about Iran's nuclear program and has taken covert actions to disrupt it, including the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and cyberattacks on nuclear facilities. 2. Recent Tensions: In recent years, there have been numerous incidents that could be interpreted as a ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries. These include airstrikes attributed to Israel against Iranian targets in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, as well as Iran's increasing support for militant groups in the region that are hostile to Israel. 3. Current Geopolitical Landscape: The current geopolitical landscape is complex, with the United States and other Western countries seeking to negotiate a return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018. Israel has been a vocal critic of the JCPOA and has threatened to take unilateral action against Iran's nuclear program if it believes the international community is not doing enough to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 4. Timeframe: The timeframe for the question is relatively short, from the publication date to May 1, 2024. This limits the window for such an attack to occur, but it does not eliminate the possibility, especially given the unpredictability of the situation. 5. Credible Reports and Attribution: The question specifies that the attack must be attributed to Israel and result in the death of at least five individuals within Iran's borders. Attribution can sometimes be difficult, as countries may not always claim responsibility for such actions. However, given the history of the conflict and the openness with which Israel has discussed its intentions to act against Iranian nuclear and military targets, attribution to Israel in the event of such an attack is plausible. Given these considerations, while there are certainly reasons to believe that Israel might carry out an attack against targets in Iran, predicting such an event with certainty is challenging. The probability of such an attack occurring before May 1, 2024, is difficult to quantify due to the complex and dynamic nature of the situation.

Historically, the Core CPI has shown a tendency to increase, but the rate of increase can vary significantly from month to month. The Core CPI excludes food and energy prices, which can be volatile, but it still captures a wide range of goods and services that contribute to the overall inflation rate. As of the last available data before the question was posed (June 2024), the US economy has been experiencing a mix of inflationary and deflationary pressures. The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased demand for goods and services, which can push prices higher. However, supply chain improvements and a strong labor market might also contribute to economic stability, potentially mitigating rapid price increases. Given these considerations, while it's reasonable to expect some level of inflation, predicting an increase of more than 0.1% specifically for July is challenging without more detailed, up-to-date information on the current economic conditions, such as changes in consumer behavior, production costs, or monetary policy. Therefore, based on general historical trends and the mixed economic signals, the probability that the seasonally adjusted Core CPI for July 2024 increases by more than 0.1% compared to June 2024 is somewhat above a neutral guess, reflecting a modest expectation of inflation but also acknowledging the uncertainty."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "2ae29f58-a765-4640-8cae-cf6f99f91d45", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024 (b) The Month-over-Month US Core CPI increase by 0.1% or less in July 2024?", "body": "(a) Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024: Resolves YES if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) invokes Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time).

His experience could be beneficial, but his past inability to gain significant traction might indicate challenges in garnering broad support within the party. 2. Current Political Landscape: The Republican Party has undergone significant changes since Christie's last run, with a notable shift towards candidates who more vocally support the policies and persona of former President Donald Trump. Christie, known for his more moderate stance on certain issues and his criticisms of Trump, might find it challenging to appeal to the party's base in its current form. 3. Potential Candidates: The field of potential candidates for the 2024 Republican nomination could include figures closely aligned with Trump or those who have built a strong national following among Republicans. Christie would need to compete against these candidates, some of whom might have stronger grassroots support or more significant financial backing. 4. Public Perception and Approval: Christie's public image has been impacted by various factors, including the Bridgegate scandal and his subsequent legal issues. While he has maintained a presence in political discourse, particularly through his role as a commentator, his appeal to a broad national audience is uncertain. 5. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party's dynamics and what it seeks in a candidate for the 2024 election will significantly influence Christie's chances. If the party prioritizes a candidate with executive experience and a track record of working across the aisle, Christie might have an advantage. However, if the party continues to favor candidates closely aligned with Trump's policies and style, Christie's prospects might be dimmer.

First, let's consider Chris Christie becoming the Republican nominee. As of my last update, Chris Christie, a former governor of New Jersey, has not been a leading figure in the polls for the Republican nomination. The Republican field is typically crowded, and Christie's popularity and political influence have waned since his last presidential bid in 2016. The likelihood of him securing the nomination would depend on a variety of factors, including the strategies of other candidates, his fundraising capabilities, and his performance in debates and primaries. Given the current landscape and his past performance, the probability seems low. Second, let's consider Joe Biden dropping out before July 13, 2024. President Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election. The decision for an incumbent president to drop out would be extraordinary and typically would be influenced by health issues, severe political pressure, or personal reasons. While unforeseen circumstances can always arise, as of now, there is no strong indication that President Biden plans to or will be forced to drop out of the race. Combining these considerations, the probability of either event happening is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of both happening together (to avoid double-counting the intersection). However, since the scenarios are largely independent (Christie's nomination does not directly influence Biden's decision to drop out and vice versa), and both individual probabilities are low, the probability of both occurring is negligible. Given the current information and without specific probabilities to assign to each event, we can qualitatively assess that both are unlikely. However, to adhere to the format and provide a quantitative estimate, let's consider the following rough estimates: Chris Christie becoming the Republican nominee: Very low, let's say around 2% given the crowded field and his current political standing. Joe Biden dropping out: Also low, let's estimate around 5% considering his stated intentions and the absence of strong indicators for him to do so.

However, health concerns, significant political scandals, or severe campaign mismanagement could potentially lead to a candidate dropping out.

Current Trends and Practices: The AI industry is under increasing scrutiny for the safety and ethical implications of its models. Companies like Inflection are more likely to engage in practices that demonstrate a commitment to safety, including external audits or red-teaming exercises, to build trust and comply with potential regulations. 2. Red-teaming as a Practice: Red-teaming is a practice that involves simulating real-world attacks on a system to identify vulnerabilities. It's a valuable tool for improving the security and safety of AI models. Given its utility, it's plausible that Inflection would consider external red-teaming as a method to assure the robustness of their models. 3. External Pressure and Transparency: There's growing external pressure on AI companies to be more transparent about their safety practices. Publishing the results of external red-teaming exercises could be seen as a way for Inflection to demonstrate transparency and a commitment to safety. 4. Resource and Time Considerations: Conducting external red-teaming and preparing a report by June 30, 2024, requires significant resources and time. The feasibility of completing such a task within the given timeframe depends on when the process starts and the complexity of the models being tested. 5. Company Culture and Priorities: Inflection's willingness to engage in and publish the results of external red-teaming exercises also depends on the company's culture and priorities. If safety and transparency are high on their list, it's more likely they will follow through with such initiatives.

Legislative Framework for a Referendum: For Scotland to hold an official, sanctioned referendum on independence, it needs the consent of the UK government due to the Scotland Act 2016, which requires an agreement between the Scottish and UK governments for such a vote to be legally binding. The Scottish Parliament can pass a bill to hold a referendum, but for it to be considered 'sanctioned,' the UK Parliament must also agree. 2. Political Will and Recent Developments: The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has been leading the push for independence, has a majority in the Scottish Parliament alongside the Scottish Greens, who also support independence. This indicates a strong political will within Scotland for a referendum. However, the UK government, led by the Conservative Party, has shown reluctance to grant the necessary permission, citing the need for a longer period to pass since the last referendum in 2014 and concerns about the economic implications. 3. Legal and Procedural Challenges: Even if the Scottish Parliament decides to hold a referendum without the explicit consent of the UK government, there would likely be legal challenges. The UK Supreme Court could be asked to rule on whether such a referendum would be within the powers of the Scottish Parliament, adding uncertainty to the process. 4. Public Opinion and Pressure: Public opinion in Scotland and the rest of the UK could influence the decision. If there is a significant shift in favor of independence in Scotland, it might increase pressure on the UK government to reconsider its stance. However, public opinion can be volatile, and predicting shifts is challenging. 5. Timeframe: The question specifies that the referendum must be held before May 3, 2024. Given the complexities and potential legal challenges involved, the timeframe is relatively short for all necessary steps to be taken, especially considering the need for agreement between the Scottish and UK governments.

Regarding the first event, as of my last update, there's no clear indication that Donald Trump Jr. is a leading candidate for the Republican nomination. The Republican field for the 2024 election could include a variety of candidates, and without current, specific polling data or primary results indicating Donald Trump Jr.'s likelihood of winning the nomination, it's difficult to assess his chances accurately. However, given the historical context and the typical candidates considered in the running, it might be considered a long shot without further information. For the second event, the scenario hinges on the hypothetical situation where Joe Biden drops out of the race. The question specifies that for it to resolve as 'Yes,' no reliable media outlet should cover the story with an unofficial confirmation at least 6 hours before the official announcement. Given the nature of modern news cycles and the extensive coverage of significant political events, it seems highly unlikely that no major media outlet would have any advance notice or report on such a significant development. Major media outlets often have well-placed sources within political circles and are typically adept at breaking news of this magnitude before official announcements. Considering both parts of the question, the first seems unlikely without specific evidence pointing to Donald Trump Jr.'s strong candidacy for the Republican nomination.

Character Popularity and Franchise Success: Both Deadpool and Wolverine are highly popular characters in the X-Men franchise, with a strong fan base. The success of previous films, especially 'Deadpool' (2016), which broke multiple box office records for an R-rated film, suggests a strong potential for their combined outing. 2. Marketing and Hype: The marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' would likely capitalize on the popularity of both characters, potentially generating significant hype. This could lead to a strong opening weekend as fans and curious viewers flock to theaters to see the characters interact on the big screen. 3. Box Office Trends: The box office performance of superhero movies has generally been strong in recent years, with many films in the genre breaking records and achieving high opening weekends. This trend suggests a favorable environment for 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' 4. Competition: The release date of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' and the competitive landscape at the time of its release would also impact its box office performance. A release window with minimal competition from other blockbuster films could help it achieve a higher opening weekend. 5. Inflation and Ticket Price Increases: Since the release of 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'The Wolverine' (2013), ticket prices have increased due to inflation and other factors. This means that even if 'Deadpool & Wolverine' sells the same number of tickets as its predecessors, it could still achieve a higher box office total due to higher ticket prices. Considering these factors, it seems plausible that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could achieve a higher domestic box office opening than the combined openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine.'

First, let's examine the box office prospects of 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' The combined domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'The Wolverine' (2013) is $185,548,391. For 'Deadpool & Wolverine' to surpass this, it would need to leverage the popularity of both characters effectively and likely benefit from a well-executed marketing campaign, favorable release date, and positive word-of-mouth. Given the success of the individual films and the general trend of superhero movies performing well at the box office, there's a reasonable chance 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could achieve this, especially considering the inflation in ticket prices over the years and the potential for increased interest due to the combination of the two popular characters. However, estimating box office performance is inherently uncertain due to numerous factors, including competition, marketing effectiveness, and audience reception. Second, we consider the probability of 'Trap' (2024) receiving a CinemaScore of B or above. CinemaScore is a measure of audience reaction, and achieving a B or higher indicates a generally positive response. Without specific details about 'Trap,' such as its genre, director, cast, or early reviews, it's challenging to estimate its performance accurately. However, a B CinemaScore is not exceptionally high, and many films achieve this level of audience approval. Therefore, unless 'Trap' has factors strongly indicating a poor reception, there's a reasonable likelihood it could achieve a B or higher CinemaScore. Given these considerations, we are estimating the probability of either event occurring without precise data on the films' production quality, marketing campaigns, release dates, or early reviews. However, considering general trends and the popularity of superhero movies, along with the moderate bar for audience approval for 'Trap,' there's a basis for optimism regarding the question resolving as 'Yes.'"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04082239798368925, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.013607465994563084, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5387219276538799, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) FiveThirtyEight projects Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This part of the question hinges on the forecasting model used by FiveThirtyEight. Their models generally incorporate a wide range of data, including polling data, economic indicators, and historical trends. As of my last update in 2023, it's difficult to predict with certainty how these factors will evolve. However, we can consider a few general points: Polling: If Biden maintains a lead in the polls, especially in key battleground states, this would favor him being projected as the favorite. Economic Indicators: The state of the economy in mid-2024 will also play a crucial role. A strong economy tends to favor the incumbent. Historical Trends: Some historical trends suggest that incumbents have an advantage, though this can be influenced by many factors, including the incumbent's popularity and the challenger's appeal. Given these factors, without more specific data, it's challenging to assign a precise probability, but we can speculate based on historical trends that an incumbent president often has an advantage in projections as the election nears, assuming no major crises or downturns. (b) Francis Suarez not being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of my last update, Francis Suarez, the Mayor of Miami, has not been considered a front-runner for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election. The Republican field is likely to include several candidates, with figures like Donald Trump and potentially others like Ron DeSantis often being mentioned as more likely nominees. Given the current political landscape, it seems more probable than not that Suarez will not be the nominee, as he lacks the national profile and the level of party support that typically characterizes a successful nominee. Combining (a) and (b): To estimate the combined probability of both events happening, we would ideally multiply the probabilities of each event if they were independent. However, these events are not entirely independent; for instance, if Biden is projected as a strong favorite, it might reflect weaker Republican candidates, including Suarez not being the nominee. However, without precise probabilities for each event, we can reason qualitatively: Event (a) is uncertain but leans towards Biden being favored, given historical incumbent advantages and assuming no significant downturns. Event (b) seems more likely, as Suarez is not currently considered a leading candidate for the Republican nomination. Given these considerations, a rough estimate might lean towards a higher probability for the combined event, reflecting the seeming likelihood of Suarez not being the nominee and the potential for Biden to be favored in projections. However, the exact probability is highly speculative without more current data.

The Republican Party's nomination process is complex and involves primary elections and caucuses across the United States, culminating in the Republican National Convention where the nominee is officially selected. For Tucker Carlson to be the nominee, he would have to either win the primary elections convincingly or emerge as a compromise candidate at the convention. Given the competition and the lack of indication from Carlson that he intends to run, the probability of this scenario is relatively low. (b) Biden Dropping Out Before July 20: Joe Biden, as the incumbent President, would have to face extraordinary circumstances to drop out of the race before the Democratic National Convention. While health issues, personal scandals, or extreme political pressure could potentially lead to such a decision, there is no current indication that any of these scenarios are likely to occur. The Democratic Party would also likely resist any effort for Biden to step down unless absolutely necessary, given the advantages of incumbency in a presidential election. Therefore, the probability of Biden dropping out is also relatively low.

For event (a), \"The domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is higher than that of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' combined,\" we need to consider several factors: 1. Franchise Popularity and Growth: The popularity of the Deadpool and Wolverine franchises has been significant, with both characters being fan favorites in the X-Men universe. The success of previous films, especially the Deadpool movies, indicates a strong fan base that is likely to support a new installment. 2. Inflation and Box Office Trends: The box office performance of movies generally increases over time due to inflation, growing audiences, and sometimes changes in ticket prices. However, recent trends have also shown shifts in viewer habits, with streaming services becoming more popular, potentially affecting box office numbers. 3. Marketing and Hype: The marketing campaign for \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" will play a significant role in generating buzz and attracting a large audience. Given the popularity of the characters, a well-executed marketing strategy could significantly boost the opening weekend numbers. Considering these factors, it's plausible that \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" could have a higher opening weekend than the combined openings of \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine,\" especially considering the inflation and the potential for a strong marketing campaign. For event (b), \"Taylor Swift does not cameo in 'Deadpool & Wolverine',\" we consider: 1. Cameo Trends: Celebrity cameos in superhero movies have become more common, but they are usually kept secret until the movie's release to maintain surprise and generate additional buzz. 2. Taylor Swift's Acting Career: Taylor Swift has made appearances in a few projects, but her acting career is not as extensive as her music career. A cameo in a major film like \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" would be a notable event but not entirely outside the realm of possibility. 3. No Prior Connection: There's no prior connection or hint that Taylor Swift would be involved in \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\" The criteria for resolving this as YES are quite strict, requiring no appearance, voice role, or credible sources indicating her involvement. Given these points, it's more likely than not that Taylor Swift will not have a cameo in \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" simply due to the lack of any indication or precedent for her involvement in such a project. Combining the Estimates: For event (a), considering the popularity of the franchises and the potential for a strong marketing campaign, I would estimate a probability of around 0.6 (60%) that the domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" will be higher than that of \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine\" combined. For event (b), given the lack of any indication of Taylor Swift's involvement and the strict criteria for resolving this as YES, I would estimate a probability of around 0.8 (80%) that Taylor Swift does not cameo in \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\" Final Probability: To find the probability that both events occur, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.6 (event a) * 0.8 (event b) = 0.48.

However, Apple has a highly diversified product line, including the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and a growing services sector, which provides a stable source of revenue. While it's possible that Nvidia could experience rapid growth, especially if AI and ML continue to expand into new areas of the tech industry, it's also important to note that Apple's market position is incredibly strong, and it would take a significant shift in market dynamics for Nvidia to surpass Apple in market capitalization within a relatively short period.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that the market needs 78 more traders to reach the target. Assuming that the market has been growing steadily since its creation on May 30, we can estimate the average daily growth rate. Let's assume that the market had 0 traders on May 30 and has been growing linearly since then. As of July 15, the market would have been open for approximately 46 days. To reach 377 traders, the market would need to have an average daily growth rate of approximately 8.2 traders per day (377 traders / 46 days). This growth rate seems relatively high, but it's not impossible. However, without more information on the market's current traction, user engagement, and overall popularity, it's difficult to make a more accurate estimate.

Understanding the Source of the Data: The question relies on the national polling average for the 2024 presidential election as reported by 538 (FiveThirtyEight), a well-known data-driven news site focused on political analysis. Their polling averages are considered reliable because they aggregate data from multiple polls, adjusting for factors like sample size, pollster quality, and recency. 2. Interpreting the Polling Average: The question specifies that a positive value indicates a Trump lead, and a negative value indicates a Biden lead. We are interested in a scenario where Trump's lead is greater than 2 but less than or equal to 3 points on July 15, 2024. 3. Considering the Volatility of Polls: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological adjustments by the pollsters. However, significant shifts in a short period are less common, especially in a general election scenario where opinions might be more stable compared to primary elections. 4. Assessing the Time Frame: The question was created on July 9, 2024, and is set to resolve based on data accessed on July 17, 2024. This means we are looking at a relatively short time frame, which generally suggests less potential for dramatic shifts in public opinion. 5. Considering External Factors: Events such as debates, major policy announcements, or significant news stories could potentially sway public opinion. However, without specific knowledge of such events occurring between July 9 and July 15, it's challenging to predict their impact. 6. Making an Informed Estimate: Given the short time frame and the absence of information about specific events that could significantly alter the polling average, a cautious approach is to assume a degree of stability. However, predicting a lead within a narrow range (greater than 2 but less than or equal to 3 points) is inherently challenging due to the natural fluctuation in polls. Given these considerations, and without access to the current polling data or specific events that might influence it, the probability of Trump's lead being within this exact range on July 15, 2024, is difficult to estimate with high confidence. However, acknowledging the general stability of polling averages over short periods and the specificity of the question, a moderate to low probability might be an appropriate estimate."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "2d3353b2-7885-4270-9108-57819cdee7b7", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) be higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024, and (b) Trump's lead over Biden be less than or equal to 2 or greater than 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve based on reporting by the St. Louis Fed here: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VXVCLS.

For (a), predicting the exact movement of volatility indices like VXVCLS is challenging due to the multitude of factors that can influence market volatility, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. However, we can observe historical trends and current market conditions to make an educated guess. As of the last available data before the question was created, if the overall market conditions were indicating an increase in volatility due to economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or other factors, it might suggest a higher probability of the VXVCLS being higher year-over-year. Without specific data or recent trends provided in the question, it's difficult to assign a precise probability, but let's assume a moderate increase in volatility is plausible given the general uncertainty in global markets. For (b), predicting the exact lead of one political candidate over another within a specific margin requires analyzing numerous factors, including recent polling trends, political events, and how these might sway public opinion. The condition specified here creates a narrow window for resolution (a lead of less than or equal to 2 or greater than 3), which complicates the prediction. Political polling averages can fluctuate based on a variety of factors including but not limited to debates, campaign strategies, and external events. Given the specificity of the margin and without current polling data or trends, assigning a precise probability is challenging. However, it's generally understood that polls can fluctuate, and such specific margins can be sensitive to various influences, potentially making this condition somewhat less likely than a broader margin. Considering both conditions must be met for the question to resolve to 'yes,' and given the uncertainties and complexities involved in predicting both market volatility indices and political polling averages with such specificity, the probability of both occurring seems relatively low.

Event (a): The Philadelphia 76ers win the 2024 NBA Finals. The NBA is highly competitive, with many strong teams vying for the championship each year. As of my last update in 2023, the Philadelphia 76ers, led by Joel Embiid, have been a strong contender in the Eastern Conference but have not yet made it to the NBA Finals in recent years. The team's performance can be influenced by factors such as player injuries, trades, and the overall team dynamics. Given the competitive nature of the NBA and the difficulty in predicting future team performance with certainty, the probability of the 76ers winning the 2024 NBA Finals is relatively low. However, they are a strong team with potential, so it's not an impossible feat. Event (b): The United States fails to win gold in either Men's or Women's 5v5 basketball at the Paris Olympics. The United States has historically been very dominant in basketball at the Olympics, with both the men's and women's teams having a long history of winning gold medals. However, the international basketball landscape has become increasingly competitive, with countries like Australia, Spain, and others fielding strong teams. Despite the growing competition, the U.S. teams are still considered favorites to win gold in both men's and women's basketball. However, upsets can happen, especially in a single-elimination tournament format like the Olympics. Combining the Probabilities: To estimate the probability of both events occurring (the 76ers winning the NBA Finals and the U.S. failing to win gold in either basketball event at the Olympics), we need to multiply the probabilities of each event occurring. Given the competitive nature of both the NBA and the Olympics, and considering the historical dominance of the U.S. in basketball, let's assign some rough estimates: - The probability of the 76ers winning the 2024 NBA Finals might be around 5% to 10%, given the competitive field and the difficulty of predicting sports outcomes. - The probability of the U.S. failing to win gold in either men's or women's basketball could be slightly higher, perhaps around 20% to 30%, considering the possibility of upsets and the growing strength of international teams. Using these rough estimates, the combined probability would be the product of these two ranges, which would be quite low, indicating the difficulty of both events happening together. Final Estimate: Given the speculative nature of sports predictions and the complexity of factors influencing team performance, the actual probability could vary widely.

As of my last update, the field of Democratic candidates for the 2024 election is not overly crowded with strong contenders, which might reduce the likelihood of a brokered convention. 2. Party Rules: The Democratic Party's rules for delegate allocation and the primary process can influence the likelihood of a brokered convention.

Delegate Threshold: The Democratic Party requires candidates to meet a 15% threshold in a primary or caucus to be eligible for delegates. This threshold can help to concentrate delegates among fewer candidates, potentially reducing the likelihood of a brokered convention. 4. Historical Context: Brokered conventions are rare in modern U.S. politics, especially for the Democratic Party. The last brokered convention for the Democrats was in 1952. The rarity of such events suggests a natural tendency within the party to coalesce around a candidate before the convention. 5. Current Political Climate: The political climate and voter sentiment can also play a significant role. If there is a strong desire for party unity in the face of the general election, there might be more pressure for candidates to drop out or for delegates to coalesce around a single candidate before the convention. Considering these factors, while it's impossible to predict with certainty, the conditions that typically lead to a brokered convention (a crowded field of strong candidates and a highly contentious primary process) do not seem to be strongly present as of my last update. However, the political landscape can change rapidly, and unexpected events could still lead to a scenario where no candidate achieves a majority on the first ballot."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "7a912e80-ee14-4d6e-b461-2fc081dae9d5", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) 10 or more Democratic Senators call for Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024, and (b) Democrats do not have a brokered convention in 2024?", "body": "(a) Resolution source: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/biden-drop-out-democrats.html\n\nIf at any point before midnight July 20 Central Time, it shows 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out, this condition will resolve to yes.

Invocation Mechanism: For the 25th Amendment Section 4 to be invoked, the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet must agree that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. This is a high threshold, as it requires consensus among the Vice President and a significant portion of the Cabinet. 2. Precedent and Rarity: The invocation of the 25th Amendment Section 4 is extremely rare. Historically, it has never been used to permanently remove a President from office due to incapacity. This suggests a high level of reluctance among officials to take such a drastic step, which could be perceived as a constitutional crisis. 3. Current Political Context: The question mentions a GOP lawmaker asking Merrick Garland to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Biden from office. However, this request itself does not indicate a serious movement within the Cabinet or among high-ranking officials to invoke the amendment. It could be seen as a political maneuver rather than a genuine concern for the President's capacity to serve. 4. Health and Capacity of President Biden: As of the last available information, there has been no credible indication that President Biden's health or mental capacity has deteriorated to the point where he could be considered unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Given these considerations, the likelihood of the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or another relevant body) invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to declare President Biden incapacitated before August 2024 is low.

Event (a): OpenAI publicly commits to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle before July 1, 2024. OpenAI has been under increasing scrutiny regarding its approach to transparency and safety. The 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle is a key demand from experts and researchers in the AI safety community. Given the growing pressure and the importance of demonstrating a commitment to safety, it's plausible that OpenAI might publicly endorse this principle to enhance its reputation and show a proactive stance on AI safety issues. However, predicting the actions of a specific company involves many uncertainties, including internal decision-making processes, strategic considerations, and the influence of external pressures. Given these factors, while there's a reasonable chance OpenAI might commit to the principle, it's far from certain. Event (b): The Pandemic Agreement is not approved at the May 2024 World Health Assembly. The approval of the Pandemic Agreement at the World Health Assembly (WHA) depends on various factors, including the agreement's content, the level of international consensus, and the voting dynamics at the WHA. International agreements often face challenges in achieving unanimous approval due to differing national interests, concerns about sovereignty, and varying levels of satisfaction with the agreement's terms. Given the complexity of international negotiations and the diverse perspectives of WHA member states, there's a significant chance that the Pandemic Agreement might not be approved in its current form. However, predicting the outcome of such negotiations is inherently uncertain, as it depends on numerous variables, including last-minute changes to the agreement and political considerations. Combining the Probabilities: To estimate the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening. Given the uncertainties involved, let's assign a probability of 0.4 to Event (a) (OpenAI committing to the principle) and a probability of 0.6 to Event (b) (the Pandemic Agreement not being approved). The combined probability would then be 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24. Reasoning: As detailed above, the probability estimate involves assessing the likelihood of OpenAI committing to a safety principle and the Pandemic Agreement not being approved at the WHA. Both events are uncertain and depend on various factors, leading to a combined probability that reflects these uncertainties."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "4b6438d0-ccb0-4669-ab5e-0bc5ee38381d", "title": "Will either the Pandemic Agreement be approved at the May 2024 World Health Assembly or will OpenAI publicly commit to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle before July 1, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if either of the following occurs: (1) During the May 2024 World Health Assembly (WHA), the Pandemic Agreement is approved in a vote, according to reports from credible sources.

However, without specific recent developments indicating an imminent change, it's difficult to predict with certainty that the DOC will terminate its agreement with Verisign before the specified date. Given the complexity of such decisions and the interests involved, the likelihood of this event seems relatively low without additional context. For the second event, Joe Biden's intentions regarding the 2024 presidential election would be a significant factor.

The absence of an announcement not to run before July 15, 2024, is more likely given his previous statements, but in politics, decisions can change up until the last moment.

This section, also known as the Disqualification Clause, has been rarely invoked and is subject to significant legal and political hurdles. The process would likely involve substantial legal battles, including potential appeals to higher courts, which could extend beyond the specified date of July 15, 2024. - Given the political polarization and the legal complexities involved, predicting such an outcome with certainty is challenging. However, considering the rarity of such actions and the time frame provided, it seems unlikely that Trump would be officially removed or blocked from all state ballots by the specified date. 2. **Russian Control of Chasiv Yar:** - The situation in Ukraine, particularly concerning Russian control over specific territories, is highly fluid and subject to rapid changes due to ongoing military operations. - As of the last available information, Chasiv Yar has been a contested area, but without access to real-time data or the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map's current status, predicting the exact control status as of June 1, 2024, is speculative. - However, considering the pattern of territorial gains and losses, it's plausible that control could shift, but predicting this with certainty is challenging. Given these considerations, both conditions are subject to significant uncertainties.

(a) Donald Trump Jr. being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of my last update, there's no strong indication that Donald Trump Jr. is a leading candidate for the Republican nomination. The Republican field is typically crowded, and while Donald Trump Jr. has a significant following and could potentially run, the competition includes other prominent figures, some of whom have more political experience and broader support within the party.

(b) Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat: This outcome depends on the perception of Joe Biden versus a generic Democrat among respondents. Generally, a generic candidate might not evoke as strong reactions or as clear an image as a known figure like Joe Biden, which could influence respondents' choices. However, a 3% gain specifically due to the opponent being Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat is a specific scenario. It suggests a nuanced understanding of how respondents view Trump in relation to specific opponents, which can be influenced by numerous factors including policy, personal characteristics, and campaign dynamics. Given these considerations: For (a), without specific evidence suggesting Donald Trump Jr. is leading or likely to lead the Republican nomination process, the probability seems relatively low. For (b), while it's plausible that Trump could gain more support when facing a named opponent like Joe Biden compared to a generic Democrat due to various factors, a 3% gain is a specific threshold that may or may not be crossed.

This experience and the recognition he gained could be advantageous in another bid for the nomination. However, the Republican Party's landscape has evolved since 2016, with new figures emerging and some of the party's priorities shifting. Notably, the influence of former President Donald Trump remains strong within the party, which could impact Cruz's chances, especially if Trump decides to run again or endorses another candidate. As of the last update, while Ted Cruz has not announced a candidacy, he is among the speculative contenders. The field of potential candidates could include other prominent Republicans, some of whom might have stronger backing from the party establishment or more momentum among the base.

Previous Ratings: Looking at the ratings for both Season 1 and Season 2, we can see a general trend of high ratings. Season 1 had an average rating of about 8.8, with all episodes except one (E6) rated above 8.5. For Season 2, despite a bit more variability, the average rating so far (excluding E6, which is unknown) is around 8.38. Notably, two episodes in Season 2 have already been rated above 8.5 (E1, E2, and significantly higher for E4 at 9.6). 2. Variability in Ratings: There's some variability in ratings, especially in Season 2, where we see ratings as low as 7.6 (E5) and as high as 9.6 (E4). This suggests that the audience's reception can vary significantly from one episode to another. 3. Episode 7 Significance: Often, in series like 'House of the Dragon,' episode 7 can be a critical or pivotal episode, setting the stage for the season finale. Given the show's pattern, particularly in Season 1 where E7 received a 9.1 rating, there might be an anticipation that S2E7 could also receive a high rating, potentially above 8.5. 4. IMDB Rating Patterns: IMDB ratings can fluctuate over time due to various factors, including the number of votes and changes in viewer opinions. However, considering we're looking at the rating just two days after release, the initial reaction is likely to be positive given the show's overall popularity and the anticipation for pivotal episodes. Given these considerations, while there's always a chance for an episode to receive a lower rating due to unforeseen factors (such as deviations from source material, pacing issues, or simply not meeting the high expectations of viewers), the overall trend and anticipation around pivotal episodes suggest a likelihood of S2E7 being rated >8.5 on IMDB."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "62b9be2d-bb57-423e-95f1-0df0ddce3377", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by end of July 15 (78 more!)

For event (a), 'House of the Dragon' S2E7 being rated >8.5 on IMDB two days after release, we should consider the ratings of previous episodes and general trends in IMDB ratings. While specific data on previous episodes' ratings isn't provided, it's known that popular series like 'House of the Dragon' often receive high ratings, especially if the series has been maintaining a high standard of storytelling, production quality, and audience engagement. However, ratings can fluctuate based on episode content, plot development, and audience expectations. Without specific ratings data on previous episodes, it's challenging to make a precise prediction, but given the popularity and general positive reception of the series, a rating >8.5 is plausible but not guaranteed. Let's assume a moderate to high probability for this event. For event (b), the linked market getting at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, we need to consider the current number of traders, the rate of increase in traders, and the time frame until July 15. Unfortunately, the current number of traders and historical data on the rate of increase are not provided. The attractiveness of the market, market conditions, and external factors can influence the number of traders. Without specific data, it's difficult to estimate the probability accurately. However, achieving a specific number of traders within a short time frame can be challenging, especially if the market is niche or if there are external factors discouraging participation. Given these considerations, let's assign a probability to each event based on general assumptions: For event (a), considering the popularity of 'House of the Dragon' but without specific ratings data, let's assume a probability of 0.6 (or 60%) that it will achieve a rating >8.5 on IMDB. For event (b), without knowing the current number of traders or the growth rate, but considering the challenge of reaching a specific number within a short time frame, let's assume a probability of 0.4 (or 40%). The probability of either event (a) or (b) occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring (to avoid double counting), according to the principle of inclusion-exclusion. However, without information on the dependency or correlation between these events, we will simplify by assuming independence, which might not be entirely accurate but is the best approach given the data available. The probability of both independent events occurring is the product of their probabilities: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.

Current Polling Average: As of the question's creation on July 8, 2024, Trump's lead over Biden is 2.4 points. This value falls within the specified range, indicating a positive start. 2. Polling Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological differences among polls. However, significant shifts within a short period (in this case, a week) are relatively rare, especially when considering averages that tend to smooth out individual poll variations. 3. Trend Stability: The closer we are to the election, the more stable polling trends tend to become as more voters solidify their choices. Given that the question pertains to a date roughly 3.5 months before the election, there's still room for public opinion shifts, but drastic changes in a short span like a week are less common. 4. Margin of Error: Most polls have a margin of error ranging from 2 to 4 percentage points. This means that even if a poll shows a lead within the specified range, the actual lead could potentially be outside of it due to sampling error. However, since we're considering a polling average, which aggregates multiple polls, the margin of error is somewhat mitigated. Considering these factors, the current lead already falls within the specified range, and given the short timeframe (a week from the question's creation to its resolution), drastic changes are unlikely. However, the inherent volatility of polls and the margin of error associated with them introduce some uncertainty. Therefore, while acknowledging the potential for minor fluctuations, the probability that Trump's lead remains within the specified range seems relatively high, given the stability of averages and the short time frame in question."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "c16f7a5b-e632-4af4-bd01-3eae59410016", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Joe Biden have an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024, and (2) Trump's lead over Biden be less than or equal to 2 or greater than 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "(1) Joe Biden must appear in an in-person interview for at least 45 minutes before the end of July 2024.

Historical Polling Trends: Polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors, including political events, economic conditions, and public opinion shifts. However, without access to real-time data or specific trends leading up to July 2024, it's challenging to predict the exact margin with confidence. 2. Margin of Error in Polls: Polls, including those aggregated by 538, have margins of error. Typically, these margins can range from 2 to 4 percentage points, depending on the sample size and the poll's methodology. This inherent uncertainty makes precise predictions of poll outcomes difficult. 3. The Specific Range: The question asks for a lead greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4 points. This is a narrow range, and given the variability in polling data, predicting such a specific outcome involves a significant degree of uncertainty. 4. Political Events and External Factors: Between the creation of this question and its resolution date, numerous political events, debates, policy announcements, and possibly unforeseen circumstances (e.g., economic shifts, international events) could influence public opinion. These factors can cause swings in polling numbers, making it harder to predict the outcome with precision. Given these considerations, predicting a specific, narrow range for Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average involves a high degree of uncertainty. Without specific data on trends leading up to July 2024 or a method to accurately forecast future political events and public opinion shifts, any prediction must be cautious.

Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average: The first part of the question focuses on whether Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in the national polling average for the 2024 presidential election, as reported by 538, will be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024. This requires us to consider the polling trends and the potential stability or volatility of these numbers over time. 2. Chris Christie as the Republican nominee: The second part of the question concerns whether Chris Christie will be selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This involves evaluating Christie's chances within the Republican Party and the dynamics of the nomination process. Reasoning for Part 1: - Polling Trends and Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate based on various factors, including recent events, candidate actions, and changes in public opinion. A lead of greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4 points is a relatively narrow margin, suggesting a competitive race. Given the historical volatility of polling numbers, predicting such a specific margin months in advance is challenging. - Historical Context and Election Dynamics: The 2024 election dynamics, including the candidates' strategies and external factors like economic conditions and global events, will influence polling numbers. Historically, polling leads can change significantly over the course of an election year. Reasoning for Part 2: - Chris Christie's Standing in the Republican Party: Chris Christie, a former Governor of New Jersey, has been a figure in the Republican Party but has not been at the forefront of national politics in recent years. His chances of becoming the nominee depend on various factors, including his decision to run, his campaign strategy, and how he is perceived by Republican voters and delegates compared to other potential candidates. - Nomination Process Dynamics: The Republican nomination process involves primaries and caucuses across the country, culminating in the Republican National Convention. The outcome can be influenced by many factors, including the number of candidates, the primary schedule, and the preferences of party delegates. Overall Reasoning: Given the specificity of the polling margin required for the first condition and the current political landscape, predicting such a precise outcome is challenging. For the second condition, while Chris Christie has a history within the Republican Party, predicting his nomination involves significant uncertainty given the dynamics of the nomination process and the field of potential candidates. Probability: Considering the uncertainties and challenges in predicting both outcomes with precision, a relatively low probability seems appropriate for this question resolving as \"Yes\". However, given the nature of political forecasting, where unexpected events can significantly alter outcomes, assigning a probability of 0 would be overly confident in the impossibility of these events. Probability: 0.15 This probability reflects the difficulty in predicting the specific polling margin and the challenges Chris Christie faces in securing the Republican nomination, while also acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in political forecasting that could lead to unexpected outcomes."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.03809696588797295, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Competitive Landscape: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 presidential election could be quite crowded, including figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others. The presence of well-known and potentially well-funded candidates complicates Scott's path to the nomination. 3.

(a) Tim Scott being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of my last update in April 2023, Tim Scott is a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and has been mentioned among potential candidates for the Republican nomination. However, the field for the Republican nomination is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile figures potentially running, including Donald Trump, who has already announced his candidacy. The likelihood of Tim Scott securing the nomination depends on various factors, including his decision to run, his campaign's strength, the strategies of his competitors, and the preferences of the Republican base and delegates at the convention. Historically, securing the Republican nomination often requires significant national recognition, strong fundraising capabilities, and broad appeal within the party. Given these considerations and without more recent data on Scott's intentions or performance in primary polls, it's challenging to assign a high probability to him becoming the nominee. Let's tentatively assign a probability of 0.05 (5%) to this event, recognizing that this is a speculative estimate and actual probabilities could vary based on future developments. (b) Joe Biden having a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Donald Trump according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for July 19, 2024: This part of the question involves predicting the future state of the 2024 presidential election based on FiveThirtyEight's forecasting model. As of my last update, the election is over a year away, and numerous factors can influence the forecast, including the state of the economy, major policy developments, the candidates' health, and unforeseen events. Historically, FiveThirtyEight's forecasts have been relatively accurate, but they are subject to change significantly as new information becomes available. Given the distance to the election and the inherent uncertainties, predicting the exact state of the forecast in July 2024 is challenging. However, we can consider some general trends. Incumbent presidents often have an advantage in elections, but this advantage can be eroded by economic downturns, unpopular policies, or personal scandals. The Democratic Party's performance and the public's perception of Biden's presidency will play significant roles in determining his chances. Without current polling data or specific insights into future events, let's cautiously estimate the probability that Biden will be forecasted as more likely to win than Trump in July 2024. Given the uncertainties and the historical advantages of incumbency, let's assign a probability of 0.55 (55%) to this event, acknowledging that this is a speculative estimate and subject to significant change. Combining the Probabilities: To find the combined probability of either event happening, we add the probabilities of each event occurring minus the probability of both events occurring together (to avoid double-counting), but since these events are essentially mutually exclusive (Tim Scott becoming the nominee would likely change the dynamics of the election forecast significantly), we can simplify our calculation to just adding the probabilities: 0.05 (Tim Scott being the nominee) + 0.55 (Biden being forecasted to win) = 0.60. Reasoning: The probability is based on speculative estimates given the current distance from the election and lack of specific data on recent developments. It combines a low estimated probability of Tim Scott becoming the Republican nominee with a cautiously optimistic estimate of Joe Biden's chances according to future FiveThirtyEight forecasts."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.009023990372987109, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.003007996790995703, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.13921151159742626, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The presence of these competitors, especially Trump, significantly complicates Scott's path to the nomination. 3. Historical Context: Historically, the Republican Party has shown a tendency to nominate candidates who have previously held high office or have run in previous presidential primaries. While there are exceptions, this trend suggests that Scott, lacking a previous presidential run or a high-profile executive position, might face an uphill battle. 4. Fundraising and Support: The ability to raise funds and garner support from key figures within the party is crucial.

These factors could include new polls, changes in the overall political climate, and updates to the model itself. However, without specific information on upcoming events or polls that could significantly impact Harris's chances, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether her odds will increase. That being said, considering the relatively short timeframe (one week) and the absence of any mentioned significant events (like debates, major policy announcements, or scandals involving the opposition), it's reasonable to assume a degree of stability in the polling averages and, by extension, in the model's predictions. However, models like Nate Silver's are designed to incorporate new data as it becomes available, and even minor fluctuations in support can lead to changes in the calculated probabilities of winning. Given these considerations, the likelihood of Harris's odds increasing by any amount, no matter how small, is inherently higher than the likelihood of her odds remaining perfectly stable or decreasing, simply because there are more ways for her odds to increase (e.g., a favorable poll, a slight decline in her opponent's support) than for them to remain exactly the same or decrease. However, the specific threshold of >46.6% introduces a more precise condition that needs to be met, making the outcome less about general trends and more about whether the model's adjustments over the week are sufficient to push her odds above this specific level. Without detailed insight into the model's current inputs and how they might change, predicting this with high confidence is challenging. Given the nature of polling and election models, which are subject to a variety of influences and uncertainties, and considering the specific condition that needs to be met (>46.6%), a moderate approach seems most appropriate.

Despite losing the 2020 election, he received more than 74 million votes, the second-highest total ever for a presidential candidate at the time. His popularity within a substantial segment of the Republican base is undeniable. 2. Current Political Climate: The political landscape is highly polarized, with Trump remaining a central figure. His influence over the Republican Party and its base is considerable, as evidenced by the 'Stop the Steal' movement and the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which underscored the depth of his supporters' loyalty. 3. Potential Opponents: While several other Republicans have been mentioned as potential candidates for the 2024 nomination, including Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley, none have yet demonstrated the same level of grassroots support or national recognition as Trump. 4. Nomination Process: The Republican National Convention's delegate selection process is key to winning the nomination. Trump has shown a keen ability to navigate and dominate this process in the past, leveraging his popularity and organizational skills to secure delegates. 5. Legal and Health Considerations: As of the last update, there are ongoing investigations and legal challenges involving Trump. However, unless these result in significant legal repercussions that directly impact his eligibility or ability to campaign, they are unlikely to deter his core supporters. Health considerations for a candidate of Trump's age are also relevant but have not been a major concern based on publicly available information.

Current Polling Status: As of the question's creation on July 8, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points. This value falls within the specified range, suggesting that, as of the current moment, the condition is met. 2. Polling Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including changes in public opinion, new campaign strategies, and external events (e.g., economic shifts, international crises). However, significant shifts within a short period (in this case, 7 days from July 8 to July 15) are relatively uncommon, especially in averages like 538's, which are designed to smooth out individual poll variations. 3. Trend Stability: If the trend from the last available data point to July 8 has been relatively stable or slightly increasing in Trump's favor, it might be reasonable to expect this stability to continue, assuming no major event significantly impacts public opinion. 4. Margin of Error and Statistical Variance: Even with a stable trend, there's always a margin of error in polling data. Averages like 538's reduce this error but don't eliminate it. Therefore, small fluctuations around the current value are possible. Given these considerations and without access to real-time data or specific trends beyond July 8, 2024, we lean on the general stability of polling averages over short periods and the current lead as of July 8. However, predicting polling outcomes involves inherent uncertainty, especially with the dynamic nature of political campaigns.

They returned briefly in the late 1990s but have not participated since 1998.

Return to the Contest: If Luxembourg decides to return to the contest in 2024, their qualification chances could be influenced by the excitement and novelty of their return, potentially garnering more attention and votes from both the public and juries. 3. Song and Artist Quality: A crucial factor in qualifying for the Grand Final is the quality and appeal of the song and artist. Without knowing who will represent Luxembourg or the song they will perform, it's challenging to assess their chances accurately. However, if they select a strong entry that resonates with the audience and juries, their chances of qualifying would significantly increase. 4. Competition: The level of competition in the semi-finals also plays a significant role. Depending on which countries and songs Luxembourg is up against, their chances of standing out and securing a spot in the Grand Final could vary. 5. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by various factors, including geographical location, cultural connections, and diaspora voting. Luxembourg, being a Western European country, might benefit from some of these voting patterns, but without recent participation, their current alliances and voting support are uncertain.

Slovenia has been a regular participant in the Eurovision Song Contest. For Slovenia to qualify for the Grand Final, they would need to perform well in their assigned Semi-final, securing a spot among the top 10 countries in that Semi-final. Slovenia's past performances have been mixed, but they have shown the potential to qualify for the Grand Final. Their qualification would largely depend on the quality of their entry, the competition in their Semi-final, and the voting dynamics. Luxembourg has not participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since 1993. For Luxembourg to fail to qualify for the Grand Final, they would either need to not participate in the contest at all or, if they do participate, fail to secure a top 10 spot in their assigned Semi-final. Given Luxembourg's long absence from the contest, it's uncertain whether they will return for the 2024 edition. If they do return, their chances of qualification would be uncertain, depending on their entry's quality and the competition. Given these considerations: Slovenia's qualification is uncertain but plausible if they present a strong entry. Luxembourg's participation is uncertain, and if they do participate, their qualification is also uncertain. However, the question requires both Slovenia to qualify and Luxembourg to not qualify (or not participate). Without specific information on the entries or confirmation of Luxembourg's participation, we must consider the probabilities of these independent events. Assuming a neutral stance on the quality of potential entries and acknowledging the uncertainty around Luxembourg's participation: The probability of Slovenia qualifying could be generously estimated at around 0.5, given their mixed past performances. The probability of Luxembourg not qualifying (including the scenario where they do not participate) could be estimated higher, around 0.7, considering their long absence and the uncertainty around their return. To find the combined probability of both independent events happening, we multiply their probabilities: 0.5 (Slovenia qualifying) * 0.7 (Luxembourg not qualifying) = 0.35.

Switzerland, one of the founding members of Eurovision, has won the contest twice (1956 and 1988) but has seen a decline in success in recent decades, with some qualifications to the final but also several non-qualifications. The qualification for the Grand Final is based on a combination of jury and public voting in the semi-finals. The top 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final. This system makes it crucial for countries to appeal to both the professional juries and the public to secure a spot. In recent years, both Norway and Switzerland have shown potential. Norway has qualified for the final several times since 2009, showing a relatively consistent performance. Switzerland has had a resurgence in success, qualifying for the final in 2019 and 2021, which indicates an improving trend. A significant factor in Eurovision success is the quality and appeal of the song and performance. Without knowing the specific entries for 2024, it's challenging to predict how they will be received. However, both countries have shown the ability to select competitive entries in the past. Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical and cultural factors. Norway often benefits from voting patterns within the Nordic and Western European countries. Switzerland, being a country with multiple languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh), can sometimes appeal to a broader range of voters but may also struggle to find a consistent voting base. Considering these factors, while there's no guarantee of qualification for either country, their past successes and recent trends suggest a reasonable likelihood of at least one of them qualifying for the Grand Final.

However, historically, polling averages can fluctuate but tend to stabilize as the election approaches, with significant changes often being the result of major events or revelations. Polling Margin: A lead of greater than 2 but less than or equal to 4 points suggests a relatively tight race but with a noticeable advantage for Trump. This margin is plausible in a closely contested election but predicting it with precision requires up-to-date data on voter sentiment, campaign dynamics, and external factors influencing the election.

This is a broad estimate based on the understanding that polling averages can fluctuate and that a 2-4 point lead is a reasonable margin in a tight race. 2. 538 Projecting Biden as not the favorite on July 19, 2024: Projection Methodology: FiveThirtyEight's election forecast incorporates a wide range of data, including polling averages, economic indicators, and historical trends. Their methodology is sophisticated and aims to provide a probabilistic outlook on the election outcome. Factors Influencing Projections: The projection for July 19, 2024, would take into account the latest polling data (including the July 15 data mentioned in part 1), economic indicators, and any significant events up to that point. If Trump maintains a lead in the polls and other indicators favor him, it's plausible that 538's model could project him as the favorite. Probability Estimate for Part 2: Given that part 1's condition (Trump's lead) could significantly influence 538's projection, the probability of Biden not being the favorite would correlate with the probability of Trump maintaining a lead and other factors aligning in his favor. Assuming the conditions for part 1 are met, the probability of 538 projecting Biden as not the favorite could be somewhat higher, potentially in the range of 40-50%, considering the model would reflect recent polling trends and other relevant data. Combining the Probabilities: To estimate the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening. Using the rough estimates provided: Probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024: 20-30% Probability of 538 projecting Biden as not the favorite on July 19, 2024, given Trump's lead: 40-50% Taking the midpoint of each range for simplicity (25% and 45%, respectively), the combined probability would be approximately 0.25 * 0.45 = 0.1125. Reasoning: The combined probability estimate is based on rough estimates for each part of the question, considering historical trends, the plausible range of polling margins, and how these might influence 538's election forecast. The actual probability could vary significantly based on current events, polling data, and other factors not available at the time of this analysis."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "a0ac4efb-bb07-42ca-a01f-5f3f1badd415", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Biden is projected as the favorite by 538 on July 19, 2024, (b) Trump's lead over Biden is between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "(a) Biden is projected as the favorite by 538 on July 19, 2024: This will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if Joe Biden has a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Donald Trump according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for the day of July 19, 2024.

Given the information available up to my last update in April 2023, I will provide a reasoned estimate, but please note that actual probabilities may have shifted due to events occurring after my last update. Event (a): Biden is projected as the favorite by 538 on July 19, 2024. The political landscape in the United States has been highly polarized, with both President Biden and former President Trump having dedicated bases of support. Polls this far out from the election have not been highly predictive of the outcome, but they can give us a snapshot of the current sentiment. Biden's approval ratings and head-to-head matchups against Trump have shown fluctuations, but as of early 2023, these metrics were not strongly in favor of either candidate consistently across all polls. FiveThirtyEight's election forecast incorporates a wide range of data, including polling averages, economic indicators, and historical trends. Their model tends to favor candidates who are performing well in the polls and who have strong economic indicators. Given these considerations, predicting whether Biden will be the favorite in July 2024 is challenging without current data. However, considering the general trend of close competition between the two, it's plausible that Biden could be favored, especially if the economy improves or if Trump faces significant challenges in his campaign. Event (b): Trump's lead over Biden is between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average. The margin between Trump and Biden in national polls has historically been tight, often within a few percentage points. A lead of 2 to 4 points for Trump is within the realm of possibility, especially if he experiences a surge in support or if Biden faces challenges. Polling averages can fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including significant events, campaign strategies, and changes in public opinion. A 2 to 4 point lead could easily shift within a short period due to these factors. FiveThirtyEight's polling averages are adjusted for pollster quality, sample size, and other factors to provide a more accurate snapshot of the race. This methodology aims to reduce the impact of outlier polls and provide a clearer picture of the race. Considering these points, a Trump lead of 2 to 4 points is plausible but highly dependent on the specific circumstances leading up to July 15, 2024. Given the historical closeness of the race and the potential for shifts in public opinion, it's difficult to confidently predict either outcome. However, considering the factors mentioned, it's reasonable to believe that there's a possibility for either event to occur, especially given the volatility in polling and the long time frame before the election."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0103815521255185, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0034605173751728335, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1457425380493749, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For (a), as of my last update, there has been no clear indication from Joe Biden or his campaign that he intends to step down or not accept the Democratic nomination. While there have been numerous speculations and discussions about his age and potential for not seeking re-election, without a definitive statement from Biden himself, it's challenging to predict with certainty. However, given the lack of such statements and considering the usual political trajectory, where incumbents often seek re-election, it seems less likely that he would make such an announcement. For (b), Will Hurd has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, but the field is crowded, and the outcome is highly uncertain. The Republican nomination process involves numerous candidates, and the selection is made by delegates at the Republican National Convention. Given the competitive nature of the primary process and the number of candidates involved, predicting the outcome with high confidence is challenging. However, considering the broad field of candidates and the uncertainty inherent in political races, it's reasonable to consider that any single candidate, including Will Hurd, faces significant competition and uncertainty in securing the nomination. Combining these considerations, the likelihood of both events occurring (Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination and Will Hurd not being the Republican nominee) involves a level of uncertainty, particularly given the unpredictability of political events and announcements.

This suggests a specific negative perception or vulnerability associated with Joe Biden that might not be as pronounced or present with a generic Democrat. Given this context, it's plausible that among Manifold respondents, Donald Trump could gain a higher percentage of votes when facing Joe Biden compared to facing a generic Democrat. This is because the specific criticisms or negative perceptions associated with Joe Biden could lead some respondents who might otherwise vote for a Democrat to choose Donald Trump or abstain/choose 'Someone else,' thereby increasing Trump's share of the vote in the Biden matchup. However, the key question is whether this difference will be at least 3%. A 3% difference is significant and suggests a substantial shift in voter preference based solely on the Democratic candidate being Joe Biden rather than a generic figure.

Part 1: At least 5 named Dem House Members or US Senators pressure Biden to drop out before July 20th. The information provided indicates there's already some level of discontent among Democrats with two safe-seat members publicly urging Biden out and two of the most endangered Democrats expressing skepticism about Biden\u2019s chances in November. Additionally, there are reports of multiple drafts of letters circulating among House Democrats, with at least one calling on Biden to end his campaign. This suggests a tangible level of dissatisfaction within the party regarding Biden's candidacy. However, the question requires that at least five named Democratic Party US House Members/US Senators work together to ask Joe Biden to consider ending his campaign before July 20th. While there's evidence of discontent, it's not clear if this will coalesce into a formal, public call for Biden to drop out by the specified deadline. Given the existing signs of discontent and the relatively short timeframe for further developments, let's estimate the probability of this event occurring as somewhat likely but not certain, reflecting the challenges in coordinating such a public stance among elected officials. Part 2: Trump gains less than 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat. This part of the question involves a comparison between two hypothetical polls on Manifold, one pitting Trump against Biden and the other against a generic Democrat. The question resolves YES if Trump's percentage of votes in the poll against Biden is less than or equal to that in the poll against a generic Democrat by less than 3%. Without specific data from the polls, it's difficult to make a precise estimate. However, we can reason about this generally. Trump's performance against a generic Democrat might be expected to be worse than against Biden specifically, due to the potential for a generic Democrat to be perceived more favorably or neutrally than a known candidate with established positives and negatives like Biden. However, the 3% margin is relatively narrow, suggesting that the difference in Trump's performance between the two scenarios might not be significantly large. Given the lack of specific poll data and considering the narrow margin required for the YES condition, let's treat this as somewhat uncertain but leaning towards a possibility, acknowledging the potential for tight margins in such hypothetical matchups. Combining the Parts: To estimate the probability that both events occur, we need to consider the combined likelihood of two independent events happening. This is done by multiplying the probabilities of each event. Given the analysis: Part 1 seems somewhat likely but not certain; let's assign a rough estimate of 0.6. Part 2 is uncertain but leaning towards a possibility; let's assign a rough estimate of 0.55. The combined probability would then be 0.6 * 0.55 = 0.33."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "1a679624-8743-4415-8e59-b8f935aa5605", "title": "Will either Trump gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, or a group of at least 5 named Dem House Members or US Senators pressure Biden to drop out before July 20th?", "body": "(1) Facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, will Trump gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents? \n- There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6.

Understanding Fidesz-KDNP: Fidesz-KDNP is a political alliance in Hungary, with Fidesz being the dominant party. This alliance has maintained a strong hold on Hungarian politics for several years, with Viktor Orb\u00e1n as the Prime Minister. The KDNP (Christian Democratic People's Party) is a smaller party that has been in an electoral alliance with Fidesz since 2006. 2. European Parliament Elections: The European Parliament (EP) elections are crucial for determining the political composition of the European Union's legislative body. Each member state is allocated a certain number of seats based on its population. In these elections, national parties or alliances compete, but often they are also affiliated with European-level political groups. 3. Fidesz-KDNP's Current Position: Historically, Fidesz-KDNP has been very successful in both national and European Parliament elections. However, its relationship with the European Union has been strained due to various issues, including rule of law concerns and migration policies. Despite these tensions, the alliance has maintained significant support within Hungary. 4. Opposition in Hungary: The opposition to Fidesz-KDNP in Hungary is fragmented, consisting of several parties across the political spectrum. While there have been attempts to unify the opposition, Fidesz-KDNP's strong organizational base and the current electoral system in Hungary have made it challenging for the opposition to pose a significant threat. 5. Public Opinion and Polls: As of my last update, public opinion polls in Hungary have shown that Fidesz-KDNP maintains a lead over opposition parties. However, the dynamics of public opinion can change, influenced by various factors including economic conditions, government policies, and international events. 6. EU Parliament Election Dynamics: The European Parliament elections might see different dynamics compared to national elections, as voters may prioritize different issues. However, Fidesz-KDNP has historically performed well in these elections, leveraging its strong national support base. Considering these factors, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in predicting future election outcomes, it seems likely that Fidesz-KDNP will maintain its plurality of Hungarian seats in the European Parliament.

Historically, Belgium has had mixed success in Eurovision. While they have won the contest once (in 1986) and have had some top 10 finishes, they have also failed to qualify for the Grand Final several times, especially in the 2000s and early 2010s. However, in recent years, Belgium has shown improvement, qualifying for the Grand Final more consistently and even achieving a top 10 finish in 2015. Music trends and voting patterns play a significant role in Eurovision. The contest has evolved over the years, with different genres and performance styles gaining popularity. Belgium's entries have varied, but they have often opted for contemporary styles that appeal to a broad audience. The voting system, which combines jury and public votes, can also influence outcomes. Political voting and bloc voting are phenomena that exist, though the EBU has implemented measures to minimize their impact. For 2024, without knowing the specific entry Belgium will present, it's challenging to assess its potential for success directly. However, considering Belgium's recent improvements and assuming they will continue to invest in selecting a competitive entry, there's a reasonable basis for optimism. Another factor is the competition itself. The quality and appeal of entries from other countries can significantly affect any single country's chances.

However, we can assume that the polling average will likely be influenced by various factors, including campaign events, debates, and external factors like economic conditions. For event (b), we need to consider the market capitalization of Nvidia and Apple. As of the question's creation date, Nvidia's market capitalization is likely to be lower than Apple's, given Apple's historical market dominance. However, the market capitalization of both companies can fluctuate rapidly due to various market and economic factors. Given the uncertainty and volatility of both events, it's challenging to assign a high probability to either event occurring. However, we can consider the possibility of either event occurring and assign a probability accordingly."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.015328803705401906, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.005109601235133969, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17521552924891493, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) The Los Angeles Clippers winning the 2024 NBA Finals: The Clippers have a strong roster with players like Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. However, the NBA is highly competitive, with several teams having the potential to win the championship, including the Clippers. The likelihood of the Clippers winning depends on various factors such as team dynamics, injuries, and playoff matchups.

While upsets can happen, the Pacers would need significant improvements or a remarkable playoff run to win the championship. Considering both components: The probability of the Clippers winning the NBA Finals can be considered moderate given their talent but also the competitive nature of the league. The probability of the Pacers not winning the NBA Finals is relatively high, given the current team standings and historical performance. To estimate a combined probability for both events happening (Clippers winning and Pacers not winning), we need to consider that these events are not entirely independent since they are both influenced by the overall competitive landscape of the NBA. However, for simplicity, we can treat them as if they were independent to get a rough estimate. Assuming the Clippers have a moderate chance of winning the NBA Finals (let's say around 15% given the competitive field) and the Pacers have a very low chance of winning the NBA Finals (let's say around 2% given their current standing), the probability of the Pacers not winning would be 98%.

Any changes in the coaching staff or significant improvements in team dynamics could positively impact their chances. The NBA is highly competitive, with several teams that are currently stronger on paper, such as the Boston Celtics, Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets, and others.

Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024: The relationship between Israel and Iran is tense, with a history of covert operations and military strikes. Israel has carried out attacks within Iran in the past, targeting nuclear facilities and personnel. Given the ongoing tensions and Israel's past actions, there is a plausible likelihood of such an event occurring. However, predicting military actions with certainty is challenging due to the complex and often secretive nature of such operations. Therefore, while there is a possibility, it's not extremely high due to the specific timeframe (before May 1, 2024) and the geopolitical complexities involved. 2. The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) not being higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024: Volatility indices like the VXVCLS can fluctuate significantly based on market conditions, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment. Predicting the exact level of volatility indices is inherently difficult, but we can consider general market trends and economic conditions. If the global economic situation stabilizes or improves, and there are no major shocks (e.g., significant geopolitical events, unexpected economic downturns), volatility might decrease or remain stable. However, given the interconnectedness of global markets and the potential for unforeseen events, predicting this with certainty is challenging.

Historical Precedent: It's not uncommon for top tennis players to compete in and win multiple events at the Olympics. For instance, the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, have both won multiple gold medals in singles and doubles. Given the right level of skill and endurance, winning more than one medal is achievable. 2. Competition Format: Tennis at the Olympics typically includes singles and doubles events for both men and women, as well as a mixed doubles event. This provides multiple avenues for athletes to win medals. An athlete with strong overall skills could potentially compete in singles and either same-sex or mixed doubles, increasing their chances of winning more than one medal. 3. Athlete Skill and Endurance: The ability to win more than one medal depends heavily on the athlete's skill level, physical condition, and mental endurance. Top-ranked players who are accustomed to playing multiple matches in quick succession (as in Grand Slam tournaments) might have an advantage. 4. Partnership Dynamics: In doubles events, the success of an athlete is also dependent on their partner's skills and their teamwork. An athlete might be highly skilled individually but could struggle if their doubles partner is not equally skilled or if they do not work well together. 5. Competition Level: The Olympics attract the best athletes from around the world, making the competition extremely tough. Even the most skilled athletes can have off days or face opponents who have a particular advantage over them. Considering these factors, it's reasonable to assume that there will be athletes capable of winning more than one medal, especially given the opportunity to compete in both singles and doubles events. However, predicting this with certainty is challenging due to the variables involved, such as athlete form, competition level, and potential for injury or upset.

Current Polling Average: As of the question's creation on July 9, 2024, Trump's lead over Biden is 2.4 points. This value falls within the specified range, indicating a positive start. 2. Polling Volatility: Poll numbers can fluctuate due to various factors, including new campaign strategies, public debates, economic changes, and external events. However, significant shifts within a short period (in this case, six days from July 9 to July 15) are less common, especially in a well-established race like the 2024 presidential election. 3. Trend Stability: The closer the election, the more stable polling averages tend to become as voters solidify their choices. However, July 2024 is still several months before the actual election, meaning there's potential for movement in the polls. 4. Margin of Error: Most polls have a margin of error, typically around 3-4 percentage points. This means that even if a poll shows a lead within our target range, the actual lead could be outside of it due to the margin of error. However, 538's polling average aggregates multiple polls, which tends to reduce the overall margin of error. 5. External Factors: Events between July 9 and July 15 could impact the polls. Positive news or successful campaign strategies for either candidate could shift the numbers. However, predicting such events and their impact is challenging. Considering these factors, the current lead of 2.4 points is already within the target range, suggesting a favorable starting point. However, given the potential for volatility and the inherent uncertainties in polling, there's always a chance the numbers could shift outside this range. The aggregated nature of 538's polling average and the relatively short timeframe suggest that drastic changes are less likely, but not impossible.

Current Polling Trends: As of the question's creation in June 2023, the polling data for the 2024 presidential election was subject to a high degree of variability and uncertainty. Polls this far out from an election are generally less predictive of the final outcome. 2. Historical Context: Polling averages can fluctuate significantly over the course of an election year due to various factors, including major political events, debates, candidate gaffes, and external factors like economic changes or international crises. 3. Margin of Error: Polling averages, such as those provided by 538, come with margins of error. A lead of 3 to 4 points is relatively narrow and could easily fall within the margin of error of many polls, making it difficult to predict with certainty. 4. Time Frame: The question is asking about a very specific snapshot in time (July 15, 2024), which is still over a year away from the question's creation date. Predicting polling numbers with such precision, especially given the dynamic nature of election campaigns, is challenging. 5. Election Dynamics: The dynamics of the election, including the candidates' campaigns, public opinion shifts, and unforeseen events, can significantly impact polling numbers. Trump and Biden's performance in debates, their campaign strategies, and their ability to respond to or capitalize on unforeseen events will influence their standings in the polls. Given these considerations, predicting a specific lead within a narrow range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points) for Trump over Biden on a specific date over a year in advance is highly speculative. The factors influencing election polls are too numerous and unpredictable to make such a precise forecast with a high degree of confidence. Therefore, the probability that Trump's lead over Biden will be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, should be considered relatively low due to the inherent uncertainties and the long timeframe involved."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "ca232dee-e805-44d6-b415-a231309386aa", "title": "Will Glenn Youngkin be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election and will Trump's lead over Biden be either less than or equal to 3 or greater than 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

First, let's consider Ted Cruz's chances. As of my last update, while Ted Cruz is a prominent figure within the Republican Party, the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election is not yet officially determined. However, given the structure of the question, we must consider the likelihood of Cruz being selected at the Republican National Convention. Historically, the Republican Party has often nominated candidates who either lead in the primaries or have significant establishment backing. While Cruz has a strong base of support, predicting his nomination would require more up-to-date information on the current political landscape, primary results, and the dynamics within the Republican Party. Without current polling data or primary results, it's challenging to provide a precise probability, but given the competitive nature of the primaries, we can infer that his nomination, while possible, is not assured. Second, regarding Kamala Harris's odds according to Nate Silver's model, predicting short-term movements in electoral odds can be highly speculative. These models incorporate a wide range of data, including polls, economic indicators, and historical trends. A movement in Harris's odds could be influenced by numerous factors, including but not limited to new polling data, significant political events, or changes in the candidates' campaigns. As of my last update, without access to real-time data or the specifics of Nate Silver's model, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether Harris's odds will increase above the specified threshold by the given date. Given these considerations, we're essentially estimating the probability of two relatively independent events, each with its own set of uncertainties. For Ted Cruz's nomination, we lack specific current data to make a strong prediction. For Kamala Harris's odds, predicting a specific increase in a short timeframe is inherently challenging due to the dynamic nature of electoral campaigns and the multitude of factors influencing them. Therefore, without more current and specific information, we must approach this estimation with caution. Given the speculative nature of both components of the question, a moderate approach seems most prudent, acknowledging the possibilities without overstating their likelihoods."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3822353935782192, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

As of my last update in 2023, the political environment in France has been characterized by a degree of instability and fragmentation, with multiple political parties and coalitions vying for power. The New Popular Front and Together coalitions represent significant political forces, but the French political system is known for its complexity and the potential for shifts in party alliances and public opinion. Several factors could influence the likelihood of a change in the governing coalition: 1. Legislative Elections and Political Shifts: Any legislative elections or significant political events before July 2024 could alter the balance of power among the political parties in France. If these events favor parties outside of the New Popular Front or Together coalitions, there's a higher chance of a Prime Minister from a different coalition. 2. Government Stability: The stability of the current government is crucial. If the current government faces significant challenges, such as no-confidence votes, internal party disputes, or major policy failures, this could lead to a change in leadership or the formation of a new coalition. 3. Public Opinion and Economic Factors: Shifts in public opinion, influenced by economic conditions, social issues, or other factors, could impact the political landscape. A significant swing in public support away from the current governing parties could increase the likelihood of a different coalition taking power. 4. Coalition Dynamics: The dynamics within and between the New Popular Front and Together coalitions, including any potential for splits or mergers, could also affect the outcome. Given these considerations, predicting the exact outcome is challenging due to the inherent uncertainties in political forecasting. However, considering the potential for shifts in the political landscape and the known dynamics of French politics, we can attempt to estimate a probability. Probability: 0.35 This estimate reflects the potential for political shifts and realignments but also acknowledges the current significance of the New Popular Front and Together coalitions in French politics. It suggests that while there is a possibility of the Prime Minister belonging to a different coalition by July 30, 2024, it is slightly less likely than the continuation of the current political configuration."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "dac748d8-534d-4b2d-b76d-c915a4ddf186", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The ID political group holds the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections, and (b) The Prime Minister of France belongs to New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as **Yes** if the ID political group holds the most seats after the 2024 European Parliament elections.

Event (a) refers to the Prime Minister of France belonging to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024. As of my last update, the political landscape in France is dominated by these two coalitions, with the current president, Emmanuel Macron, being a key figure in the Together coalition. However, French politics can be volatile, and there are opposition forces from both the left (New Popular Front) and the right (notably the National Rally, which is associated with the ID group in the European Parliament). Given the unpredictability of political shifts and the time frame before the resolution date, there is a possibility, albeit not a strong one, of a change in the coalition in power. Event (b) concerns the ID political group holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections. The ID group, primarily composed of nationalist and right-wing populist parties, has seen a rise in popularity in various European countries. However, as of the last elections, the ID group was not the largest in the European Parliament, and the European political landscape is highly fragmented. The outcome of the elections depends on numerous factors, including the performance of other political groups and voter turnout. While there is a possibility of the ID group gaining more seats, predicting they will hold the most seats is speculative without concrete polling data indicating a significant surge in support across member states. Given these considerations, estimating the probability of either event occurring requires an assessment of political trends in France and across Europe. Both scenarios are plausible but not highly probable based on current information. The likelihood of a significant shift in the French government's coalition or the ID group becoming the largest in the European Parliament would depend on various factors, including public opinion shifts, economic conditions, and the political strategies of the involved parties. Without specific polling data or recent political developments indicating a strong likelihood of either event, we must rely on general trends and the inherent unpredictability of political outcomes."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15636298703299828, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, they qualified in 2019 and 2021, showing a recent uptick in performance. 2. Competition Format: The Eurovision semi-finals feature a significant number of countries vying for a limited number of spots in the final. The competition is fierce, and qualification can depend on a variety of factors including song quality, performance, and voting patterns. 3. Song and Artist Selection: The quality of the song and the performing artist can greatly influence a country's chances. Switzerland has used a mix of internal selections and national finals to choose their entries. The success of their selection method can vary, but they have shown a willingness to experiment and adapt. 4. Voting Dynamics: Eurovision voting can be influenced by a variety of factors including cultural and geographical biases. Switzerland, being a country with multiple languages and cultural influences, might benefit from a broad appeal but lacks a large diaspora or a strong voting bloc compared to some other countries. Given these considerations, while Switzerland has shown recent improvement in qualifying for the final, the competition is highly unpredictable, and many factors can influence the outcome.
