Current World Record and Olympic Record: The current world record in the men's 100m dash is 9.48 seconds, held by Usain Bolt since 2009. The Olympic record, also set by Usain Bolt, is 9.63 seconds. Given that world-class athletes often aim to break records, there is a potential for athletes to target the Olympic record. 2. Recent Performances and Trends: In recent years, there hasn't been a significant improvement in the 100m dash times. Since Usain Bolt's retirement, no athlete has come close to breaking his world record. This could indicate a plateau in performance improvements. 3. Athlete Form and Competition: The outcome of the event would heavily depend on the form of the top athletes participating in the 2024 Olympics. If top sprinters are in their prime and have been performing well in the lead-up events, there could be a higher chance of the record being broken. 4. Advancements in Training and Technology: Improvements in training methods, sports science, and equipment technology can contribute to athletes achieving faster times. However, these advancements are gradual and may not necessarily lead to record-breaking performances in a specific event. 5. Paris Olympic Track Conditions: The conditions of the track in Paris, including factors like altitude, wind, and track surface, could influence the performances. A favorable environment might encourage faster times. Given these considerations, while it's possible for the Olympic record to be broken, the current trend suggests that a significant improvement in the 100m dash time to break the Olympic record might be challenging. Therefore, based on recent performances and the general stability of records in this event, the likelihood of the men's 100m dash winning time breaking the Olympic record of 9.63s seems relatively low but not impossible."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "e28ece30-4cfa-40c8-a996-8514852b6e3b", "title": "At the Paris Summer Olympics in 2024, will the men's 100m dash winning time break 9.70s?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if any athlete runs the Men's 100M race at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics in less than 9.70s, according to results posted by the [International Olympic Committee](https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/olympic-results) or credible sources.

While this record has stood for over a decade, it indicates that times under 9.70s are achievable by top athletes. 2. Recent Performances: In recent years, several athletes have run under 9.70s. For example, in 2021, Trayvon Bromell ran a 9.69s, and in 2022, Fred Kerley achieved a 9.69s as well. These performances suggest that the current generation of sprinters is capable of breaking the 9.70s barrier. 3. Athlete Development and Training: Advances in training methods, sports science, and technology could lead to improvements in sprinting times. Athletes and their coaches continually seek ways to optimize performance, which might result in faster times. 4. Competition Environment: The Olympics provide a high-stakes environment that can push athletes to achieve their best performances. The combination of intense competition, high-level training, and the psychological boost from competing on the world stage can lead to record-breaking performances. 5.

Firstly, the relationship between Iran and Israel is highly contentious, with both countries engaging in a proxy conflict for years, particularly in Syria and Lebanon. Iran's support for militant groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, which are sworn enemies of Israel, has been a significant point of contention. Israel has conducted numerous airstrikes against Iranian targets in Syria and has been accused of assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists and engaging in cyberattacks against Iranian facilities. Given this context, it's plausible that Iran might seek to retaliate or escalate its actions against Israel. However, the likelihood of such an attack being deadly and occurring within Israel's borders before a specific date is harder to assess. The timing and nature of such attacks are often unpredictable and subject to a variety of factors, including international pressure, internal political considerations, and strategic calculations. Furthermore, the fact that the question specifies the attack must be attributed to Iran and result in the death of at least five individuals adds specificity that narrows the scope of what constitutes a positive resolution. Attribution can sometimes be complex, given the use of proxies and the potential for false flag operations.

Current Market Conditions: As of my last update in April 2023, Nvidia, like many tech stocks, has experienced significant volatility due to broader market conditions, including inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions. These factors can rapidly impact investor sentiment and stock prices. 2. Company Performance: Nvidia's financial performance and future outlook play a crucial role. The company has been a leader in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market and has diversified into high-growth areas such as data center solutions, artificial intelligence (AI), and autonomous vehicles. Strong earnings reports and positive outlooks in these sectors could support the stock price. 3. Industry Trends: The demand for GPUs and data center services has been increasing, driven by the gaming industry, cryptocurrency mining (though this can be highly volatile), and the adoption of AI and machine learning technologies across various sectors. Any significant shifts in these trends could impact Nvidia's stock. 4. Economic and Regulatory Environment: Economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth can influence the stock market. Additionally, regulatory changes, especially those affecting the tech industry, can impact Nvidia's operations and stock price. 5. Historical Stock Price: Nvidia's historical stock price movements, particularly in relation to significant events and market conditions, can provide insights into how the stock might react to future events. Given these considerations and the relatively short time frame until the resolution date (July 31), predicting a close below $120 per share involves assessing the likelihood of a significant downturn in the stock price within a few days. Without access to real-time data or specific events occurring after my last update in April 2023, I would reason based on Nvidia's historical resilience and growth potential, alongside the broader market's capacity for rapid shifts. A sharp decline to below $120 would likely require significant negative news specific to Nvidia or a substantial market downturn. Therefore, without current data indicating a specific reason for such a decline, my reasoning leans towards it being less likely for Nvidia to close below $120 per share by 7/31, though market volatility means such an event cannot be ruled out entirely."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The French political landscape is dominated by several parties and coalitions, with the New Popular Front (Nouvelle Union Populaire \u00e9cologiste et sociale, NUPES) and Together (Ensemble) being significant players. NUPES is a left-wing coalition, while Ensemble is a centrist coalition that includes President Emmanuel Macron's party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche. Given the nature of coalition politics and the fact that the Prime Minister's appointment depends on the President's preference and the majority in the National Assembly, predicting the exact party affiliation of the Prime Minister on a specific date without current events is challenging. However, considering the historical context and the stability of French political institutions, significant changes in government composition usually follow elections or major political crises. As of my last update, President Macron's term was set to end in 2027, and without information on any extraordinary events leading to a change in government or the Prime Minister's party affiliation, one might lean towards the stability of the current political arrangement. However, the French political scene is known for its dynamism, and changes in coalition structures or the emergence of new political forces can alter the landscape.

Identify the Current Political Landscape: As of my last update, France's political landscape is dominated by several key parties and coalitions, including Emmanuel Macron's centrist coalition, the left-wing New Popular Front (Nouvelle Union Populaire \u00c9cologiste et Sociale, NUPES) led by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, and the right-wing National Rally (Rassemblement National) led by Marine Le Pen. The New Popular Front is a significant force, especially in the legislative elections, having secured a substantial number of seats in the National Assembly. 2. Consider the Stability of the Current Government: The stability of the current French government under Emmanuel Macron and the potential for changes leading up to July 2024 need to be assessed. Macron's government has faced various challenges, including protests and strikes against pension reforms, which could potentially destabilize the government or lead to a reshuffle. 3. Evaluate the Possibility of a Government Change: Given the current political tensions and the possibility of legislative or governmental changes, there's a chance that the Prime Minister's party affiliation could change. However, the French political system tends to favor stability between presidential elections, and significant changes in government composition without a presidential election are less common. 4. Consider the Time Frame: The question pertains to a very specific date, July 30, 2024, which is relatively close to the present. Major political upheavals are possible but less likely within such a short timeframe without a scheduled election or significant crisis prompting a government dissolution. 5. Assess the Role of the New Popular Front: The New Popular Front's ability to potentially become the party of the Prime Minister would depend on various factors, including its current political strength, public opinion trends, and the potential for a no-confidence vote or other mechanisms that could lead to a change in government. Given these considerations, the likelihood of the Prime Minister of France belonging to a coalition other than the New Popular Front by July 30, 2024, would seem relatively low, given the stability of the French political system and the lack of a scheduled election that could naturally lead to such a change within the specified timeframe.

The Cooperative Agreement between the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and Verisign has been in place since 1998, and it has been renewed several times since then. The current agreement is set to expire in 2025, but it can be terminated earlier if certain conditions are met. One possible reason for the termination of the agreement is the ongoing debate about the governance of the internet and the role of the US government in it. Some argue that the US government should not have a direct role in managing the internet, and that the management of the.com TLD should be transferred to an international organization. However, this debate has been ongoing for many years, and it is unclear whether it will lead to any changes in the agreement before August 3, 2024. Another possible reason for the termination of the agreement is the performance of Verisign as the manager of the.com TLD. If Verisign is found to be not meeting its obligations under the agreement, the DOC could potentially terminate the agreement. However, there is no public information available that suggests Verisign is not meeting its obligations.

This agreement has been in place for a long time, and its terms, including its duration and conditions for termination, are crucial for understanding the likelihood of its termination. 2. Termination Conditions: For the US government to end this agreement directly, specific conditions would need to be met, such as Verisign failing to fulfill its contractual obligations or significant changes in the policy governing the management of TLDs. 3. Historical Context and Stability: Historically, the management of.com TLD has been relatively stable under Verisign. Major changes to such agreements are typically preceded by long discussions, consultations with stakeholders, and clear signals of dissatisfaction or the need for change. 4. Policy Changes and Discussions: Any significant policy changes or discussions that could indicate a move towards terminating the agreement would likely be publicly known and debated within the relevant communities (e.g., ICANN, technology and internet governance forums).

Historically, medals in tennis have been distributed across various countries, indicating a competitive field but also a predictable pool of top-tier athletes who frequently win medals. 2. Competition Format: The Olympic tennis tournament typically features several events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. This variety increases the chances for multiple athletes to win medals. 3. Player Participation: Top tennis players, including those ranked in the ATP and WTA top 10, often participate in the Olympics. Their participation significantly influences the medal distribution, as these players are more likely to advance to the final rounds. 4. Country Representation: Some countries have a strong tradition of producing top tennis players and, consequently, Olympic medalists. This includes nations like the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and several European countries. 5. Upcoming Talent and Recent Performance: The tennis world is constantly evolving, with new players emerging and challenging the established stars. Recent performances in Grand Slam tournaments can provide insights into who might be a contender for an Olympic medal.

Anthropic's Focus on Safety: Anthropic is known for prioritizing AI safety. Given this focus, it's reasonable to assume they would be open to external scrutiny and feedback on their models' safety performance, which aligns with the practice of red-teaming. 2. Industry Trends and Best Practices: The AI industry, especially sectors dealing with advanced models like those developed by Anthropic, is increasingly recognizing the value of transparency and external validation. Red-teaming, as a practice, is becoming more acknowledged as a beneficial method for identifying vulnerabilities and improving model safety. 3. Regulatory and Public Pressure: There is growing regulatory and public pressure on AI companies to demonstrate the safety and accountability of their models. Publishing a report on external red-teaming efforts could be seen as a proactive step by Anthropic to address these concerns and build trust. 4. Timeline and Feasibility: The timeline from the question's creation (July 24, 2023) to the resolution date (June 30, 2024) provides approximately 11 months. This timeframe seems sufficient for organizing and conducting external red-teaming exercises, analyzing the results, and preparing a report for publication. 5. Potential Challenges and Uncertainties: Despite the points above, there are uncertainties. The process of external red-teaming can be complex, requiring coordination with external parties, which might face delays or other logistical challenges. Additionally, Anthropic might decide not to publish the results if they are deemed too sensitive or potentially revealing of proprietary information. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Anthropic publishing a report seems relatively high, given their focus on safety, industry trends, and the potential benefits of demonstrating transparency and accountability.

This historical context suggests that winning multiple medals is achievable for top athletes. 2. Competition Format: Tennis at the Olympics typically includes singles and doubles events for both men and women, as well as a mixed doubles event. The format allows athletes to compete in more than one event, increasing the potential for winning multiple medals. 3.

Some athletes might choose to focus on singles or doubles exclusively, while others may compete in both, affecting the overall distribution of medals. 4. Skill and Dominance: The level of skill and dominance of certain players can make it more likely for them to win multiple medals. For example, if a player is exceptionally skilled in both singles and doubles, they have a higher chance of winning medals in both events. 5. Injury and Fatigue: The physical demands of tennis, especially on the Olympic schedule, can lead to injuries or fatigue, potentially reducing an athlete's chances of winning multiple medals.

Geomagnetic storms are caused by changes in the Earth's magnetic field, often triggered by solar wind from the Sun. The Kp index is a scale used to measure the level of geomagnetic activity, ranging from 0 (quiet) to 9 (extremely disturbed). A Kp of 4 indicates a minor geomagnetic storm, while a Kp of 5 indicates a moderate geomagnetic storm. Historically, geomagnetic storms with Kp > 4 are relatively common, but most of them do not exceed Kp = 5. According to the German Research Center for Geosciences' 30-day history data product, which is the source for resolving this question, the frequency of geomagnetic storms with Kp > 4 is roughly a few times per month. However, storms with Kp > 5 are significantly less frequent, occurring about once every 1-3 months. Given the time frame of July 17 to July 28, 2024, which spans about 11 days, the likelihood of at least one geomagnetic storm with Kp > 4 occurring is relatively high. However, the specific condition of Kp being greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 narrows down the window. Since we are looking for the strongest geomagnetic storm in this period to meet the criteria, we should consider the probability of such a storm occurring at least once within the given time frame.

Firstly, the question is about whether there will be any break between chapters 40 and 42 of Kagurabachi, with a break defined as any amount of time significant enough for Shonen Jump to announce at the end of a chapter. This implies that breaks are a common enough occurrence to warrant such announcements. Without specific details on the series' update schedule or any patterns of breaks, we can only speculate based on common practices in manga publication. It's not uncommon for manga series to have breaks due to various reasons such as the author's health, research needs, or simply to allow for a buffer to ensure consistent quality and to avoid burnout. Given the resolution date is set for July 8, 2024, and assuming chapters are released on a weekly basis (a common schedule for many Shonen Jump titles), there would typically be a couple of weeks between chapters 40 and 42. However, this doesn't necessarily imply a break significant enough to be announced. Since we lack specific information on the series' history with breaks, the health and work habits of the creators, or any advance notices from reliable leakers, we must rely on general knowledge.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) grossing more than $15 million during its domestic opening weekend, we should consider several factors: 1. M. Night Shyamalan's Track Record: M. Night Shyamalan has a history of creating films with plot twists that often generate significant interest and discussion. His films like 'The Sixth Sense,' 'Unbreakable,' and more recently, 'Split' and 'Glass,' have performed well at the box office. However, his success is not uniform, with films like 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth' receiving negative reviews and underperforming. 2. Recent Performance: Looking at his recent films, 'Old' (2021) opened with $16,854,735, which is just above our target of $15 million. This suggests that Shyamalan still has the ability to draw audiences, despite mixed reviews. 3. Marketing and Public Interest: The marketing campaign for 'Trap' and the general public interest in the film will play a significant role in its opening weekend box office. Without specific details on the marketing efforts or audience anticipation metrics (like trailer views or social media buzz), it's challenging to gauge this aspect accurately. 4. Competition: The box office performance of 'Trap' will also depend on the competitive landscape at the time of its release. If it faces strong competition from other anticipated films, it might struggle to reach the $15 million mark. 5. Seasonality: The release date of 'Trap' could significantly impact its opening weekend. Summer releases often have the potential to perform well due to the vacation season and a generally more favorable market for blockbuster films. Considering these factors, while there's a degree of uncertainty without knowing the specifics of the film's marketing campaign, public reception, and competition, M.

Market trends: In the absence of specific data, I'll assume that the USD/JPY exchange rate has been relatively stable in the short term, with some fluctuations due to market conditions. 3.

Popularity of Characters and Franchise Success: Both Deadpool and Wolverine are highly popular characters within the X-Men franchise, which has a strong fan base. The success of previous films, especially 'Deadpool' (2016), which broke multiple box office records for R-rated films, suggests a strong potential for 'Deadpool & Wolverine'. 2. Marketing Efforts: The marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is expected to be extensive, given the popularity of the characters and the studio's understanding of the potential for this film. Effective marketing can significantly boost box office numbers. 3. Competition at the Time of Release: The box office performance of any movie is also dependent on the competition at the time of its release. A crowded release date with other highly anticipated films could potentially split the audience. 4. General Trends: There's been an observed trend of superhero fatigue among audiences in recent years, which could potentially affect the box office performance of 'Deadpool & Wolverine'. However, the unique blend of humor and action associated with Deadpool might mitigate this effect. 5. Inflation and Box Office Trends: Since the release of 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'The Wolverine' (2013), there has been inflation, and also changes in box office trends, which could affect how much money 'Deadpool & Wolverine' makes in comparison. Typically, more recent movies have a higher earning potential due to inflation and the growth of the global box office. Considering these factors, while there's a strong potential for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' to perform exceptionally well at the box office, the combined total of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' is substantial. The unique appeal of the characters, especially when combined, could lead to a significant box office opening, potentially surpassing the combined openings of the two previous films. However, estimating box office performance involves a lot of uncertainty, including factors like the quality of the film, audience reception, and external factors like economic conditions and global events.

Franchise Popularity and Momentum: The popularity of the characters involved can significantly impact box office performance. Deadpool, introduced as a solo character in the 2016 film, became a massive hit, breaking multiple box office records. The success was followed by 'Deadpool 2' in 2018, which, while not as groundbreaking as the first, still performed well. Wolverine, as a character, has a long history in the X-Men film series, but 'The Wolverine' (2013) was a solo outing that, while successful, didn't match the box office heights of the ensemble X-Men films or the more recent Deadpool movies. Combining Deadpool and Wolverine could potentially draw in fans of both characters, increasing its box office potential. 2. Marketing and Hype: The marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will play a crucial role in generating buzz and attracting audiences. Given the success of the Deadpool franchise, it's likely that the marketing will leverage the irreverent humor and action that fans have come to expect, potentially generating significant interest. In contrast, 'The Wolverine' was marketed more as a dramatic, action-oriented film, which, while appealing, might not have generated the same level of excitement among a broader audience. 3. Competition and Release Timing: The release date of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' and the competitive landscape at the time of its release will also be a factor. If it faces significant competition from other blockbuster films, its opening weekend might be affected. However, given the popularity of the characters involved, it's likely to still draw a substantial audience. 4. Cinematic Universe Interest: The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has grown exponentially since 'The Wolverine' was released. With Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox, the integration of the X-Men characters into the MCU has been a topic of much speculation and excitement. Fans might flock to see 'Deadpool & Wolverine' not just for the characters but also out of interest in how they might fit into the larger MCU, potentially boosting its box office.

First, we should consider the context and the current stance of OpenAI on this issue. OpenAI has been under pressure from various stakeholders, including researchers and experts in the field of AI, to be more transparent and open about the risks associated with its technology. The righttowarn.ai statement, which was published earlier, has added to this pressure. Given this context, it is possible that OpenAI may publicly commit to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle in order to alleviate some of this pressure and demonstrate its commitment to transparency and accountability. However, we should also consider the potential risks and challenges associated with making such a commitment. OpenAI may be hesitant to make a public commitment that could be seen as limiting its ability to respond to criticism or concerns about its technology. Additionally, the company may be concerned about the potential consequences of accepting the principle, such as increased scrutiny and criticism from stakeholders. Despite these potential risks and challenges, it is still possible that OpenAI may publicly commit to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle before July 1, 2024.

The men's 100m dash is one of the most prestigious events in track and field, with a rich history of record-breaking performances. The world record, as of my last update, stands at 9.48 seconds, set by Usain Bolt in 2009. This indicates that the best athletes in the world have been capable of running under 10 seconds for over a decade. Since Usain Bolt's retirement, several athletes have come close to his record, but none have broken it. However, the level of competition in the men's 100m dash remains incredibly high, with athletes like Christian Coleman, Noah Lyles, and Erriyon Knighton pushing the boundaries of speed. The progression of the world's top athletes suggests that there is a consistent effort to not just win but to also challenge existing records. Advances in training methods, sports science, and technology continue to aid athletes in improving their performances. This includes better understanding of biomechanics, nutrition, recovery techniques, and mental preparation. Such advancements increase the likelihood of athletes achieving faster times. The Olympics provide a unique stage where athletes often perform at their best due to the high stakes and competitive atmosphere. The presence of top athletes competing against each other in the finals can push individuals to achieve times they might not have otherwise. Given these considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a strong likelihood of at least one athlete running the men's 100m dash in under 10 seconds at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. The combination of historical precedent, current athletic talent, ongoing advancements in training and preparation, and the competitive nature of the Olympics all support this conclusion."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This suggests that Chung has the ability to create films that resonate with critics, which could positively influence the Rotten Tomatoes score. 2. **Cast Performance**: The film stars Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones, both of whom have been involved in successful projects ('Top Gun: Maverick' and 'Normal People,' respectively). The quality of the cast can often contribute to a film's critical reception, both in terms of their performance and the interest they generate in the project. 3. **Sequel and Franchise Considerations**: As a standalone sequel to the 1996 original 'Twister,' there might be both nostalgia and a built-in audience that could influence critics' perceptions. However, sequels can also be challenging to execute well, especially when trying to live up to the original. 4. **Genre and Market Trends**: The film's genre and the current market trends in film criticism also play a role. Action-adventure films, especially those with a scientific or disaster theme, can be well-received if executed well, but they can also be subject to more scrutiny regarding their scientific accuracy, plot coherence, and overall entertainment value.

Director's Track Record: Lee Isaac Chung, the director of 'Twisters' (2024), has a notable track record with 'Minari' (2020), which received widespread critical acclaim and has a 98% Tomatometer score on Rotten Tomatoes. This suggests that Chung has the ability to produce high-quality films that critics appreciate. 2. Cast Performance: The film stars Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar Jones, both of whom have been involved in successful projects. Glen Powell's performance in 'Top Gun: Maverick' (2022) was well-received, and Daisy Edgar Jones received critical acclaim for her role in 'Normal People' (2020). The cast's performance can significantly influence the critics' score. 3. Original Film's Reception: The original 'Twister' (1996) has a 63% Tomatometer score, which, while not exceptionally high, indicates a generally positive reception. Sequels can sometimes improve upon the original, especially with advancements in filmmaking technology and a fresh perspective from a new director. 4. Sequel and Franchise Dynamics: Being a standalone sequel, 'Twisters' (2024) has the potential to attract both old fans of the original and new audiences. This can lead to a broader appeal and potentially higher critical acclaim if the film successfully balances nostalgia with fresh storytelling. 5. Critical Reception Trends: The critical reception of films in the action/adventure genre, especially those involving natural disasters, can be quite varied. However, with a talented director and cast, the potential for a well-crafted story that resonates with critics is there. Considering these factors, while there is no guarantee of success, the elements in place suggest a positive inclination towards a higher critics' score.

Firstly, the historical context and the current state of relations between Iran and Israel are crucial. The two countries have a long-standing conflict, with Iran supporting various militant groups in the region that are hostile to Israel, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Israel has also conducted airstrikes in Syria targeting Iranian military assets and has been involved in a shadow war with Iran for years. Secondly, the political and military capabilities of Iran should be assessed. Iran has shown its ability to conduct or support attacks in the region, including drone and missile strikes. However, the effectiveness of these capabilities against Israel, which has a sophisticated defense system, is variable. Thirdly, the potential motivations for such an attack need to be considered. Iran might seek to retaliate against Israeli actions, such as airstrikes in Syria, or to deter future Israeli operations. The timing of any potential attack could also be influenced by broader geopolitical factors, including the status of Iran's nuclear program and the negotiations around it. Lastly, the threshold of 'at least five individuals' being killed in such an attack to resolve the question as 'yes' is a specific criterion that narrows down the scope of what constitutes a qualifying event. Given these considerations, while the potential for an attack exists due to the ongoing tensions and the capabilities of Iran, the specific criteria for the question (a deadly attack within Israel attributed to Iran resulting in at least five deaths before May 1, 2025) make it challenging to predict with certainty.

This trend suggests a relatively high likelihood of new countries achieving gold medals. 2.

More countries participating increases the potential for a country to win its first gold, but the high level of competition, especially in popular sports, makes it challenging for newcomers to break through. 3.

The Event: The event in question is Joe Biden dropping out of a political race, which we can infer is the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination or the presidency itself, given the context of the National Democratic Convention. 2. Media Coverage: The question asks if any media outlet will cover the story at least 6 hours in advance of the official announcement. This involves two parts: the existence of unofficial confirmation that Biden is dropping out and the media's ability to report on this confirmation. 3. Unofficial Confirmation: Unofficial confirmations can come from a variety of sources, including leaks from the campaign, Democratic Party officials, or other political insiders. Given the nature of political campaigns and the intense media scrutiny, it's plausible that rumors or leaks could circulate before an official announcement. 4. Media Outlet Reporting: The question specifies that local news, conspiracy websites, or comments by individual users on platforms like Manifold will not suffice. This implies that the coverage needs to come from reputable, mainstream media outlets. Given the competitive nature of political journalism, there is a strong incentive for media outlets to break significant stories first. 5. Historical Context: Historically, major political developments, including candidates dropping out of races, often see some level of media speculation or reporting before official announcements. This is due to the media's role in uncovering and reporting political news, as well as the difficulty in keeping such significant decisions entirely under wraps.

Current Market Trends and Stock Performance: As of my last update in April 2023, Nvidia's stock has seen significant fluctuations over the past year, influenced by the overall tech sector's performance, semiconductor demand, and the company's growth in areas like AI and gaming. If the current trend of volatility continues, there's a possibility that the stock could dip below $100, especially if there's a broader market correction or if Nvidia faces specific challenges. 2. Financial Health and Earnings Reports: Nvidia's financial performance has been strong, driven by its dominance in the GPU market and growth in emerging technologies. However, any unexpected weakness in earnings or guidance could lead to a stock price drop. 3. Industry Developments: The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes. Any significant advancements by competitors or unexpected shifts in demand for Nvidia's products could negatively impact its stock price. 4. Broader Economic Conditions: Economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth can influence the overall stock market, including Nvidia's stock. Economic downturns or increased interest rates could lead to a decrease in stock prices. Given these considerations, predicting the stock market's short-term movements is inherently uncertain. However, considering Nvidia's strong position in its markets and the potential for volatility in tech stocks, there seems to be a relatively low but not negligible chance of Nvidia's stock closing below $100 per share by July 31st, assuming no drastic changes in the company's or the global economic situation."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "040a161b-f9d8-4de7-afc4-e8b8b5bffd86", "title": "Will Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) close sub $100 per share by 8/31?", "body": "This market resolves to YES if NVDA closes below 100$ on any day before 8/31.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-31T23:40:30", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "created_date": "2024-07-25T20:02:42Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.25, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "Given Nvidia's financial health, industry trends, and market position, it is unlikely that the stock will close below $100 per share by August 31, 2024, without a significant negative catalyst."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given the specific range (greater than 75k and less than or equal to 76k) and the date (July 21, 2024), without access to real-time data or future events, we can only speculate based on general market behavior. Markets often experience fluctuations, and a range of 1,000 points (from 75,001 to 76,000) is relatively narrow for an index like the BSE SENSEX, which can easily move by a few hundred points in a single trading session. However, predicting such a specific range requires precise forecasting that is challenging without specific data on economic conditions, interest rates, inflation, and other factors as of July 2024. Given these considerations, and without specific data to guide a more precise prediction, we must rely on the understanding that markets can be volatile and the range specified is relatively narrow. The likelihood of the BSE SENSEX closing within such a specific range on a given day is difficult to predict with high confidence.

Tennis at the Olympics: Tennis has been a staple sport at the Olympic Games since its return in 1992 after a 64-year absence. It's a highly competitive sport with a global following, attracting top athletes from around the world. 2. Competition Format: The Olympic tennis tournament typically features several events, including men's and women's singles and doubles, and mixed doubles. This variety increases the chances for athletes to win medals, as there are more opportunities across different categories. 3. Athlete Participation: The world's top tennis players often participate in the Olympics, seeing it as a prestigious event that offers a unique opportunity to represent their countries on a global stage. The participation of top athletes increases the level of competition but also ensures that the best talents are vying for medals. 4. Historical Context: Historically, it is extremely rare for no medals to be awarded in tennis at the Olympics due to the structure of the tournament, which guarantees medal distribution across its events. Therefore, the question seems to be almost certain to resolve as 'Yes,' given the nature of the competition. 5. Consideration of Unforeseen Circumstances: The only scenarios in which no athlete would win at least one medal for tennis would involve extreme and unforeseen circumstances, such as the cancellation of the tennis events or a global situation that prevents the Olympics from taking place.

This indicates a higher likelihood of action being taken compared to a scenario where no investigation was underway. 2. Previous Actions by Trump: Donald Trump has been known for his controversial statements and actions, including those that could be interpreted as attempts to influence witnesses or the outcome of legal proceedings. If there is evidence of such behavior in the context of this case, it could increase the likelihood of charges being filed. 3. Legal Precedent and Standards: Witness tampering is a serious offense, and if there is substantial evidence that Trump engaged in such behavior, the legal system would likely take action to uphold the integrity of the judicial process. 4. Political and Public Pressure: The decision to charge a public figure like Donald Trump can be influenced by political considerations and public opinion. However, in a legal context, decisions are supposed to be based on evidence and the law, rather than political pressure. 5. Timeline: The question specifies a deadline of June 1, 2025, for the charges to be filed. This gives a considerable amount of time for the investigation to conclude and for any charges to be brought, assuming the evidence supports such action. Given these considerations, while it's impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of legal proceedings, the presence of an ongoing investigation, Trump's history of controversial actions, and the seriousness with which the legal system views witness tampering all suggest a plausible scenario where charges could be filed.

Firstly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been ongoing for decades, with periods of relative calm punctuated by outbreaks of violence. The situation in Gaza has been particularly volatile, with Israel launching several military operations in the territory in recent years. Secondly, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has been tracking Israeli military operations in Gaza, and their reports suggest that Israel has been gradually expanding its military presence in the territory. Thirdly, there are several potential triggers that could lead to an expansion of Israeli military operations in Gaza, including rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters, or the discovery of tunnels or other military infrastructure. However, there are also several factors that could mitigate the likelihood of an expansion, including international pressure on Israel to avoid escalating the conflict, the potential for diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions, and the risk of significant casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of Israel expanding its ground invasion to the southern Gaza Strip before June 1, 2024, is around 0.6.

First, it's clear that the perception of progress towards AGI has been steadily increasing among Manifold respondents. Previous polls have shown a consistent rise in the percentage of respondents who believe weak AGI has been achieved, from 15% in one poll to 27% in the June 2024 poll. This trend suggests a growing optimism or belief in the advancements towards AGI. Given that the polls do not define 'AGI' and rely on respondents' own understanding, the increase in positive responses could reflect either actual progress in AI capabilities or a broadening understanding and acceptance of what constitutes weak AGI among the respondents. Either way, this trend is a strong indicator of future poll outcomes. The specific market question at hand is whether at least 30% of respondents will agree that weak AGI has been achieved by July 23, 2024. Considering the steady increase and the most recent result being 27%, which is close to the 30% threshold, it's reasonable to anticipate that the trend could continue, especially given the relatively short period between polls. However, it's also important to note that the increase from one poll to the next has been gradual, and achieving a 3% increase (from 27% to 30%) might depend on significant developments or announcements in the field of AI that could influence respondents' opinions. Given these considerations, the probability that at least 30% of Manifold respondents will agree that weak AGI had been achieved before July 23, 2024, seems likely but not certain. The trend is positive, but the outcome could be influenced by various factors, including actual progress in AI and how respondents perceive such progress."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "c93c7663-fdc9-4c70-978d-fcb64bf1306e", "title": "Will at least 30% of Manifold respondents agree that weak AGI had been achieved before August 23, 2024?", "body": "[image]Every month, a Manifold poll is being posted to gain the consensus view of progress towards AGI.

Kenya's Involvement in International Peacekeeping: Kenya has been involved in various international peacekeeping missions, particularly within the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the United Nations. This history suggests that Kenya has the capacity and willingness to participate in international security efforts. 2. Haiti's Security Situation: Haiti has been facing significant security challenges, including gang violence and political instability. The international community, including the United Nations, has been involved in efforts to stabilize the country. Given the severity of the situation, it's plausible that international partners, including Kenya, might be called upon or volunteer to assist. 3. Logistical Considerations: Deploying military or police personnel requires significant logistical planning, including transportation, accommodation, and coordination with local and international authorities. Given the short timeframe (between May 22, 2024, and June 1, 2024), any such deployment would need to have been planned and set in motion prior to the question's creation on May 23, 2024. 4. Credible Sources and Reporting: The question specifies that the arrival of Kenyan personnel must be reported by credible sources. Given the international interest in Haiti's situation, deployments of foreign troops or police would likely be reported by reputable news agencies and official statements from involved governments. Considering these points, without specific information about Kenya planning to send personnel to Haiti, one must rely on the general context. The Kenyan government's willingness to participate in international peacekeeping, combined with Haiti's need for security assistance, makes it plausible. However, the short timeframe and lack of specific information about planned deployments make it uncertain. Given the lack of concrete evidence or announcements from Kenya or international organizations regarding such a deployment as of the last available information, the probability leans towards being lower.

Given her political position, her actions, including travel, can have political implications and are likely to be reported by credible sources. 2. Gagauzia and Russian Federation Relations: Gagauzia has historically maintained close cultural and economic ties with the Russian Federation. Given these ties, it's plausible that officials from Gagauzia, including the governor, might travel to Russia for diplomatic, economic, or cultural reasons. 3. Travel Restrictions and COVID-19 Considerations: As of my last update, the severe restrictions related to COVID-19 have been largely lifted in many parts of the world, including Russia. This makes international travel more feasible than it was during the height of the pandemic. 4. Political Climate and Tensions: The current geopolitical tensions, especially those related to the conflict in Ukraine, might affect travel and diplomatic engagements between certain countries and Russia. However, given Gagauzia's autonomy and its relationship with Russia, it's less likely to deter travel in this specific case. 5. Reporting and Credibility: The question specifies that the travel must be reported by credible sources. Given Evghenia Gu\u021bul's public position, any such travel would likely be reported by reputable news agencies or official statements. Considering these points, there's a reasonable likelihood that Evghenia Gu\u021bul could travel to the Russian Federation within the specified timeframe for diplomatic, economic, or other official reasons.

Number of Swimming Events: Swimming offers a large number of events, which increases the potential for swimmers to win multiple medals. The variety of strokes and distances means that a versatile swimmer can compete in several events, increasing their medal count. 3. Competition from Other Sports: While swimmers have historically performed well, athletes from other sports, such as gymnastics, track and field, and cycling, also have the potential to win multiple gold medals. The level of competition and dominance in these sports can sometimes rival that of swimming. 4. Current Talent Pool in Swimming: The current talent pool in swimming includes athletes who have shown the potential to win multiple gold medals. However, the actual performance can depend on various factors, including preparation, form during the Olympics, and the level of competition. 5. Injury and Performance Variability: All athletes are susceptible to injuries and variability in performance. These factors can significantly impact an athlete's ability to win gold medals. Considering these factors, while there is a strong historical precedent for swimmers winning multiple gold medals, the outcome can be influenced by a variety of unpredictable factors.

Current Polling Average: As of the question's creation on July 9, 2024, Trump's lead over Biden is 2.4 points. This is less than the 3-point threshold specified in the question but not far off. 2. Polling Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological differences among polls. However, significant shifts in a short period (like moving from a 2.4-point lead to a lead greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 in six days) are relatively uncommon, especially in a national polling average that tends to smooth out outliers. 3. Trend Direction: Without access to the most current data or trends, it's challenging to assess whether Trump's lead has been increasing, decreasing, or stable. If the trend as of the last available data showed Trump's lead increasing, this would make it more plausible for his lead to surpass the 3-point threshold. 4. Margin of Error and Statistical Noise: Polling averages, like individual polls, have margins of error. A move from 2.4 to above 3 but not exceeding 4 could be within the margin of error or simply statistical noise, especially considering the aggregation of various polls with their own methodologies and sample sizes. 5. Political Events and News Cycles: Political events, news cycles, and candidate actions between July 9 and July 15 could influence public opinion. However, predicting these events and their impact is highly speculative without specific information. Given these considerations, the most significant factors are the current polling average and the general stability of polling averages over short periods. While it's possible for Trump's lead to increase to the specified range, predicting such a precise movement within a narrow timeframe is challenging due to the inherent uncertainties in polling data and the potential for unforeseen political events. Therefore, without specific evidence of a strong trend towards Trump increasing his lead beyond 3 points or significant political events that could influence public opinion in his favor within the specified timeframe, the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 seems relatively low but not impossible."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "c4da4c21-ebd2-44b0-92d8-e72d215d79ff", "title": "Will Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "This question will resolve as Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's [national polling average for the 2024 presidential election](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/) as reported on the chart for the date of July 15, 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, a positive value means a Trump lead, while a negative value means Biden is leading.

First, it's essential to consider the historical trend of countries winning their first-ever Olympic gold medals. At each Olympics, there are usually a few nations that achieve this milestone. However, the number can vary significantly from one Olympics to another, depending on various factors such as the introduction of new sports, changes in the competitive landscape, and the participation of new countries. The introduction of new sports and events at the Olympics can significantly increase the chances of new countries winning gold medals. For the 2024 Paris Olympics, several new sports and events have been added, including breakdancing, sport climbing, skateboarding, and surfing. These additions provide fresh opportunities for countries that might not have been competitive in traditional Olympic sports to win medals. The number of participating countries and athletes can also impact the likelihood of new countries winning their first gold medals. The Olympics have seen a steady increase in participation over the years, which naturally increases the pool of potential first-time gold medal winners. The competitive balance in various sports can also play a crucial role. In some sports, the dominance of traditional powerhouses might be challenged by emerging nations, especially in events that are new to the Olympic program or where there has been significant development in less traditional Olympic countries. Identifying specific countries that have the potential to win their first gold medal is crucial. Countries that have shown improvement in certain sports, invested heavily in their Olympic programs, or have athletes who have recently risen to prominence in their respective sports could be on the cusp of winning their first Olympic gold. Given these considerations, while it is challenging to predict with certainty, the factors mentioned above, particularly the introduction of new sports and the broadening participation base, suggest that there is a reasonable chance of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal at the 2024 Olympics."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "e7e16172-8c86-4de2-bb59-61fa334adcd8", "title": "At the 2024 Olympics, will at least 3 countries win their debut gold medal?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if 3 or more countries win their first-ever Olympic gold medal at the Paris Olympics, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).

This recent precedent suggests a willingness to engage in such formats, increasing the likelihood of another occurrence. 2. Frequency of Interviews: The mention of several interviews (with Stephanopoulos, on Jimmy Fallon, and past appearances on 60 minutes) indicates that Biden regularly participates in various media engagements. Although these specific instances did not meet the 45-minute criterion, they demonstrate a pattern of media engagement that could occasionally include longer interviews. 3. Timeframe: The timeframe given (before the end of July 2024) is relatively short, which might limit the number of opportunities for such an interview to take place. However, given the significance of the upcoming presidential election and the general increase in media appearances that can be expected during election seasons, it's plausible that Biden's team might see value in longer, more in-depth interviews to reach voters. 4. Exclusions: The exclusion of press conferences, speeches, rallies, fundraisers, town halls, etc., narrows the scope of what counts towards resolving this question. However, the inclusion of appearances on podcasts, late-night shows, or edited interviews (like 60 minutes) provides a broad enough range of platforms where a qualifying interview could occur. 5.

This suggests that while not frequent, Biden is open to participating in extensive interviews. 2. Nature of the Interviews: The criteria for what constitutes a qualifying interview are quite specific, excluding common appearances like press conferences, speeches, and rallies. This narrows down the potential opportunities for such an interview to occur but highlights that there are specific platforms (like podcasts, late-night shows, or investigative journalism programs) where this could happen. 3. Political and Public Engagement Strategies: As the President of the United States, Joe Biden's public appearances and interviews are often strategically chosen to align with current events, policy initiatives, or to address specific audiences. Given the broad range of issues a president must address, there's always a potential need for in-depth interviews to reach certain demographics or to discuss complex issues in detail. 4. Timeframe: The question specifies a resolution by the end of July 2024. Given that this is during an election year in the United States, the likelihood of in-depth interviews might increase as part of campaign strategies to reach voters and discuss key issues. Considering these factors, while it's challenging to predict with certainty, there are plausible reasons to believe that Joe Biden might participate in an in-depth interview that meets the specified criteria before the end of July 2024. The strategic importance of such interviews for public engagement and policy discussion, especially in an election year, increases the likelihood. However, the specific criteria (in-person, 30+ minutes, excluding certain types of appearances) and the relatively short timeframe also introduce constraints that temper this likelihood.

First, we need to understand that the pole vault is a highly technical event where athletes' performances can significantly vary from one competition to another based on numerous factors, including weather conditions, equipment, and mental state. However, the 6.00m mark is a significant barrier that only a handful of athletes have ever cleared. Historically, the world record in men's pole vault has been above 6.00m since Sergey Bubka set it at 6.14m in 1994. However, Olympic competitions don't always see athletes reaching their personal bests or the world record heights due to the unique pressures and conditions of the Games. Looking at recent performances, several athletes have shown the capability to clear 6.00m or higher in competitions leading up to the Olympics. For example, Armand Duplantis of Sweden has consistently broken his own world record, setting it at 6.23m in March 2023. Other athletes, like Sam Kendricks of the USA and Renaud Lavillenie of France, have also shown the potential to clear the 6.00m barrier. Given this context, it's reasonable to assume that at least one athlete has a good chance of clearing 6.00m or higher at the 2024 Paris Olympics, considering the progression of the sport and the talents of current athletes. The presence of exceptional athletes like Duplantis significantly boosts the chances, as he has already demonstrated the ability to clear the bar at heights well above 6.00m.

Current Record and Progression: The current world record in the men's pole vault is 6.21 meters, set by Armand Duplantis in 2022. The Olympic record, however, is slightly lower. Given the recent progression in the sport, with athletes continually pushing the limits of human performance, it's plausible that the Olympic record could be broken. 2. Athlete Performance Trends: Athletes like Armand Duplantis have shown consistent improvement in their performances over the years. Duplantis himself has broken multiple records, indicating a strong upward trend in performance. Other athletes are also closing in on the current records, suggesting a competitive environment conducive to record-breaking. 3. Technological and Training Advances: Advances in pole technology, training methods, and athlete conditioning contribute to better performances. These ongoing improvements increase the likelihood of record-breaking performances. 4. Olympic Stage: The Olympics often bring out the best in athletes, with the event's prestige and competitive atmosphere motivating athletes to peak performances. This environment increases the likelihood of records being broken. 5.

This indicates that athletes are capable of achieving heights significantly above the 6.04m threshold for this question. 2. Athlete Performance Trends: Armand Duplantis and other top pole vaulters have been consistently pushing the limits of the sport, with multiple athletes clearing 6.00m or higher in recent competitions. This suggests a strong possibility of record-breaking performances at major events like the Olympics. 3. Competition Environment: The Olympics often bring out the best in athletes, with the high level of competition and the prestige of the event motivating athletes to peak performances. This environment could lead to a higher likelihood of record-breaking attempts. 4. Physical and Mental Preparation: Elite athletes typically plan their training to peak at major competitions like the Olympics. Given the importance of the event, it's reasonable to assume that top pole vaulters will be in optimal physical and mental condition, increasing the chances of exceptional performances. 5.

Although significant leaps in technology are less likely to occur in the short term, ongoing refinements could still facilitate better performances.

Understanding the Question: The question asks whether an athlete will win the most gold medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics. This means we are looking for an individual athlete, not a team, who tops the gold medal count. 2. Nature of the Olympics: The Olympics feature a wide range of sports, each with its own set of events. Some sports, like track and field (athletics), swimming, and gymnastics, offer multiple gold medals because they have many events. Other sports may only have a few or even just one gold medal available. 3. Athlete Specialization: Most athletes specialize in a specific sport and often in particular events within that sport. For instance, a sprinter might compete in the 100m and 200m races but is unlikely to participate in long-distance events or other sports. 4. Historical Context: Historically, athletes from sports with many events, such as swimming and gymnastics, have been among those winning the most gold medals in a single Olympics. Michael Phelps, a swimmer, holds the record for the most gold medals won by an individual in Olympic history. 5. Competition and Depth: The depth of talent in each sport can affect how many gold medals an individual can win. In sports with a deep pool of talented athletes, gold medals might be more spread out among different individuals. 6. Event Scheduling and Physical Demands: The ability of an athlete to compete in and win multiple events also depends on the scheduling of those events and the physical demands of each. For example, an athlete might find it feasible to compete in multiple sprint events but not in both sprint and long-distance events due to the different physical demands and recovery times required. Considering these factors, it's reasonable to expect that at least one athlete will emerge in the 2024 Paris Olympics who can win multiple gold medals, especially in sports like swimming, gymnastics, or track and field, where such feats have been achieved in the past."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The Philippines and China have had a complex relationship, with tensions primarily centered around territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The Philippines has been one of the most vocal critics of China's expansionist policies in the region. Despite these tensions, both countries have maintained diplomatic relations and have sought to manage their disputes through diplomatic channels. Several factors could lead to diplomatic expulsions or recalls: 1. Escalation of Territorial Disputes: An increase in confrontations or provocations in the South China Sea could escalate tensions to a point where diplomatic expulsions or recalls become a viable option for one or both countries. 2. Economic Pressures: Economic competition or disputes, particularly if they are perceived as unfair or threatening to national interests, could strain relations. 3. Nationalistic Sentiments: Rising nationalistic sentiments in either country could pressure governments to take a harder stance against the other, potentially leading to diplomatic expulsions or recalls. 4. Alignment with Other Global Powers: The Philippines' strengthening of ties with other countries, especially those seen as rivals to China (like the United States), could strain its relationship with China. However, there are also factors that suggest a lower likelihood of such actions: 1. Economic Interdependence: Both countries benefit from trade and economic cooperation, which acts as a stabilizing force in their relationship. 2. ASEAN Dynamics: The Philippines is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which seeks to maintain regional stability and promote dialogue. This framework can help in managing disputes. 3. Historical Precedent: Despite tensions, both countries have generally sought to maintain diplomatic channels open. Given these considerations, while there are certainly tensions and potential flashpoints in the relationship between the Philippines and China, both countries have shown a preference for maintaining diplomatic relations and managing disputes through dialogue. The likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls, therefore, seems relatively low but not impossible, especially if there is a significant escalation of current tensions."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

OpenAI's current stance and behavior: As of my last update, OpenAI has been known for its efforts in engaging with the broader AI ethics and safety community. However, the company's explicit commitment to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle, specifically as it pertains to satisfying the criteria set by righttowarn.ai, is what's in question here. 3. The role of righttowarn.ai: This initiative represents a collective effort by individuals concerned with the ethical development and deployment of AI, emphasizing the importance of whistleblowing and public risk disclosure without fear of retaliation. Their satisfaction with OpenAI's commitment is crucial for this question to resolve as 'Yes.' 4. OpenAI's potential commitment before July 1, 2024: Given the increasing scrutiny of AI companies and the growing importance of AI ethics and safety, it's plausible that OpenAI might publicly commit to this principle. Such a move would align with broader trends of tech companies addressing ethical concerns more proactively. 5. Verification by Metaculus: The question also hinges on Metaculus verifying that OpenAI's commitment satisfies at least one member of righttowarn.ai. This adds an additional layer of complexity, as it requires not just a public statement but also a level of acceptance from the relevant stakeholders. Given these considerations, while there's a trend towards greater transparency and ethical commitments in the tech industry, the specific commitment in question involves multiple variables (OpenAI's willingness, the satisfaction of righttowarn.ai members, and Metaculus's verification). Therefore, estimating a high probability might be overly optimistic without clear indications of OpenAI moving in this direction specifically. However, considering the general direction of the industry and the increasing importance of ethical considerations, it's reasonable to assign a moderate probability. This reflects the possibility of OpenAI making such a commitment while also acknowledging the uncertainties and complexities involved."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "44cacb67-46bd-4f6d-ad76-cab016610e08", "title": "Will OpenAI publicly commit to any transparency principle before July 1, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2024, OpenAI publicly commits to any transparency principle via a statement from the company or a company spokesperson, such as Sam Altman.

The average rating for Season 1 appears to be around 8.7, suggesting a strong overall reception. 2. **Season 2 Ratings:** For Season 2, the ratings provided show more variability, with scores ranging from 7.6 to 9.6. While there are fewer episodes above 8.5 compared to Season 1 in the data provided, episode 4 received a significantly high rating of 9.6, indicating that the show is still capable of producing highly acclaimed episodes. 3. **Trend Analysis:** It's common for TV shows to have fluctuating ratings over the course of a season, with some episodes resonating more with viewers and critics than others. Factors such as plot development, character arcs, and episode-specific themes can significantly impact an episode's rating. The variability in Season 2 ratings could suggest a more mixed reaction to this season's content, but the high rating of episode 4 indicates potential for future episodes to also score highly. 4. **Episode 7 Significance:** Without specific details on the content of episode 7, it's difficult to predict its rating accurately. However, given that it's past the midpoint of the season, episode 7 could be crucial in terms of plot development and setting up the season's conclusion. If executed well, this could lead to a higher rating. 5. **IMDB Rating Considerations:** IMDB ratings can be influenced by various factors, including fan loyalty, critical reception, and even external factors like current events or social media trends. The timing of when ratings are captured (two days after release) is also significant, as ratings can fluctuate over time as more viewers contribute their scores. Considering these points, while there's some variability in Season 2 ratings, the overall positive reception of the show, combined with the potential for episode 7 to be a critical episode in the season, suggests a decent chance of it receiving a rating above 8.5."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "3cdaf62a-4841-4e75-81da-03e428766121", "title": "Will \"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 (title TBA) be rated >8.0 on IMDB, 2 days after release?", "body": "Resolution\n\n\"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 (title TBA) IMDB link\n\nThis market resolves based on the score displayed two days after release (July 30th), at noon PT.\n\nThis market closes 90 minutes after the episode premieres.\n\nI will use the precision listed by IMDB (typically a single decimal), and this is a strict inequality. \n\nContext\n\nHere are the current IMDB ratings for HotD:\n\nSeason 1\n\nE1: 8.7\n\nE2: 8.3\n\nE3: 8.7\n\nE4: 8.4\n\nE5: 8.5\n\nE6: 8.0\n\nE7: 9.1\n\nE8: 9.3\n\nE9: 8.7\n\nE10: 9.2\n\nSeason 2\n\nE1: 8.4\n\nE2: 8.4\n\nE3: 7.9\n\nE4: 9.6\n\nE5: 7.6\n\nE6: ???", "resolution_date": "2024-07-30T19:04:59", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "created_date": "2024-07-22T04:31:42Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.85, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "The series has a history of high ratings, and the most recent episode received an exceptionally high score.

As of my last update in April 2024, the situation in Eastern Ukraine, where Chasiv Yar is located, has been volatile with both sides experiencing gains and losses. However, without real-time data, it's challenging to assess the current control status of Chasiv Yar directly. Russia has shown a significant commitment to gaining and maintaining control over areas in Eastern Ukraine, often through intense artillery bombardments and infantry assaults. Ukraine, on the other hand, has been conducting counteroffensives and has shown resilience and adaptability in its defense strategies. Ukraine's military capabilities have been bolstered by international support, including military aid from Western countries. The international community's stance on the conflict could influence the situation. Sanctions against Russia, military aid to Ukraine, and diplomatic efforts could all impact the balance of power on the ground. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides regular assessments of the conflict, including maps that indicate control areas. Their assessments take into account various sources of information, including satellite imagery, social media reports, and official statements from both sides of the conflict. Given these factors, predicting the exact status of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, involves a high degree of uncertainty. However, considering the ongoing conflict dynamics, where both sides have shown the ability to gain and lose territory, a cautious approach would be to not heavily favor one outcome over the other without more current data.

Incumbency and Primary Challenges: If Joe Biden decides to run for re-election, the dynamics of the primary season could be significantly altered. Incumbent presidents often face fewer primary challenges, which could reduce the number of debates. However, if Biden does not run, or if he faces significant primary opposition, more debates could be organized to help the party select its nominee. 3. Democratic Party's Strategic Decisions: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) plays a crucial role in organizing debates. The DNC might decide to host debates based on the perceived need for candidates to have a platform to discuss their policies, especially if there are significant policy differences among the contenders or if the party sees debates as a strategic tool to mobilize its base. 4. Candidate Participation and Fundraising: Candidates' willingness to participate in debates can also influence the number of debates held. Candidates with significant fundraising advantages might avoid debates to minimize risks, while underdog candidates might push for more debates to gain visibility. 5. Public Interest and Media Demand: The level of public interest and media demand for debates can also influence the decision to hold them. If there's significant public or media pressure for candidates to debate, this could increase the likelihood of debates occurring. Given these considerations, and in the absence of specific information about Joe Biden's intentions or the number of serious primary challengers, it's reasonable to assume that there will be some level of debate among Democratic candidates before the 2024 election, especially if the primary season is competitive. However, the exact number of debates and their timing would depend on the factors mentioned above."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.03328653727815262, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.01664326863907631, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2578172208175278, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical Context: In previous presidential election cycles, debates among candidates of the same party have been common, especially as the primary elections approach. These debates serve as platforms for candidates to articulate their policies, differentiate themselves from their opponents, and gain visibility among voters. 2. Current Political Landscape: The Democratic Party is currently in a position where several potential nominees have expressed interest or are rumored to be considering a run for the presidency. Figures like Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, and the incumbent President Joe Biden represent a diverse range of policies and political styles within the party. 3. Primary Elections and Debates: Debates are a crucial part of the primary election process. They are organized by various entities, including news organizations and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) itself. Given the diversity of candidates and the importance of the 2024 presidential election, there is a strong incentive for organizing debates to help voters make informed decisions. 4. Resolution Criteria: The question resolves to YES if there is at least one debate among potential Democratic nominees before the 2024 Democratic National Convention. This convention typically marks the end of the primary election season and the point at which the party officially nominates its candidate for the presidency. 5. Timing and Scheduling: The resolution date is set for August 12, 2024, which is around the time the Democratic National Convention might take place, considering past schedules. This means there is a window of opportunity for debates to occur before the convention. Given these considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a strong likelihood of at least one more Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention. The presence of multiple candidates, the importance of debates in the primary process, and the timing relative to the convention all support this conclusion."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "f71c5f6f-b4d9-4dc1-aa9d-f1d71ac81312", "title": "Will there be another presidential debate?", "body": "Resolves YES if there is a debate between potential presidential nominees (from any political party) prior to the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

The success of 'Deadpool' (2016) was a milestone for R-rated comic book movies, indicating a strong appetite for such films. The combination of these two characters could potentially draw an even larger audience. 2. Marketing and Hype: The marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is expected to capitalize on the popularity of both characters, potentially generating significant hype. The success of such campaigns can greatly influence box office openings. 3. Competition and Release Timing: The release date of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' and the competitive landscape at that time will play a crucial role. A release window with minimal competition from other blockbuster films could favor a higher opening. 4. Cinematic Universe and Crossover Appeal: The film's integration into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) or its appeal as a crossover event could attract a broader audience, including fans who might not have been as interested in the standalone films. 5. Critical Reception and Word-of-Mouth: Early reviews and audience reactions can significantly impact the opening weekend. Positive buzz can lead to higher-than-expected numbers, while negative reviews might dampen enthusiasm. 6. Inflation and Box Office Trends: Since the release of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine,' there has been inflation, and box office trends have evolved. These factors naturally lead to higher box office numbers over time for similarly successful films. Considering these factors, the combination of two highly popular characters in a new film, along with the potential for a well-executed marketing campaign and the natural inflation of box office numbers over time, suggests a high likelihood that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could surpass the combined opening of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine.'"}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "9233cb0b-5311-447f-86e9-433b9d711fb0", "title": "Will the domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" be higher than that of \"Deadpool\"?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if the domestic box office opening for the **Deadpool & Wolverine** reported by Boxofficemojo on the [movie's page](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6263850/?ref_=bo_se_r_1) is higher than $132,434,639 which is the box opening for **Deadpool** (2016).", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T20:06:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "created_date": "2024-07-18T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.75, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability of the domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' being higher than that of 'Deadpool,' we need to consider several factors, including the popularity of the characters, the success of previous films in the franchise, marketing efforts, competition at the time of release, and general audience anticipation. 1. Character Popularity and Franchise Success: Both Deadpool and Wolverine are extremely popular characters within the X-Men universe, which has a large and dedicated fan base. The success of previous films, especially the Deadpool movies, indicates a strong potential for box office performance. Combining these two characters could potentially double the interest and excitement among fans. 2. Marketing Efforts: The marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' would likely be extensive, given the popularity of the characters and the success of previous films. Effective marketing can significantly boost the box office opening by generating widespread interest and hype. 3. Competition at the Time of Release: The box office performance of any movie is also dependent on the competition it faces upon release. A crowded release date with other highly anticipated films could potentially split the audience and affect the opening numbers. 4. General Audience Anticipation: The anticipation for a film featuring both Deadpool and Wolverine would likely be high, given the unique dynamic between the characters and the potential for a compelling storyline. This anticipation can translate into a strong opening weekend as fans rush to see the movie. 5. Inflation and Box Office Trends: Since the release of 'Deadpool' in 2016, there has been inflation, and box office trends may have changed. Typically, this would mean that newer films have a higher potential for larger opening weekends due to increased ticket prices and possibly a larger audience base. Considering these factors, the combination of two highly popular characters, the success of previous films, and the likely extensive marketing efforts suggest a strong potential for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' to have a higher domestic box office opening than 'Deadpool.'

As of my last update, the political situation in France is characterized by a complex interplay of parties and coalitions, with the New Popular Front (Nouvelle Union Populaire \u00c9cologiste et Sociale, NUPES) and Together (Ensemble) being significant forces. NUPES is a left-wing coalition, while Ensemble is a centrist coalition that has been the ruling force under President Emmanuel Macron. Given the nature of French politics, coalition governments are common, and shifts in allegiances or new elections can significantly alter the political landscape. However, predicting such shifts with precision is challenging without specific, up-to-date information on current political negotiations, public opinion polls, or scheduled elections. As of the creation of this question (July 10, 2024), there are a few weeks before the resolution date (July 30, 2024), which is a relatively short period for major political upheavals leading to a change in the Prime Minister's party affiliation, especially considering the institutional stability provided by Macron's presidency. Nonetheless, in politics, unexpected events can occur, and negotiations behind closed doors can lead to rapid changes in the governing coalition. Without current polls or specific indicators of a looming change in the French government's composition, it's reasonable to lean towards the status quo, assuming that the Prime Minister's party as of the question's creation is likely to remain unchanged by the resolution date.

Current Record and Winning Heights: The current Olympic record for the men's pole vault is 6.03m. Recent winning heights in major competitions, such as World Championships and previous Olympics, have been close to but not necessarily exceeding this mark. However, the trend in pole vault heights over the years has shown a gradual increase, indicating improvements in athlete performance, technology, and training methods. 2. Athlete Performance Trends: Leading up to the 2024 Olympics, several athletes have shown the capability to vault at or near the record height. The performance of top athletes in the 2023 World Championships and other major meets can provide insight into the likelihood of the record being matched or exceeded. If multiple athletes have been consistently clearing heights above 6.00m, it increases the likelihood of the record being matched or broken. 3. Competition Environment: The Olympic Games often bring out the best in athletes due to the high stakes and intense competition environment. The atmosphere and the fact that athletes peak their training for this event can lead to extraordinary performances. Additionally, advancements in pole technology and the specific conditions of the Olympic venue (such as the runway and landing pit quality) can also influence performance. 4. Injury and Health Factors: The health and injury status of top athletes going into the Olympics can significantly impact the competition. If key competitors are dealing with injuries, it could reduce the likelihood of record-breaking performances. Given these considerations, and without access to real-time data on athlete performances leading up to the 2024 Olympics, it's reasonable to assume that there's a potential for the record to be matched or exceeded, especially considering the gradual increase in performance levels over time and the competitive nature of the Olympic Games. However, predicting a record in a specific event with certainty is challenging due to the variables involved, including athlete health, competition day conditions, and the psychological factors at play during high-pressure events.

Historically, Israel and Iran have been involved in a proxy conflict for years, with Israel often targeting Iranian assets and personnel in Syria and elsewhere. However, a direct attack within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation. Current tensions between Israel and Iran are high, particularly over Iran's nuclear program. Israel has repeatedly stated its opposition to Iran's nuclear ambitions and has threatened military action if necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Regional dynamics also play a role. The Abraham Accords have normalized relations between Israel and some Arab states, potentially creating a more favorable environment for Israeli military action against Iran. However, other regional actors, such as Russia and Turkey, might have interests that could influence Israel's decision-making. Given these factors, while there is a clear motive for Israel to consider military action against Iran, the risks and potential consequences of such an attack, including the potential for retaliation and escalation, are significant.

To answer this question, we must consider the historical context of the relationship between Israel and Iran, the current geopolitical tensions, and any recent developments that may indicate an escalation of conflict. Israel and Iran have a long-standing adversarial relationship, with tensions often centered on Iran's nuclear program, its support for militant groups in the region, and Israel's military actions in Syria. While direct military confrontations between the two countries are rare, there have been instances of Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq. Given the time frame of the question (before May 1, 2024), it's essential to consider any recent events or statements that might suggest an increased likelihood of an Israeli attack on Iran. However, as of the last available information, there were no clear indicators of an imminent large-scale attack by Israel on targets within Iran that would lead to significant casualties. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran that results in the death of at least five individuals before May 1, 2024, appears low, given the absence of clear indicators of an imminent attack.

Israel has consistently stated its opposition to Iran's nuclear ambitions and has taken covert actions in the past to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. Secondly, Israel has demonstrated its military capabilities to conduct long-range strikes, including those within Iran. For instance, Israel has been accused of conducting airstrikes in Syria against Iranian military targets and has also been linked to the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. However, carrying out an attack within Iran's borders comes with significant risks, including the potential for retaliation from Iran and its proxies, which could lead to a wider conflict. Additionally, such an attack could strain Israel's relationships with other countries, including the United States, which has been seeking to reduce tensions with Iran.

Understanding the Movies Involved: - Deadpool (2016): This film was a groundbreaking success, known for its unique blend of humor, action, and breaking the fourth wall. It resonated well with audiences and critics alike, leading to a significant box office success. - The Wolverine (2013): This movie, while part of the larger X-Men franchise, received mixed reviews and had a more modest box office performance compared to Deadpool. - Deadpool & Wolverine: This upcoming film combines two of the most popular characters from the X-Men universe. Given the success of Deadpool and the popularity of Wolverine, there's a high potential for a significant box office opening. 2. Market Trends and Audience Interest: - The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine in a single film is likely to generate considerable interest among fans of both characters and the broader X-Men franchise. - The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has seen consistent success with its movies, and although Deadpool & Wolverine might not be directly part of the MCU (considering the rights and universe complexities), it's likely to benefit from the general enthusiasm for superhero movies. 3. Inflation and Box Office Trends: - Since the release of Deadpool in 2016 and The Wolverine in 2013, there has been inflation, and box office trends have generally seen an increase in opening weekend numbers for highly anticipated films. - The post-pandemic era has shown a recovery in box office numbers, with several movies breaking records or performing well above expectations. 4. Competition and Release Timing: - The success of the movie also depends on its release date, marketing campaign, and the competitive landscape at the time of its release. A well-placed release date with minimal competition from other blockbuster films could enhance its opening weekend performance. Considering these factors, the combination of two highly popular characters in a new film, the general trend of increasing box office numbers for superhero movies, and assuming a well-executed marketing campaign and favorable release timing, it's reasonable to anticipate that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could have a higher domestic box office opening than the combined openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine.'"}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "be1a8649-6f30-4be0-8751-0910087ef517", "title": "Will the domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" be higher than $132,434,639?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if the domestic box office opening for the **Deadpool & Wolverine** reported by Boxofficemojo on the [movie's page](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6263850/?ref_=bo_se_r_1) is higher than $132,434,639, which is the box opening for **Deadpool** (2016).", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T14:38:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "created_date": "2024-07-16T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.75, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "Given the addition of Wolverine to the franchise, which likely increases its appeal, the generally positive reception to both characters in past films, and assuming a robust marketing campaign, it seems reasonable to expect that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could outperform the original's domestic box office opening."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The progression of the record over the years shows a trend of gradual improvement, but significant jumps are less common. 2. Athlete Performance Trends: Leading athletes in the men's pole vault have been consistently clearing heights close to the record in recent competitions. For example, Armand Duplantis of Sweden has been a dominant force, setting multiple world records, including the current world record of 6.23m in March 2023. This indicates that the top athletes are capable of breaking the Olympic record. 3. Competition Environment: The Olympic Games often bring out the best in athletes due to the high level of competition and the prestige of winning an Olympic medal. This environment can lead to exceptional performances that might not occur in regular competitions. 4. Injury and Form: The condition of key athletes going into the Olympics is crucial. An injury to a top contender could significantly reduce the chances of the record being broken. 5.

Duplantis, in particular, has been in exceptional form, breaking his own world record multiple times. The presence of such high-performing athletes at the Olympics increases the likelihood of the record being broken. The conditions at the Olympic venue, including the track, weather, and crowd support, can significantly impact performance. Paris, being a familiar and supportive environment for many European athletes, including Duplantis, could potentially enhance performances.

Given the information available up to the creation of this question in July 2024, without specific details on current controversies, criticisms, or the general political climate that could directly impact Director Cheatle's position, we have to rely on more general considerations: 1. Tenure and Stability: If Director Cheatle has been in the position for a relatively short period, there might be less reason to expect her resignation unless there have been significant controversies or criticisms. Conversely, a longer tenure might indicate stability but also increases the likelihood of eventual turnover due to various factors. 2. Historical Context: The turnover rate among high-ranking government officials can be relatively high due to the demanding nature of the jobs and political pressures. However, without specific historical data on the tenure lengths of previous Secret Service directors, it's challenging to apply this context directly to Cheatle's situation. 3. Upcoming Events: Significant events, such as elections or major political shifts, can influence appointments and resignations.

Google DeepMind's Focus on Safety: Google DeepMind has been at the forefront of AI research and development, and with that, they have also emphasized the importance of AI safety. They have shown a commitment to understanding and mitigating the risks associated with advanced AI systems. This commitment suggests that they have a vested interest in conducting and publishing safety assessments of their models. 2. External Red-Teaming: The concept of red-teaming involves a group of experts simulating adversarial attacks or scenarios against a system to test its defenses and robustness. External red-teaming specifically means that the assessment is conducted by parties outside of the organization that developed the AI model. This approach is valuable for identifying vulnerabilities that may not be apparent to the developers themselves. Given the growing recognition of the importance of AI safety, it's plausible that Google DeepMind would engage in such practices to enhance their models' security and reliability. 3. Publication of Results: The question requires that the results of such an external red-teaming effort be made public by December 31, 2024. Google DeepMind, as well as its parent company Alphabet, have a history of publishing research and findings related to AI. This transparency is beneficial for advancing the field and fostering trust among the public and the research community. However, the decision to publish specific results, especially those related to vulnerabilities, might depend on various factors, including the nature of the findings and potential implications for their products and services. 4. Timeline: The deadline for the publication is December 31, 2024. Given the pace of advancements in AI and the growing emphasis on safety, it's reasonable to expect that Google DeepMind would prioritize such assessments. However, the timeline might be influenced by factors such as the complexity of the models being tested, the availability of external red-teaming resources, and the company's publication and review processes. Considering these points, it seems plausible that Google DeepMind would engage in external red-teaming of their models for safety and publish the results. This practice aligns with their commitment to safety and transparency, and it would be a valuable contribution to the broader AI research community."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.003142234993865938, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.001571117496932969, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07920559147847751, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The success of previous films, especially the Deadpool movies, indicates a strong interest in these characters. Given the growth in popularity over time, combining these two characters could potentially attract a larger audience than their individual films. 2. Marketing and Hype: The announcement of a combined Deadpool and Wolverine film has generated considerable hype among fans and the general public. Effective marketing strategies could capitalize on this excitement, potentially leading to a higher opening weekend box office than the combined openings of the individual films. 3. Cinematic Universe Expansion: The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has shown that expanding a cinematic universe can lead to increased box office success. By combining Deadpool and Wolverine, the film might appeal to fans of both characters and newcomers interested in the broader universe, potentially surpassing the combined openings of the standalone films. 4. Competition and Release Timing: The success of a film's opening weekend is also dependent on the competitive landscape at the time of its release. A strategic release date with minimal competition from other blockbuster films could contribute to a higher opening weekend box office. 5. Critical Reception and Word-of-Mouth: Positive early reviews and strong word-of-mouth can significantly impact a film's opening weekend. If 'Deadpool & Wolverine' receives favorable reviews, it could encourage more viewers to see the film during its opening weekend, potentially surpassing the combined total of the individual films.

External red-teaming, where an independent party attempts to find vulnerabilities or flaws in a system, is becoming a best practice for ensuring AI systems are robust and safe. Given its prominence in the field, Google DeepMind is likely to follow or even set such best practices. 3. Public and Regulatory Pressure: There is growing public and regulatory interest in the safety and ethics of AI systems. Governments and regulatory bodies are starting to demand more transparency and accountability from AI developers. This external pressure could encourage Google DeepMind to publicly demonstrate their commitment to safety through external red-teaming and publication of the results. 4. Publication and Transparency: Google DeepMind has a history of publishing research and findings related to their AI developments. This culture of transparency suggests they are likely to publish the results of any significant safety assessments, including external red-teaming efforts.

Its movement is influenced by a wide range of factors including economic policies, global market trends, company earnings, and geopolitical events. Given the specific range (greater than 75k and less than or equal to 76k), we're looking at a relatively narrow window which suggests we are considering a scenario where the market is fairly stable with no major anticipated shifts in the immediate short term. As of my last update in early 2024, the global economy and markets have been navigating through challenges such as inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions. However, markets like the BSE SENSEX have also shown resilience and the ability to recover from downturns. Given the narrow range specified in the question and without specific details on the current market conditions, economic indicators, or any significant events anticipated around July 21, 2024, that could drastically affect the BSE SENSEX, we must rely on the general understanding of market behavior.

The success of these films, along with other Marvel movies, has likely expanded the fan base, potentially leading to a higher box office opening for 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' 2. Inflation and Box Office Trends: Since 2013 and 2016, ticket prices have increased due to inflation. This natural increase in ticket prices could contribute to a higher box office opening for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' without necessarily indicating more tickets sold. 3.

A strategic release date avoiding major blockbusters could help 'Deadpool & Wolverine' achieve a higher opening. 5. Critical Reception and Previews: Positive early reviews and previews can significantly impact a movie's opening weekend.

Since then, the franchise has expanded, and the inclusion of Wolverine, another highly popular character from the X-Men universe, could potentially increase interest and attract a broader audience. 2.

If the trailers and promotional materials generate significant buzz and excitement, this could lead to a higher opening weekend. Given the popularity of both characters, it's plausible that the marketing efforts could surpass those of the original \"Deadpool.\" 3. Competition and Release Date: The release date of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" and the competitive landscape at the time of its release will also play a crucial role. If it faces less competition from other blockbuster films, it has a higher chance of securing a larger opening weekend. 4. Cultural and Social Context: The cultural and social context in 2024 might be different from 2016, potentially affecting audience preferences and box office performance. However, the core fanbase for both Deadpool and Wolverine remains strong, suggesting a consistent level of interest. 5.

Current Political Context: As of my last update, there was no widely known or imminent plan for Vice President Harris to assume the presidency. The presidency changes hands due to elections, resignations, incapacitation, or death of the incumbent. Without specific information suggesting any of these scenarios are likely to occur within the given timeframe, we must rely on general probabilities of such events happening. 2. Health and Incapacitation: The health and well-being of the current President would be a critical factor. However, without specific information about the President's health being in jeopardy, it's challenging to assign a high probability based on this criterion alone. 3. Resignation or Removal: Presidential resignations are rare, and the process of removing a President (impeachment and subsequent Senate trial) is lengthy and politically charged. Given the short timeframe (less than a week from the creation of this question to its resolution), this seems highly unlikely unless there was an extremely rapid development that would expedite such a process. 4. Historical Precedent: Historically, transitions to an acting president or a new president outside of election cycles are rare and usually occur with some notice or under extraordinary circumstances. Given these considerations and without specific, credible information indicating an imminent change, the probability of Vice President Kamala Harris being formally designated as President or Acting President before the specified date would be considered low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Time Frame: The question is asking about a lead on July 15, 2024, which is only about 10 days from the creation of the question. In the short term, significant shifts are less likely but not impossible, especially given the fast-paced nature of political campaigns. 4. Historical Trends: Past elections have shown that while leads can change, a consistent lead (positive or negative) in the short term before an event (like a primary or the actual election) can be indicative of future performance, but this is a general election scenario which is far from the actual election date. 5. Margin of Error: Most polls have a margin of error, typically around 3-4%. Given that the lead in question is about 2 points, fluctuations within the margin of error could easily change the scenario. Given these considerations, while Trump has a current lead, the lead is not significantly greater than the margin of error for most polls, and given the potential for fluctuations in public opinion, external events, and the natural variability of polling, it seems there is a reasonable chance that Trump's lead could remain greater than 2 points, but it's far from certain."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, Season 2 has shown a bit more variability in ratings, with a dip as low as 6.1 for E6. 2. Season Finale Expectations: Season finales often receive higher ratings due to their conclusive nature, tying up storylines or setting up significant plot points for the next season. Fans and viewers tend to anticipate these episodes more, which can lead to higher viewer satisfaction and, consequently, higher ratings. 3. Fan and Viewer Anticipation: The anticipation for a season finale, especially one that follows a somewhat uneven season in terms of ratings, might be higher. Fans might be looking forward to seeing how the season wraps up, potentially leading to a more favorable rating if the episode delivers on expectations. 4. Potential for Higher Engagement: Given the variability in ratings this season, there's a possibility that viewers are eagerly awaiting a redeeming finale. If the episode meets or exceeds expectations, it could lead to a higher rating as fans might feel more inclined to support the show by giving it a positive review. However, considering the variability in ratings this season, there's also a risk that the finale might not meet everyone's expectations, which could result in a lower rating.

Historical Context: Israel and Iran have had tense relations for decades, with Israel viewing Iran's nuclear program as a significant threat to its national security. This tension has led to numerous covert operations and military strikes attributed to Israel within Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, military personnel, and scientists. 2. Recent Developments: In recent years, there has been an escalation in the covert war between Israel and Iran, with attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, assassinations of scientists, and strikes on military targets. Iran has also been expanding its nuclear program, enriching uranium to higher levels, which Israel sees as an existential threat. 3. Geopolitical Landscape: The region is experiencing heightened tensions, with the conflict in Ukraine and the involvement of major powers like the United States and Russia potentially influencing the dynamics between Israel and Iran. The negotiations around the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) have stalled, leaving the status of Iran's nuclear program uncertain. 4. Israeli Elections and Government Posture: The posture of the Israeli government, especially under right-wing administrations, has historically been more aggressive towards Iran. The outcome of recent or upcoming elections could influence the likelihood of such an attack. Given these factors, it is reasonable to assume that the likelihood of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2025, is significant. The ongoing tensions, the perceived threat from Iran's nuclear program, and the history of covert operations suggest a heightened probability.

However, the rate of improvement can be slow and incremental. 2. Recent Performances: As of my last update, several athletes have been performing close to the record height in various international competitions. The ability of current top athletes to consistently clear heights above 5.80m suggests that the talent pool is strong enough to potentially challenge the record. 3. Competition Pressure: The Olympics represent the pinnacle of competition for many athletes, often bringing out peak performances. The psychological factor of competing on the biggest stage can sometimes propel athletes to achieve beyond their previous best, which could increase the likelihood of the record being matched or broken. 4. Injury and Form: The condition of top athletes at the time of the Olympics is crucial. Injuries or being out of form can significantly reduce the chances of record-breaking performances.

The situation in Gaza and the surrounding areas, including Rafah, has been particularly volatile, with military operations and exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups. 2. Historical Context: Israel has conducted ground invasions in the Gaza Strip in the past, notably in 2008-2009 (Operation Cast Lead) and 2014 (Operation Protective Edge), in response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants. These operations included significant military presence in various parts of Gaza, including areas around Rafah. 3. Conditions for 'Yes' Resolution: For this question to resolve as 'Yes,' the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) must report Israeli military operations at any of six specific locations surrounding Rafah before June 1, 2024. Given the targeted nature of these locations, even a limited operation could meet the criteria if it involves any of these areas. 4. Likelihood of Expansion: The decision to expand military operations into Rafah would depend on various factors, including the level of militant activity in the area, the broader security situation in Gaza, and diplomatic considerations. Given the historical precedent and the ongoing tensions in the region, it is plausible that Israel could undertake targeted operations in Rafah in response to perceived security threats. 5. Reporting by ISW: The ISW is a reputable source for conflict monitoring. Their reporting is detailed and often includes specific locations of military activity. If Israeli military operations were to occur in the designated areas around Rafah, it is likely that ISW would document these activities. Given these considerations, while it is impossible to predict with certainty, the ongoing nature of the conflict, historical precedents, and the specificity of the conditions for a 'Yes' resolution suggest a significant probability that the criteria could be met before June 1, 2024."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "1e77667d-f56c-4901-bd46-ef578a34dbe5", "title": "Will Israel expand its ground invasion to the Gaza Strip before June 1, 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve **Yes** if the [Institute for the Study of War](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2e746151991643e39e64780f0674f7dd) (ISW) reports Israeli military operations on its map at any location within the Gaza Strip before June 1, 2024.", "resolution_date": "2024-05-31T22:00:31Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "created_date": "2024-04-11T20:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.25, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability of Israel expanding its ground invasion to the Gaza Strip before June 1, 2024, we need to consider several factors, including historical context, current tensions, and the strategic interests of the involved parties.

The most recent significant conflict occurred in May 2021, resulting in a ceasefire after 11 days of violence. However, tensions remain high, with periodic exchanges of fire and ongoing protests along the Gaza-Israel border. As of my last update, there has been no clear indication of an imminent large-scale ground invasion by Israel into the Gaza Strip.

Historical Frequency of Geomagnetic Storms: Geomagnetic storms with a Kp index greater than 4 but less than or equal to 5 are relatively common. They can occur multiple times during the solar cycle, especially during periods of high solar activity. However, predicting their exact timing and intensity can be challenging. 2. Solar Cycle Phase: The solar cycle, which is approximately 11 years, significantly influences the frequency and intensity of geomagnetic storms. The period around the solar cycle's peak (solar maximum) tends to have more frequent and intense geomagnetic activity. As of 2024, we are likely in or approaching the solar cycle 25 maximum, which could increase the likelihood of such storms. 3. Forecasting Capabilities: Short-term forecasting of geomagnetic storms has improved, thanks to better monitoring of solar activity and the solar wind. Organizations like the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) provide forecasts and warnings for geomagnetic storms. However, predicting the exact Kp value of an impending storm more than a few days in advance remains difficult. 4. Randomness and Variability: There is a degree of randomness and variability in solar activity and the resulting geomagnetic storms. Even during periods of high solar activity, not all solar flares and coronal mass ejections will result in significant geomagnetic storms. Considering these factors, while it is plausible that a geomagnetic storm with a Kp index greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 could occur between July 17 and July 28, 2024, the specific timing and intensity are subject to a significant degree of uncertainty.

Understanding the Question: The question asks whether the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 for each of COVID, influenza, and RSV will occur within four weeks of the combined peak for all three in the 2023-24 season. 2. Analyzing the Diseases: Each of these diseases (COVID, influenza, and RSV) has different patterns of spread and peak times. However, they often share a common period of heightened activity during the fall and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. 3. Previous Patterns: Historically, influenza and RSV tend to peak in the winter months, roughly between December and February, though this can vary by year. COVID-19, being a relatively new virus, has shown variability in its peak times but has also seen significant surges during the winter months, especially in its early years. 4. Combined Peak Consideration: The combined peak for all three diseases is likely to occur during the winter months, given their individual peak times. However, the exact timing can vary based on numerous factors including vaccination rates, public health measures, and the specific strains circulating. 5. Hospitalization Rates: The maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 for each disease is influenced by the severity of the circulating strains, the population's immunity (from vaccination or previous infection), and the effectiveness of public health measures. 6. Four-Week Window: The question specifies a four-week window from the combined peak for all three diseases. Given the variability in peak times and the factors influencing hospitalization rates, it's possible but not guaranteed that the maximum weekly rate for each disease will occur within this window. 7. CDC's RESP-NET Data: The resolution of this question relies on data from the CDC's RESP-NET, which tracks hospitalizations for these diseases. The data might show trends and peaks, but the exact timing within a four-week window is subject to the factors mentioned above. 8. Conclusion: Considering the variability in peak times and the factors influencing hospitalization rates, it's plausible that the maximum weekly rate for each disease could occur within four weeks of the combined peak, but it's not a certainty. The probability of this happening would depend on the synchronization of the peaks and the effectiveness of public health measures. Given these considerations, the probability that the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 for each of COVID, influenza, and RSV occurs within four weeks of the combined peak in the 2023-24 season is moderate to high, but not guaranteed."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "f52f8a1d-6392-4edf-8db2-1896789dfb0e", "title": "Will the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 in the US occur within five weeks of the combined peak for each of COVID, influenza, and RSV in the 2023-24 season?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 for each of COVID, influenza, and RSV that occurs in the 2023-24 season is less than or equal to five weeks (35 days) from the date of the maximum rate for all three combined, according to the CDC's [RESP-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/resp-net/dashboard.html).

Seasonality of the Diseases: All three diseases (COVID, influenza, and RSV) exhibit seasonal patterns. In the United States, influenza and RSV typically peak in the winter months, while COVID-19 has shown peaks in both winter and summer, depending on the variant and vaccination rates. However, the combined peak of these diseases is likely to occur during the winter months due to the overlapping seasonal patterns of influenza and RSV. 2. Hospitalization Rates and Reporting: The CDC's RESP-NET dashboard provides data on hospitalizations for these diseases, but there's a reporting delay, typically of about 4 weeks, to allow for data revisions and to account for reporting delays. This delay ensures that the data used for resolution is as accurate as possible. 3. Definition of the 2023-2024 Season: The question defines the 2023-2024 season as beginning with the week ending on October 7, 2023, and ending with the week ending on June 1, 2024. This timeframe captures the typical peak seasons for influenza and RSV and allows for the potential variability in COVID-19 peaks. 4. Five-Week Window: The question resolves as \"Yes\" if the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 for each disease occurs within five weeks (35 days) of the combined peak for all three diseases. Given the overlapping peaks of these diseases during the winter months, it's plausible that the individual peaks could occur within this timeframe, especially considering the reporting delays and the natural variability in disease spread. 5. Uncertainty Factors: Several factors could affect the timing and magnitude of disease peaks, including vaccination rates, the emergence of new variants, public health measures, and changes in human behavior. These uncertainties make it challenging to predict with absolute certainty when the peaks will occur. Considering these points, the most likely scenario is that the individual peaks for COVID, influenza, and RSV will occur relatively close to each other, given their overlapping seasonal patterns and the factors influencing disease spread. Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect that the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations for each disease could occur within five weeks of the combined peak."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Understanding the Seasonal Patterns of COVID, Influenza, and RSV: - COVID-19 has shown unpredictable peaks and troughs in hospitalization rates, influenced by factors like vaccination rates, new variants, and public health measures. - Influenza typically peaks in the winter months, but the exact timing can vary from year to year. - RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) also tends to peak in the late fall to early winter, but like influenza, the exact timing of its peak can vary. 2. Considering the Combined Peak: - The combined peak of all three (COVID, influenza, and RSV) would likely occur during the winter months when influenza and RSV are traditionally at their highest, and COVID could also surge due to increased indoor gatherings and travel. 3. Analyzing the Likelihood of the COVID Hospitalization Rate Peak Occurring Within Four Weeks of the Combined Peak: - Given that COVID's peaks have been less predictable and can be influenced by a wide range of factors (including new variants and vaccination rates), it's challenging to confidently predict its peak will align closely with influenza and RSV. - However, public health measures, increased awareness, and vaccination efforts might push the peaks of these diseases closer together as people take more precautions during known 'flu seasons.' 4. Accounting for Data Revisions and Reporting Delays: - The resolution criteria allowing for data revisions and reporting delays introduce a practical consideration, ensuring that the answer isn't based on incomplete or preliminary data. However, this does not directly influence the probability of the event occurring. Given these considerations, the probability that the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 for COVID occurs within four weeks of the combined peak for each of COVID, influenza, and RSV in the 2023-24 season is influenced by the unpredictable nature of COVID peaks and the traditional seasonal patterns of influenza and RSV. While there's a plausible argument for these peaks aligning due to seasonal factors and public health responses, the inherent unpredictability of COVID-19 surges introduces significant uncertainty. Therefore, while it's a reasonable hypothesis that these peaks could align within a four-week window due to overlapping seasonal factors and public health measures, the unpredictability of COVID surges makes it challenging to assign a high probability to this event."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0412608818727506, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0206304409363753, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28988551782622424, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Frequency of Public Appearances and Statements: As a public figure, JD Vance, who is an American author, venture capitalist, and politician serving as the junior United States senator for Ohio, regularly makes public appearances, gives interviews, and posts on social media. This increases the likelihood of him mentioning the word 'Couch' in a public setting. 2. Commonality of the Word 'Couch': 'Couch' is a common, everyday word that could easily come up in conversation, especially in discussions about home furnishings, relaxation, or even metaphorically in discussions about therapy or legislative 'couching' of terms. Its commonality makes it more likely to be mentioned. 3. The Broad Definition of a 'Mention': The market's rules define a 'mention' broadly, including verbal usage, written usage on social media, and other official communication channels. This broad definition increases the chances of a qualifying mention. 4. Time Frame: The time frame from July 25 to August 31, 2024, provides a substantial window for such a mention to occur, especially considering Vance's active role in public life and the likelihood of numerous public statements or appearances. 5. Randomness and Unpredictability: Despite the factors above, there is an inherent randomness to whether Vance will choose to use this specific word. Without specific context or patterns suggesting he frequently talks about couches, predicting with certainty is challenging.

To determine the likelihood of a break, let's consider the following factors: 1. Serialization schedule: Shonen Jump typically publishes chapters on a weekly basis, with some exceptions for holidays, special events, or creator breaks. Given that chapters 40 and 42 are consecutive, it's likely that chapter 41 will be published without a break, following the standard weekly schedule. 2. Creator's pace: The creator's pace and work schedule can influence the likelihood of breaks. However, without specific information about the creator's current workload, health, or other factors that might impact their ability to produce chapters, it's difficult to make an informed assessment. 3. Story progression: The story's progression and pacing can also influence the likelihood of breaks. If the story is in a critical or climactic phase, the creator might be less likely to take a break. However, without knowledge of the story's current state, it's challenging to make a prediction. 4. Leaker information: The question mentions that the resolution might be influenced by \"known-accurate leakers\" posting details about a break ahead of time. However, without concrete information from reliable sources, it's uncertain whether a break will occur.

Inflection's commitment to safety: Inflection, as a company involved in AI development, might have a vested interest in demonstrating the safety of their models, especially given the increasing public and regulatory scrutiny of AI safety. This interest could motivate them to conduct or commission safety assessments, including external red-teaming, to build trust and comply with potential regulatory requirements. 2. External red-teaming: Red-teaming is a practice where a team, often external to the organization, simulates adversarial attacks or scenarios to test the robustness and security of a system. In the context of AI, this would involve testing the model's safety against various inputs or scenarios designed to elicit harmful or undesirable outputs. External red-teaming can provide a more unbiased assessment of a model's safety compared to internal assessments. 3. Publishing a public report: For a company like Inflection, publishing a public report on the results of external red-teaming efforts would be a transparent way to demonstrate their commitment to safety. However, it also involves risks, such as revealing vulnerabilities in their models or attracting negative publicity if the results indicate significant safety concerns. 4. Timeline: The question specifies a deadline of June 30, 2025. Given the current pace of development in AI and the increasing emphasis on AI safety, it's plausible that Inflection could organize and publish the results of external red-teaming within this timeframe. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Inflection publishing a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2025, seems reasonable. The company has a clear incentive to demonstrate the safety of their models, and external red-teaming followed by a public report would be a credible way to do so. However, the exact probability depends on factors not publicly known, such as Inflection's internal priorities, the complexity of organizing such an effort, and their willingness to be transparent about the results."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Incumbent President's Incapacity or Resignation: The primary reason for Kamala Harris to assume the presidency before the specified date would be if the incumbent president, Joe Biden, were to become incapacitated or resign. Given President Biden's age and the demands of the office, health issues could be a concern. However, as of the last public information available, there's no indication of severe health issues that would lead to such a sudden transition. 2. Impeachment and Removal: Another, albeit highly unlikely, scenario would be the impeachment and removal of President Biden by Congress. Given the political landscape and the control of the Senate, this scenario is extremely improbable within the given timeframe. 3. Unexpected Events: There could be unforeseen circumstances leading to a sudden vacancy in the presidency, such as a severe health crisis or an accident. However, these are unpredictable by nature and difficult to assign a probability to. Given these considerations, the likelihood of Kamala Harris being formally designated as President or Acting President before July 26, 2024, seems low, primarily because there's no clear indication of President Biden's incapacity to continue in office or any imminent political action that would lead to his removal.
