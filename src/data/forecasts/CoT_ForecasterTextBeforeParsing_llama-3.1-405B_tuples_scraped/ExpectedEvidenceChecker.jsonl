However, his national profile and appeal within the broader Republican Party are not as pronounced as some other potential or declared candidates for the 2024 presidential nomination. The Republican Party has a wide array of potential candidates for the 2024 presidential election, including former President Donald Trump, who has already announced his candidacy, and other figures like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and possibly others who might enter the race. The competition for the nomination is expected to be fierce, with several candidates having strong national profiles and significant political and financial backing. Given these factors, while Larry Elder has a dedicated following and can influence conservative discourse, his path to becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election is challenging.

Then, it asks if Glenn Youngkin would also be selected as the nominee under the same conditions. 2. Logical Inconsistency: The primary issue with the scenario is that it assumes a situation that is logically inconsistent under typical conditions. In standard practice, a political party selects only one nominee for the presidential election. The notion of two individuals being selected as nominees contradicts this established norm. 3. Resolution Criteria: The question resolves as YES if Glenn Youngkin is selected alongside Larry Elder, despite the logical inconsistency. It resolves as NO if Glenn Youngkin is not selected. Given the logical inconsistency and the standard practice of political parties selecting a single nominee, the probability of the scenario occurring as described is extremely low. Political conventions and the nomination process are structured to culminate in the selection of a single candidate to represent the party in the election. The rules of the Republican National Convention and the broader electoral process in the United States do not accommodate the selection of dual nominees for the presidency from the same party.

Joe Biden's Age and Health: Joe Biden is currently 81 years old, which makes him one of the oldest presidents in U.S. history. His age and occasional health issues have led to speculation about his ability to serve another term as President. 2. Previous Statements and Intentions: Before and during his presidency, Joe Biden has expressed his intention to serve only two terms. However, he has not made any definitive statements about not accepting the nomination for the 2024 election cycle. 3. Democratic Party's Nomination Process: The Democratic Party's nomination process typically involves primaries and caucuses, followed by a national convention where the nominee is officially chosen. If Biden were to decide not to accept the nomination, it would likely be before the Democratic National Convention, which usually takes place in the summer. 4. Resolution Criteria: According to the resolution criteria, Biden or his campaign must make a definitive, public, and official announcement stating that he will not seek and will not accept the nomination for another term as President in the 2024 cycle. Considering these points, here's my reasoning: - While there have been concerns about Biden's age and health, he has shown no clear indication of stepping down or not accepting the nomination. - The Democratic Party's nomination process and the timing of the convention suggest that if Biden were to make such an announcement, it would likely be before the convention, but there is no guarantee. - The resolution criteria require a definitive and unambiguous statement, which has not been made yet.

Kamala Harris's Odds in Nate Silver's Model: The question posits a scenario where Kamala Harris's odds of winning do not increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model. This is a specific condition that suggests her chances of winning the presidency are stable or decreasing, which might imply her campaign or public perception isn't gaining significant momentum. 2. Joe Biden's Decision on the Democratic Nomination: The main query revolves around whether Joe Biden will announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President. This decision would be pivotal in the Democratic Party's selection process for a presidential candidate. 3. Connection Between Kamala Harris's Odds and Joe Biden's Decision: There's an implicit assumption that the stability or decrease in Kamala Harris's odds might have some bearing on Joe Biden's decision. However, it's crucial to recognize that Joe Biden's decision to run or not would likely be influenced by a wide array of factors beyond just the odds of another potential candidate. These could include his health, public opinion, the overall political climate, and strategic considerations within the Democratic Party. 4. Resolution Criteria: The question provides clear criteria for what constitutes an announcement by Joe Biden that he will not seek or accept the nomination. It must be definitive, public, and leave no room for ambiguity regarding his intentions. Given these considerations, the probability that Joe Biden announces he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024, under the condition that Kamala Harris's odds do not increase, is not directly correlated in a straightforward manner. Joe Biden's decision would likely be based on a comprehensive assessment of his own chances, the party's interests, and broader political dynamics, rather than solely on the performance of another candidate in predictive models. Therefore, without specific information linking Joe Biden's decision-making process directly to Kamala Harris's odds in Nate Silver's model, it's challenging to assert a high probability based on the condition given.

Firstly, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that no person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. Given this context, for Donald Trump to be removed or blocked from the ballot, there would need to be a determination that he has engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort to its enemies. This would likely require a legal or legislative process to establish such facts and make a determination. As of the current time, while there have been various investigations and discussions about Trump's actions, particularly in relation to the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, there has been no official determination under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment that would disqualify him from holding federal office. Considering the time frame until July 15, 2024, and the legal and political processes involved, it seems unlikely that such a determination would be made and result in Trump's removal or blocking from the primary election ballot in any state. However, given the unpredictability of political and legal developments, especially in the context of the United States' highly polarized environment, it's impossible to rule out entirely. Therefore, based on current information and understanding of the processes involved, I would estimate the probability of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as of July 15, 2024, as follows: Probability: 0.15. This probability reflects the low likelihood of such a significant legal and political development occurring within the specified time frame, while still acknowledging the inherent uncertainties and potential for unexpected events in the political landscape."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "fc491703-75ef-4d9c-ada2-51b023cfc083", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Current Political Standing: As of my last update, Nikki Haley has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, having served as the Governor of South Carolina and later as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations under President Donald Trump. Her political experience and national recognition are significant assets. 2. Potential Competitors: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 presidential election could be wide. Notable figures like Donald Trump (if he decides to run again), Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis, and others might also seek the nomination. The competition is likely to be fierce, with several candidates having strong bases of support within the party. 3. Historical Context: The Republican Party has shown a tendency to nominate candidates who are either the incumbent president or vice president, or those who have run previously and built a significant national profile. However, there are instances where less expected candidates have secured the nomination, often riding a wave of grassroots support or capitalizing on a unique political moment. 4.

As of my last update, I do not have real-time data on Nikki Haley's performance in these metrics compared to potential rivals. 5. Nikki Haley's Unique Position: Haley has navigated her relationship with Trump skillfully, maintaining a balance between criticizing certain actions (like the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack) and supporting the broader Republican agenda. This could position her as a viable alternative to both Trump loyalists and those seeking a new direction for the party.

Current Political Standing: As of my last update, Glenn Youngkin is known for winning the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021. This victory could be seen as an indicator of his potential for broader appeal within the Republican Party, especially considering he won in a state that has trended Democratic in recent years. 2. Potential Competitors: The field for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination is expected to be crowded, potentially including figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others who have higher national profiles than Youngkin. The presence of such candidates could make it challenging for Youngkin to stand out and gain the necessary support to become the nominee. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party's dynamics and what they might be looking for in a candidate can significantly influence the nomination process. After the 2020 election and the events that followed, the party's stance on issues like election integrity, economic policy, and social issues could play a crucial role in determining the kind of candidate they wish to nominate. Youngkin's ability to navigate these dynamics and present himself as a viable candidate on these fronts will be crucial. 4. Fundraising and Endorsements: Youngkin's ability to raise funds and secure key endorsements from within the party will also be significant factors. Candidates who can demonstrate strong fundraising capabilities and garner support from influential party members often have an advantage in the nomination process. Given these considerations, while Glenn Youngkin has shown potential with his gubernatorial win in Virginia, the field for the Republican nomination is likely to be highly competitive, with several candidates having more established national profiles and potentially stronger connections within the party.

As of my last update, Vivek Ramaswamy is known for being a young entrepreneur and author who has gained media attention for his views on capitalism, China, and critical race theory among other topics. However, in the context of the Republican nomination for the presidency, several factors work against his favor: 1. Establishment Candidates: Typically, Republican primaries favor candidates with more established political backgrounds, such as governors or senators. Vivek Ramaswamy lacks this traditional political experience, which often includes a network of support within the party and recognition among voters. 2. Competition: The field for the Republican nomination can be crowded, often including several well-known and well-funded candidates. Competition from more established political figures can make it difficult for a less conventional candidate to gain traction. 3. Funding: While Ramaswamy has personal wealth, which could be an advantage in a political campaign, competing at the national level requires enormous resources. Candidates with broader political support often have access to more substantial fundraising mechanisms. 4. Recognition and Support: To succeed, Ramaswamy would need to significantly increase his national recognition and favorability ratings among Republican voters. This often requires a combination of grassroots organizing, successful debate performances, and strategic media appearances. 5. Party Dynamics: The dynamics within the Republican Party, including the influence of former President Donald Trump and the balance between conservative and moderate elements, can also impact Ramaswamy's prospects. His ability to appeal to a broad spectrum within the party would be crucial. Given these considerations, the likelihood of Vivek Ramaswamy securing the Republican nomination for the 2024 US Presidential Election appears low. While unexpected outcomes can occur in politics, the factors mentioned suggest that he faces significant hurdles in achieving this goal."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "276d2d3e-b352-400a-9fe9-889cff62ea5e", "title": "Will Mike Pence be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Mike Pence is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, certain figures like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis have been more prominently mentioned or have already begun campaigning. 2.

He ran for the Republican nomination in 2016 but dropped out early in the process. Since then, his influence and popularity within the party have waxed and waned, particularly due to his criticisms of Donald Trump. 3. Popularity and Fundraising Ability: Christie's popularity among the broader Republican base has diminished since his governorship, partly due to his stance on Trump. His ability to fundraise and build a strong campaign infrastructure is uncertain, given the current political climate and the presence of more favored candidates. 4. Primary Election Dynamics: The Republican primaries are a complex process, with outcomes influenced by numerous factors, including state-level politics, debate performances, and media coverage. Christie would need to outperform in several early states to gain momentum. 5. Convention Dynamics: The question specifically mentions selection by the Republican National Convention, which introduces the possibility of a brokered convention if no candidate secures a majority of delegates before the convention. However, Christie would still need significant delegate support to be considered. Given these considerations, while it's impossible to rule out any possibility entirely in politics, Chris Christie's path to the nomination appears fraught with challenges.

While he has gained national attention for his leadership and policies, particularly among Republicans and independents, his national profile is not as high as some other potential or declared candidates for the Republican nomination. 2. Competitive Landscape: The field for the Republican nomination is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile figures potentially running, including former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and other well-known politicians. The competition for the nomination will be intense, and Suarez will face significant challenges in raising his profile, securing funding, and building a national campaign infrastructure. 3. Selection Process: The Republican National Convention's selection process involves delegates from each state voting on the nominee. This process can be complex, with multiple rounds of voting possible if no candidate secures a majority in the initial round. Suarez would need to perform well in primary elections and caucuses to secure a substantial number of delegates.

Political Experience and Popularity: Donald Trump Jr. has been involved in politics, particularly in his father's campaigns and presidency. He has built a reputation among some Republicans for his conservative views and his ability to connect with the base. However, his lack of direct political office experience could be seen as a drawback compared to other potential candidates. 2. Family Ties: Being the son of former President Donald Trump could be both an advantage and a disadvantage. On one hand, it gives him immediate name recognition and possibly a strong base of support among his father's fans. On the other hand, it could lead to accusations of nepotism and may alienate those within the party looking for a fresh start or a different direction. 3. Potential Competition: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could be crowded, with several experienced politicians and newcomers vying for the spot. Figures like Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, and Nikki Haley have been mentioned as potential candidates. The competition will be fierce, and Donald Trump Jr. would need to differentiate himself and win over a broad base of support within the party. 4. Current Political Landscape: The Republican Party is at a crossroads, trying to navigate its post-Trump era identity. Some factions within the party are looking to move beyond Trumpism, while others are deeply loyal to the former president and his brand of politics. Donald Trump Jr.'s success would depend on his ability to navigate these internal dynamics. Given these considerations, while Donald Trump Jr. has a certain level of popularity and name recognition, the competition for the Republican nomination is expected to be intense.

Analysis: - Donald Trump's Influence: Donald Trump has a significant influence within the Republican Party, as evidenced by his successful nomination in 2016 and his continued popularity among a substantial segment of the party's base. However, the condition assumes he is not the nominee, which could be due to various reasons such as a decision not to run, a loss in the primaries, or a decision by the party to move in a different direction. - Donald Trump Jr.'s Profile: Donald Trump Jr. has been involved in politics, particularly in supporting his father's campaigns and presidency. However, his own political career and appeal as a candidate are less established compared to his father. While he has a following, it's uncertain whether he has the broad appeal and political machinery necessary to secure the Republican nomination. - Party Dynamics: The Republican Party's dynamics and the field of potential candidates for the 2024 election will significantly influence the outcome. Other prominent Republicans, including those with more established political careers and potentially broader appeal, might be more likely to secure the nomination. 4. Conclusion: Given the condition that Donald Trump is not the nominee, the likelihood of Donald Trump Jr. being selected seems low. The Republican Party might opt for a candidate with a more established political track record or broader appeal within the party and to the general electorate.

His presidency from 2017 to 2021 was marked by significant controversy but also maintained a high level of support among Republican voters. 2. **Current Political Climate**: The political landscape in the United States remains highly polarized. Trump's base within the Republican Party is strong, and he has maintained a high level of influence over the party's direction. However, his controversial actions and statements have also led to significant opposition, both within and outside the party. 3. **Potential Opponents**: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 nomination is wide, including figures like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence. While Trump has a strong base, some of these candidates might appeal to a broader range of voters or offer alternative visions for the party that could challenge Trump's dominance. 4. **Nomination Process**: The Republican nomination process, culminating in the Republican National Convention, involves a series of primaries and caucuses across the states. This process tests a candidate's popularity, organizational strength, and financial resources. Trump has demonstrated an ability to excel in this process in the past.

Current Political Standing: Chris Christie, a former Governor of New Jersey, has been involved in national politics for many years, including a previous run for the presidency in 2016. However, his popularity and influence within the Republican Party have waxed and waned, particularly following his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal and his criticism of then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016. Lately, Christie has attempted to position himself as a more moderate voice within the party, which could appeal to some but also alienate him from the more conservative or Trump-aligned factions. 2. Competitive Landscape: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates either declared or rumored to be considering a run. This includes former President Donald Trump, who maintains a significant base of support within the party, as well as other notable figures like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence. In such a competitive environment, Christie would need to carve out a distinct niche for himself and garner substantial support to stand out. 3. Selection Process: The Republican National Convention's process for selecting a nominee involves delegates chosen by each state, typically through primaries or caucuses. This means that success in the nomination process is heavily dependent on performing well in these early contests, building momentum, and securing a substantial number of delegates. Christie's path to the nomination would require him to perform exceptionally well in these contests, which, given the competition, is a challenging task. Considering these factors, while Chris Christie has a certain level of name recognition and political experience, the competitive nature of the Republican field and the dynamics of the nomination process make his path to becoming the nominee quite challenging."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "0222fa71-d999-4ef2-87c8-a1ac01fce064", "title": "If Chris Christie is the Republican nominee, will Vivek Ramaswamy also be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where Chris Christie is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update in 2023, the Republican field for the 2024 presidential election is wide open, with several potential candidates expressing interest or already having declared their candidacy. The popularity and chances of each candidate can fluctuate significantly based on various factors, including their campaign performance, public debates, and how they manage to build their supporter base.\n\n2. Vivek Ramaswamy's Recognition and Popularity: Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and author, has gained some attention for his candidacy but is generally considered a long-shot candidate compared to more established political figures within the Republican Party. His appeal to a specific segment of Republican voters might be strong, but his overall recognition and broad-based support within the party are limited compared to other contenders.\n\n3. Nomination Process Dynamics: The Republican National Convention's nomination process is complex and can be influenced by numerous factors, including delegate counts from primaries and caucuses, the strategic maneuvering of candidates, and the preferences of party leaders. A candidate like Vivek Ramaswamy would need to either win a significant number of delegates through the primary process or emerge as a compromise candidate in a contested convention, both of which are challenging scenarios for someone not currently at the forefront of the party's leadership or lacking broad national recognition.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it's not impossible for Vivek Ramaswamy to secure the nomination, especially in a highly unpredictable and potentially crowded field, the likelihood of him doing so is relatively low compared to more established figures within the party.

Historical Context and Pence's Profile: Mike Pence, having served as Vice President under Donald Trump from 2017 to 2021, has a significant profile within the Republican Party. His conservative credentials, experience in government, and relatively stable public image could be advantageous. 2. Current Political Landscape: As of the last available information in 2023, the Republican field for the 2024 election is still forming. Potential candidates include Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, and possibly others like Ron DeSantis. The landscape is competitive, and Pence would need to carve out his own niche to succeed. 3. Fundraising and Support: A successful nomination campaign requires substantial funding and broad support from party officials, donors, and the base. Pence has connections to both establishment Republicans and some segments of the evangelical right, but his fundraising prowess compared to other contenders, especially Trump, is untested. 4. Pence vs. Trump: The dynamics between Pence and his former boss are complex. While Pence was a loyal vice president, his decision not to overturn the 2020 election results as Trump had hoped created tension. Trump's influence over the party base could impact Pence's chances, especially if Trump decides to run. 5. Party Direction: The Republican Party is at a crossroads, grappling with its post-Trump identity. Pence represents a more traditional conservative wing of the party, which may or may not align with where the base wants to go in 2024.

First, let's establish that winning a gold medal is a subset of winning any medal. Therefore, if fewer than 5 countries win their first-ever gold medal, it's still possible for more countries to win their first-ever medal of any kind (including silver or bronze). Historically, the number of countries winning their first-ever Olympic medal of any kind has been higher than those winning their first gold medal. This is because the pool of potential medal winners is larger when considering all types of medals. Given the condition that fewer than 5 countries win their first-ever Olympic gold medal, we can infer that the number of countries winning their first-ever medal of any kind could still be substantial. This is because countries that do not win a gold medal could still win a silver or bronze medal, contributing to the total count of countries winning their first-ever Olympic medal.

The first part of the question is about a market condition that needs to be met by July 15, 2023. This condition is specific to the performance or state of a particular market and does not directly relate to OpenAI or the availability of ChatGPT in the EU. The details provided about the market's resolution criteria (having at least 377 traders before market close on July 15) suggest that this is an independent event from the general availability of ChatGPT in the EU. The second part of the question concerns the availability of ChatGPT in the EU by June 30, 2024. This involves regulatory compliance, business decisions by OpenAI, and the technical capability to provide the service within the EU. Factors influencing this could include data protection laws (like GDPR), the EU's regulatory stance on AI, and OpenAI's strategic plans for expansion. There is no direct causal relationship between the linked market achieving a certain number of traders and the availability of ChatGPT in the EU. The first is a market performance metric unrelated to AI or technology service availability, while the second involves regulatory, business, and technological considerations specific to AI services. Given the lack of a direct relationship between the two events and the specificity of each condition, predicting the availability of ChatGPT in the EU based on the market condition does not logically follow. However, since the question does not provide specific insights into OpenAI's plans or regulatory hurdles that might affect the availability of ChatGPT in the EU, we must rely on general knowledge about the expansion of technology services into new markets. Typically, such services aim for wide availability, but regulatory and compliance issues can cause delays. Given the lack of direct causality and the absence of specific information about OpenAI's plans or EU regulatory hurdles, the probability estimate for ChatGPT being generally available in the EU by June 30, 2024, based on the condition provided, cannot be confidently tied to the market condition. Therefore, the estimate should reflect a general uncertainty about the expansion of AI services into new regulatory environments. Probability: 0.5. This probability reflects the lack of direct connection between the market condition and the service's availability, as well as the uncertainty inherent in predicting regulatory compliance and business expansion decisions.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Approval as Presidential Candidate: Ahmadinejad's approval as a candidate could potentially increase tensions between Iran and Israel due to his past rhetoric and policies, particularly his stance on Israel and his administration's alleged support for militant groups. However, it's crucial to note that Ahmadinejad's influence and power within Iran have diminished since his presidency ended, and the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei holds the ultimate authority over Iran's foreign policy and military actions. 2. Israel's Security Concerns: Israel views Iran as a significant security threat, especially concerning Iran's nuclear program and its support for militant groups in the region. Israel has shown a willingness to carry out military operations within Iran to address these concerns, such as targeting nuclear facilities or military installations. 3. Recent Developments and Tensions: The region has seen heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, with reports of clandestine operations and cyberattacks. However, the decision to carry out a deadly attack within Iran would depend on a variety of factors including the perceived threat level, international diplomatic considerations, and the potential for escalation. 4. Timeframe: The question specifies a timeframe before May 1, 2024, which is relatively short. This means that for the question to resolve yes, there would need to be a significant escalation or a specific event that prompts Israel to take such action within a limited time frame. Given these considerations, while there is a potential for increased tensions with Ahmadinejad's candidacy, the probability of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, depends on a complex interplay of factors including Iran's actions, the perceived threat level, and international diplomatic considerations.

OpenAI's Commitment to Transparency and Safety: OpenAI has consistently emphasized its commitment to the safe and responsible development of AI. This includes being transparent about the capabilities and limitations of their models. Given this commitment, it's reasonable to expect that they would engage in and publish the results of external red-teaming exercises to improve their models' safety. 2. Industry Trends and Best Practices: The AI industry is moving towards more transparent and collaborative approaches to AI safety. External red-teaming is recognized as a valuable practice for identifying vulnerabilities and improving the robustness of AI systems. By following this trend, OpenAI would align with industry best practices and contribute to the broader goal of ensuring AI safety. 3. Regulatory and Public Pressure: There is increasing regulatory and public interest in the safety and accountability of AI systems. Governments and civil society are calling for more transparency and independent oversight of AI development. In response to this pressure, OpenAI may see the publication of external red-teaming results as a way to demonstrate accountability and compliance with emerging regulatory expectations. 4. Technical and Logistical Challenges: Conducting meaningful external red-teaming requires significant resources and planning. It involves finding suitable external parties with the necessary expertise, ensuring they have access to the necessary information and systems, and integrating their findings into actionable improvements. Despite OpenAI's resources, these challenges could potentially delay such efforts. 5. Competitive Considerations: The AI industry is highly competitive, and companies might be hesitant to share information that could be perceived as revealing vulnerabilities in their technology. However, OpenAI's stated mission and values suggest that they prioritize the advancement of safe AI over competitive secrecy. Considering these factors, it seems likely that OpenAI would engage in and publish the results of external red-teaming of their models for safety. Their commitment to transparency and safety, along with industry trends and external pressures, supports the expectation that they would undertake such efforts. While there are challenges and potential hesitations, OpenAI's values and public stance on AI safety suggest they would proceed with publishing a report by June 30, 2024."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "69d4025e-41b6-4167-a3c2-29e2e71039c7", "title": "Will Anthropic publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, Anthropic publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T05:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.7, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To answer this question, let's consider the context and available information step by step: 1. Anthropic's Focus on AI Safety: Anthropic is a company known for its focus on developing AI models with a strong emphasis on safety. Given this focus, it's reasonable to assume that they would be open to and possibly even eager to conduct or facilitate external red-teaming exercises to test the safety of their models. Red-teaming, in this context, refers to the practice of simulating an adversary's attack on one's own systems or models to identify vulnerabilities. 2. Industry Trends and Best Practices: The AI industry, especially the segment focused on developing advanced models like those at Anthropic, is increasingly recognizing the importance of external audits and red-teaming as a best practice. This is partly due to the growing awareness of the potential risks associated with advanced AI systems. Companies like Anthropic are likely to follow or even set such best practices. 3. Public Transparency and Accountability: Companies in the AI sector, particularly those working on potentially impactful technologies, are under increasing pressure to be transparent about their safety measures and findings. Publishing the results of external red-teaming efforts would be a way for Anthropic to demonstrate transparency and accountability, potentially enhancing their reputation and trust among stakeholders. 4. Timeline and Feasibility: The deadline given is June 30, 2024. Considering the current pace of development in the AI industry and the emphasis on safety, it's plausible that Anthropic could organize and publish the results of an external red-teaming exercise within the given timeframe. 5. Potential Challenges: Despite the points above, there could be challenges or reasons why Anthropic might not publish such a report by the deadline. These could include unforeseen technical challenges, changes in priorities, or concerns about how the report might be received by the public or competitors.

Joe Biden Announces He Will Not Accept the Democratic Nomination: The first condition is that Joe Biden must announce he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024. This is a significant political event that would likely have substantial implications for the Democratic Party and the 2024 presidential election. If Biden, the incumbent president, decides not to run, it would open up the field for other Democratic candidates and potentially alter the dynamics of the election. 2. Impact on Polling: The announcement would likely lead to immediate changes in polling numbers as the electorate and poll respondents adjust their perceptions and preferences based on the new information. The Democratic Party would need to quickly coalesce around a new candidate, and the dynamics between this new candidate and Donald Trump would become the focus of the election. 3. Donald Trump's Lead Over Joe Biden: Since the question specifically asks about Trump's lead over Biden according to 538's national polling average on July 15, 2024, and given that Biden has announced he won't run, the relevance of polling numbers between Trump and Biden becomes somewhat moot. However, the question seems to aim at understanding the immediate impact of such an announcement on the polling dynamics. 4. Polling Average Range: The question specifies a lead greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3. This is a narrow margin, indicating a close race. However, given the scenario where Biden steps down, it's plausible to expect some volatility in the polls as respondents adjust to the news. Reasoning: Given the scenario's specifics and the inherent unpredictability of political polling, especially in response to significant events like a major candidate dropping out, predicting the exact margin of Trump's lead over Biden in such a narrow range becomes highly speculative. The immediate aftermath of Biden's announcement not to run would likely see fluctuations in polling numbers as the political landscape adjusts.

Historical Context and Precedents: It's rare for an incumbent president to decline their party's nomination for a second term, especially without significant external pressures or health issues. This historical context suggests a low baseline probability for such an event. 2. Joe Biden's Health and Age: As of my last update, Joe Biden is in his early 80s, making him one of the oldest serving U.S. presidents. While age and health could be factors in a decision not to run, Biden and his team have consistently signaled his intention to run for re-election. Without clear evidence of deteriorating health impacting his ability to serve, this factor alone does not significantly increase the likelihood of him not accepting the nomination. 3. Political and Economic Climate: The decision to run for re-election can be influenced by the current political and economic climate. However, unless there is a drastic change in Biden's popularity or a significant economic downturn directly attributed to his policies, it's unlikely that he would decline the nomination based solely on these factors. 4. Public Statements and Intentions: As of my last update, Joe Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election. While political intentions can change, a complete reversal without a significant intervening event is uncommon. 5. Timing and Party Dynamics: The Democratic Party's nomination process and the broader political landscape would also influence such a decision. Declining the nomination could significantly impact the party's chances in the election and would likely be a decision made with considerable input from party leaders. There has been no public indication of such discussions leaning towards Biden not accepting the nomination. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President before July 15, 2024, appears low. Without significant and unforeseen changes in his health, the political landscape, or economic conditions directly linked to his presidency, it is reasonable to estimate a low probability for this event."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6520da8a-818c-449b-b777-be84551409ec", "title": "Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?", "body": "Resolves **Yes** if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\n\n - Donald Trump\n - Donald Trump Jr.\n - Eric Trump\n - Ivanka Trump\n - Tiffany Trump\n - Melania Trump\n - Barron Trump", "resolution_date": "2024-07-15T22:20:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2020-05-09T10:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability of a member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, let's consider several factors: 1. Donald Trump's Influence and Popularity: As of my last update, Donald Trump remains a significant figure in the Republican Party, with a substantial base of supporters. His influence over the party and his popularity among certain segments of the electorate cannot be underestimated. This suggests a higher likelihood of him or a family member gaining the nomination. 2. Potential Candidates: The list of potential candidates from the Trump family is extensive, including Donald Trump himself, his children (Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany, and Barron), and his wife Melania. However, the likelihood varies significantly among them, with Donald Trump being the most probable. 3. Previous Political Experience and Engagement: Donald Trump has already been the Republican nominee and President, giving him a significant advantage in terms of name recognition and political experience. His children, particularly Donald Jr. and Ivanka, have also been involved in politics to varying degrees, though their experience is significantly less than their father's. 4. Party Dynamics and Primaries: The dynamics within the Republican Party and the outcomes of primary elections can be unpredictable. Other strong candidates could emerge, and the party's mood could shift away from Trump's brand of politics. However, as of my last update, the Trump family enjoys considerable support within the party. 5. Legal and Health Considerations: Any legal issues or health concerns affecting Donald Trump could potentially impact his ability to run or the party's willingness to nominate him. However, without specific information on these fronts, it's difficult to adjust the probability significantly based on these factors.

Their best result was in 1994 when they finished second. Understanding their historical performance can provide a baseline for expectations. 2.

Without knowing the specifics at this point, it's challenging to assess this factor accurately. 3. Competition: The level of competition in Eurovision is high, with many countries sending talented artists with strong songs. The competition in the semi-finals, from which countries qualify for the Grand Final, is particularly fierce. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical and cultural factors, with countries often voting for their neighbors or countries with similar cultural backgrounds. Poland might benefit from votes from other European countries, especially those with Polish diaspora communities. 5. EBU Rules and Changes: The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) might introduce rule changes or modifications to the voting system, which could affect qualification chances.

Latvia has qualified for the Grand Final a few times since the semi-final system was introduced in 2004, including a win in 2002. Poland has also qualified several times but has not won since 1994. However, past performance is not always a strong indicator of future success due to changes in musical trends, voting patterns, and competition rules. 2. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical and cultural alliances. Latvia might benefit from votes from other Baltic countries and potentially other Eastern European nations. Poland, being a larger country in Eastern Europe, might also benefit from regional support, but the extent of this can vary greatly from year to year. 3. Song and Performance Quality: The quality of the song and the performance are crucial factors. A catchy, well-performed song can significantly increase a country's chances of qualifying, regardless of its geographical location. This factor is highly variable and difficult to predict without knowing the specific entries for 2024. 4. Competition in the Semi-finals: The number and quality of competitors in the specific semi-final that Poland is assigned to will also affect its chances. A semi-final with many strong contenders could make it harder for Poland to stand out and qualify. Given these factors, the assumption that Latvia qualifies does not directly impact Poland's chances, as each country's qualification is determined independently in the semi-finals. However, if we consider indirect implications, such as a possible strong Baltic or Eastern European presence in the competition, it might suggest a favorable climate for countries from these regions, potentially benefiting Poland. Nonetheless, the outcome largely depends on the variables mentioned above, which are specific to each edition of the contest. Without specific information about the entries for Eurovision 2024, the safest approach is to rely on general statistics and trends.

Given the balance of power in the House and Senate, the possibility of a successful impeachment leading to removal from office within the specified timeframe appears slim. 4. 25th Amendment Invocation: The 25th Amendment allows the President to transfer power temporarily or permanently to the Vice President if they are unable to discharge their duties.

However, it also faces challenges due to regional voting patterns, particularly the significant influence of Western European countries' votes in the contest. 4.

Political Performance and Reception: Harris's performance and public reception since taking office in 2021 have been mixed. While she has her supporters, she has also faced criticism on various fronts, including her handling of immigration issues and her role in the Senate. However, it's crucial to note that VP candidates are often chosen for reasons beyond just popularity, including strategic considerations like electoral college calculations and party unity. 3. Potential Alternatives: The Democratic Party has a deep bench of potential VP candidates, including but not limited to other cabinet members, senators, and governors. The decision to choose an alternative candidate could be influenced by factors like regional politics, ideological balance, or an attempt to energize specific segments of the Democratic base. 4. President Biden's Preferences and Strategy: Ultimately, the choice of VP candidate heavily depends on President Biden's personal preferences, strategic considerations for the 2024 election, and internal party dynamics. If Biden decides to run for re-election, he might stick with Harris for continuity and to avoid internal party conflicts that could arise from choosing a new running mate. 5. Resolution Criteria: The market resolves based on the initial nomination, meaning any subsequent changes to the VP choice after the nomination will not affect the resolution. Given these considerations, and assuming President Biden seeks re-election, the likelihood of Kamala Harris being nominated again as the Democratic VP candidate is relatively high due to her incumbency and the general tendency for sitting presidents to maintain their vice-presidential picks for re-election campaigns.

The field for the 2024 election is expected to be competitive, with high-profile candidates like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis.

Firstly, the condition that Kamala Harris is not the Democratic VP nominee is crucial. If she is not selected, it could imply a variety of scenarios, including but not limited to Biden choosing a different running mate for strategic reasons or due to Harris declining the nomination. However, this condition alone doesn't directly influence Biden's decision to accept or decline the Democratic nomination for President.\n\nThe core of the question revolves around Joe Biden's intentions and announcements regarding his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election. For the question to resolve as YES, Biden must make a clear, public, and unambiguous statement about not seeking or accepting the nomination before July 15, 2024. \n\nHistorically, incumbents who have chosen not to run for re-election have made their announcements at various times, but often with significant notice to allow for party primaries and strategic adjustments. Given the timing specified in the question, we're looking at a scenario where Biden would be making a relatively late decision in the election cycle, considering the Democratic National Convention is usually held in late July or early August.\n\nThere are a few scenarios to consider:\n1. Biden's Health and Age: Concerns about Biden's age and health could potentially lead to a decision not to run, but as of my last update, there was no clear indication that he intended to step down due to these factors.\n2. Political Strategy: If the Democratic Party feels that Biden is not the strongest candidate, there could be internal pressure for him to step down. However, such a move would be unprecedented and highly unlikely given Biden's status as the incumbent.\n3. Unexpected Events: Any unforeseen event that could dramatically alter the political landscape, making it untenable for Biden to continue his candidacy.\n\nGiven these considerations, and without specific evidence or indications that Biden intends to make such an announcement, it's reasonable to conclude that the likelihood of him announcing he will not accept the nomination before the specified date is low.

Resignation: Voluntary resignation of a U.S. President is extremely rare (with Nixon being the only example in modern history). There has been no indication from Biden or his administration that he intends to resign. 4. Temporary Transfer of Power: The question specifies that a temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment does not constitute a resolution of \"NO\". This means our focus is on permanent changes, not temporary delegations of authority. Considering these factors, the likelihood of President Biden not remaining President through the end of July 2024 due to resignation, death, or removal from office seems low.

The EU has been known to impose tariffs and duties on imports to protect its domestic industries, especially in sectors considered strategic or sensitive, such as the automotive industry. Given the growing importance of electric vehicles (EVs) and the EU's ambitions to become a leader in EV production and adoption, there might be a motivation to protect the domestic EV market. Relations between the EU and China have been complex, with areas of cooperation but also significant competition and tension, particularly concerning trade and technology. The EU has expressed concerns about China's trade practices, intellectual property issues, and the impact of Chinese subsidies on the global market. These tensions could contribute to a decision to impose tariffs or duties on Chinese imports, including EVs. The European economy has faced challenges, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, and supply chain disruptions. Protecting domestic industries through tariffs could be seen as a way to support economic recovery and resilience. However, such measures could also lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses, potentially exacerbating inflation and economic challenges. The EU has set ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and become carbon neutral. Electric vehicles play a crucial role in these plans. While the EU might want to support its domestic EV industry, it also needs to balance this goal with the need for rapid decarbonization, which might require importing EVs to meet demand. Given these considerations, while there is a rationale for why the EU might impose tariffs or duties on Chinese electric vehicles (to protect its domestic industry and due to geopolitical tensions), there are also reasons why it might not (the need for a rapid transition to electric vehicles and potential economic downsides of tariffs).

First, let's consider the condition: 'no group of at least 5 named Dem House Members or US Senators pressuring Biden to drop out before July 20th.' The information provided indicates that there is already some level of discontent among Democrats with Biden's candidacy, as evidenced by two safe-seat members publicly urging him to drop out and reports of multiple drafts of letters circulating among House Democrats that would call on Biden to end his campaign. However, for the condition to be violated (and thus for the question to potentially resolve YES), a specific threshold of at least five named individuals working together to ask Biden to drop out must be reached. Given the existing discontent, it seems plausible that this threshold could be met, but it's not a certainty, especially considering the requirement for the effort to be made public with qualifying names before the deadline. Next, let's consider the outcome: 'the EU announce new tariffs on Chinese EVs before July 5, 2024.' This part of the question pertains to international trade policy and the dynamics between the European Union and China. The EU has been known to impose tariffs and take measures to protect its market and industries, especially in sectors like electric vehicles, which are considered strategic for future economic growth and environmental policy goals. The decision to impose new tariffs would depend on a variety of factors, including negotiations with China, the current state of trade relations, and internal EU policy discussions. Without specific information on ongoing discussions or plans regarding tariffs on Chinese EVs, it's challenging to predict this outcome with high certainty. Given these considerations, the probability of the question resolving YES (meaning no group of at least five named Democratic Party US House Members/US Senators work together to ask Joe Biden to drop out before July 20th, AND the EU announces new tariffs on Chinese EVs before July 5, 2024) involves combining the probabilities of two relatively independent events. For the condition (no pressure on Biden), given the current political climate and the specific threshold required, let's estimate a probability of around 0.6 that no such group of five or more named individuals will publicly urge Biden to drop out before July 20th. For the outcome (EU announcing new tariffs), without specific details on trade negotiations and policy discussions, we might estimate a probability of around 0.4 that the EU would announce new tariffs on Chinese EVs before July 5, 2024, considering the general context of trade relations and the strategic importance of the EV sector. Combining these probabilities (assuming independence of the events) gives us a joint probability of 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3122082549695574, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The question essentially asks whether the specificity of the candidate (Joe Biden) as opposed to a generic label (Democrat) influences voting behavior among these respondents in a way that benefits Donald Trump by at least 3%. 1. Public Opinion Polls Context: It's mentioned that public opinion polls show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, but other Democrats hypothetically surveyed poll ahead or within the margin of error. This suggests a specific disadvantage for Biden in the broader public opinion. 2. Manifold Respondents Representation: The question of whether Manifold respondents are representative of the general public is crucial. If they are, we might expect their voting behavior to mirror the broader public opinion trends, potentially indicating a disadvantage for Biden compared to a generic Democrat. 3. Candidate Specificity Impact: Research in political science has shown that the specificity of a candidate can impact voting decisions. A generic label (e.g., Democrat) might allow respondents to project their ideal candidate onto that label, potentially leading to higher support. Conversely, a specific candidate (e.g., Joe Biden) comes with known policies, personality, and baggage, which might deter some voters. 4. Resolution Formula: The formula to determine the percentage of votes for Trump considers not just the votes for Trump and the Democrat but also accounts for 'Someone else.' This means that the decision to vote for Trump over a Democrat (be it Biden or a generic one) also competes with the option to choose neither. Given these considerations, if Manifold respondents reflect broader public opinion trends and if the specificity of Joe Biden as a candidate (compared to a generic Democrat) has a similar or more pronounced effect among these respondents, it's plausible that Trump could gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat.

Understanding the Groups Involved: - Greens\u2013EFA: The Greens/European Free Alliance is a political group in the European Parliament that brings together representatives from green parties and parties that advocate for stateless nations and minority groups. - GUE/NGL: The European United Left/Nordic Green Left is another political group in the European Parliament, primarily composed of left-wing parties, including communist, socialist, and eco-socialist parties. 2. Analyzing Past Performance and Trends: - Historically, the European Parliament's composition reflects a diverse political spectrum. The two groups in question, Greens\u2013EFA and GUE/NGL, have traditionally held a smaller number of seats compared to the major groups like the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S&D). - However, recent years have seen a rise in popularity for green and left-wing parties in various European countries, partly due to increased awareness of environmental issues and economic inequality. 3. Considering the Conditions for a 'Yes' Resolution: - For this question to resolve as 'Yes,' both Greens\u2013EFA and GUE/NGL must hold the most seats in the European Parliament after the 2024 elections, either individually or tied. - Given the diverse and multi-party nature of the European Parliament, achieving a scenario where these two groups simultaneously hold the most seats is challenging. It would require a significant shift in voting patterns across Europe, favoring these groups uniformly over the traditional larger groups. 4. Assessing the Likelihood: - While there is a growing trend towards environmentalism and left-wing policies, the European Parliament's electoral landscape is highly fragmented. The possibility of both Greens\u2013EFA and GUE/NGL surpassing the traditionally dominant groups simultaneously is low. - Factors such as campaign strategies, key policy issues, and voter turnout can influence election outcomes. However, the scale of change required for both these groups to emerge as the largest is substantial and unlikely. Given these considerations, the probability that both Greens\u2013EFA and GUE/NGL will hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections is low.

To make an informed prediction, let's consider several factors: 1. Historical Context and Precedent: It's rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election campaign, especially this close to their party's convention and the general election. Such a move would be unprecedented and could significantly impact the party's chances of retaining the presidency. 2. Health and Age Concerns: As of my last update, President Biden is one of the oldest individuals to serve as President of the United States. His age and any potential health issues could be factors that might lead to speculation about his ability to continue in the race. However, without specific, credible information about his health deteriorating to the point of incapacitation, it's speculative to assume he would drop out for these reasons. 3. Political Strategy and Party Support: The decision to drop out would also depend on the political landscape, including his standing in the polls, the strength of his potential opponents, and the overall strategy of the Democratic Party. As of my last update, there was no widespread indication from the Democratic Party or Biden's campaign that he was considering dropping out. 4. Time Frame: The resolution date of July 20, 2024, is critical. This date is close to the Democratic National Convention, where the party's nominee is officially selected. Dropping out before this event would necessitate a rapid adjustment in the party's strategy and nominee selection process.

Biden Dropping Out Before July 20: The actual question concerns whether, given the selection of either Kelly or Shapiro, President Biden would drop out or be unable to continue the race before July 20, midnight Eastern Time. Reasoning: - Selection of Kelly or Shapiro: Since the market favorites are Kelly and Shapiro, let's assume there's a higher probability (though unspecified) that one of them will be chosen. This selection, however, does not directly impact Biden's decision to stay in the race unless their selection somehow dramatically alters the political landscape in a way that hasn't been commonly discussed or anticipated. - Biden Dropping Out: The reasons for a sitting president to drop out of a re-election campaign are typically severe (health issues, scandal, party pressure due to low performance, etc.). As of the information available up to the creation of this market (July 8, 2024), there hasn't been widespread credible reporting or indicators suggesting that President Biden is facing issues severe enough to force him out of the race, especially by a specific and near deadline like July 20. Given these points, the likelihood of President Biden dropping out before July 20, contingent on Kamala Harris selecting Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro as her running mate, seems low.

The first event is Kamala Harris choosing a running mate other than Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro. The second event is, given that the first event occurs, Joe Biden dropping out or being unable to continue the race before July 20, midnight Eastern Time.\n\n1. **Kamala Harris' Running Mate Choice**: The question implies that Kelly and Shapiro are favorites, but it does not provide specific probabilities. The choice of running mate is often influenced by a variety of factors including political strategy, personal chemistry, and the potential to attract voters in key demographics or regions. Without explicit probabilities or more detailed information on Harris' preferences or the political calculus involved, we can only speculate on the likelihood of choosing someone other than Kelly or Shapiro. However, given they are described as favorites, it might be slightly less likely that she chooses someone else, but not significantly so, as political decisions can be highly unpredictable.\n\n2. **Biden Dropping Out**: The likelihood of Joe Biden dropping out or being unable to continue the race before a specific date is difficult to estimate without current health information or knowledge of any potential scandals or political maneuvers that could lead to such an outcome. Historically, once a candidate has secured a nomination, it is rare for them to drop out unless faced with extraordinary circumstances (health issues, scandal, etc.). Given the high stakes of a presidential election and the usual rigorous scrutiny candidates face before securing a nomination, the probability of such an event is generally low.\n\nConsidering these points, the probability that both events occur (Harris picks someone other than Kelly or Shapiro, and then Biden drops out before July 20) involves multiplying the probabilities of each event happening. Without precise numbers for the first event and considering the second event's probability as low based on historical context, the combined probability is likely to be quite low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given this historical context, it is reasonable to expect debates to occur in the 2024 cycle as well. 2. Declared Candidates and Potential Entrants: As of the last update, several notable Democrats have either declared their candidacy or are rumored to be considering a run. The presence of multiple candidates often leads to debates as a way for the party to ensure that all voices are heard and that the eventual nominee is well-vetted. 3. Party Strategy: The Democratic Party has an interest in hosting debates as a means of energizing the base, drawing media attention, and allowing for a thorough examination of each candidate's qualifications and policy proposals. Debates can also help in identifying the most viable candidate for the general election. 4. Primary and Caucus Schedule: The timing and scheduling of state primaries and caucuses might influence the likelihood of debates. If several key states have early primaries or caucuses, candidates may push for debates to reach these voters before they head to the polls. 5. Current Political Climate: The political climate in 2024, including issues of national concern and the perceived strength of the incumbent (if running) or the opposing party's candidates, can influence the Democratic Party's strategy regarding debates.

Historical Context: It's essential to look at past Olympic Games to understand the frequency of countries winning their first gold medal. Over the years, as more countries participate and the number of events increases, the likelihood of new countries winning gold also increases. However, the number of debut gold medals can vary significantly from one Olympics to another. 2. New Events and Sports: The inclusion of new sports and events in the Olympic program can significantly increase the chances of countries winning their first gold medal. For example, the addition of surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing, and karate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics provided opportunities for countries that are strong in these sports to win their first gold. 3. Participation and Competition Level: The level of competition and the number of participating countries in each sport can also affect the outcome. Sports with a high level of competition and a large number of participating countries might see fewer debut gold medals, as established Olympic powers often dominate these events. 4. Emerging Sporting Nations: Some countries have been investing heavily in sports infrastructure and talent development, increasing their chances of winning their first Olympic gold. Identifying these emerging sporting nations can help estimate the likelihood of new gold medal winners. 5. Randomness and Upsets: The Olympics are known for their unpredictability. Upsets can happen in any sport, and sometimes, athletes from less favored countries can win gold, contributing to the count of debut gold medals. Considering these factors, while there's a trend of new countries winning their first gold medals, especially with the introduction of new sports and the rise of emerging sporting nations, predicting the exact number is challenging.

Historical Context: Looking at past Olympic Games, it's common for a few countries to win their first Olympic medals at each edition. This is due to a variety of factors such as improvements in training, new sports or events being added, and political or economic changes in countries that might affect their Olympic participation and performance. 2. New Sports and Events: The Olympic Games have been evolving by adding new sports and events, which gives more opportunities for smaller or less Olympic-successful countries to compete in areas they might have strengths. For the 2024 Paris Olympics, new sports like surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing, and breakdancing are included. These sports might offer fresh opportunities for countries that have not traditionally excelled in Olympic staples like track and field or swimming. 3. Globalization of Sports: The globalization of sports and increased accessibility of training facilities and coaching expertise have leveled the playing field somewhat, allowing athletes from more countries to compete at a higher level. 4. Statistical Basis: Without specific data from recent Olympics on first-time medal winners, a precise statistical model is challenging to construct. However, given the trends mentioned, it's reasonable to assume that there will be some countries achieving this milestone. 5. Paris 2024 Specifics: Considering the addition of new sports and the ongoing globalization of athletic talent, it seems plausible that the 2024 Games could see a higher number of first-time medal-winning countries compared to previous editions.

First, let's consider the condition: fewer than 5 countries winning their first-ever Olympic medal. This is a significant piece of information because it sets a cap on the number of new medal-winning countries. For a country to win its first-ever Olympic gold medal, it must first win its first-ever Olympic medal. Therefore, the pool of potential countries winning their first gold medal is limited by the condition to fewer than 5 countries. Given this condition, for the outcome of at least 5 countries winning their first-ever Olympic gold medal to occur, it would require that almost all (if not all) of the countries winning their first-ever Olympic medals also win gold. This is because the condition restricts the total number of new medal-winning countries to fewer than 5. However, winning a gold medal is generally more challenging than winning any medal. The competition for gold is fierce, and it often requires not just excellence but also a bit of luck and specific circumstances to align in the competitor's favor. Considering the above points, the probability that all or the majority of the fewer than 5 countries winning their first-ever Olympic medals would also win gold medals is low. This is because the condition sets a narrow window for new medal-winning countries, and within that window, achieving the highest honor (a gold medal) is statistically less probable than winning any medal.

Understanding Eurovision Qualification: In the Eurovision Song Contest, countries that are not part of the 'Big Five' (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) must qualify for the Grand Final through two semi-finals. The top 10 countries from each semi-final, as voted by a combination of jury and public votes, qualify for the Grand Final. 2. Azerbaijan and Lithuania's Participation and History: Both Azerbaijan and Lithuania have been regular participants in the Eurovision Song Contest. Azerbaijan has had a relatively successful history, including a win in 2011, and has qualified for the Grand Final several times. Lithuania's success has been more variable but has also qualified for the Grand Final on several occasions. 3. Conditional Probability: The question asks for the probability that Lithuania will qualify for the Grand Final given that Azerbaijan qualifies. This is a conditional probability, which means we are only interested in the scenarios where Azerbaijan successfully qualifies. 4. Factors Influencing Qualification: Several factors can influence a country's qualification, including the quality of the song, the performance, the voting patterns (both jury and public), and the competition in the specific semi-final. 5. Analysis: Given that Azerbaijan qualifies, we can infer that their song and performance were strong enough to appeal to voters. However, Lithuania's qualification is independent of Azerbaijan's in terms of performance and voting, except for the fact that they might be competing against different sets of countries in the semi-finals. 6. Recent Trends: Without knowing the specific entries for 2024, we can look at recent trends. Both countries have shown the ability to qualify, but it's a highly competitive contest where many factors, including song quality, staging, and voting blocs, play significant roles. 7.

The Role of Unofficial Confirmations: The question specifies that an unofficial confirmation would suffice. This means that the media outlet doesn't necessarily need to wait for an official statement from Joe Biden or his campaign. Rumors, leaks, or confirmations from credible sources within the campaign or administration could prompt a reputable news outlet to run the story. 4.

Overall, I estimate a moderate probability that Israel will carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, particularly considering the volatile nature of the region."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.355609771134772, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.088902442783693, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 1.0276594897883449, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historically, the Netherlands has had a mixed record in Eurovision. After a string of non-qualifications from 2005 to 2012, the country saw a resurgence in success, culminating in Duncan Laurence's win with 'Arcade' in 2019. This victory marked the Netherlands' first Eurovision win since 1975. However, success in one year does not guarantee qualification in the next, as tastes, trends, and competition dynamics change annually. The Eurovision Song Contest is known for its unpredictability, with outcomes influenced by a complex mix of factors including song quality, performance, staging, and political or cultural voting patterns. The introduction of the semi-final format in 2004 and the 50/50 jury-televote system in 2009 have aimed to make the contest more inclusive and fair, but also more unpredictable. Given the information available up to April 2024, without knowing the specific entry for the Netherlands or the entries of competing countries, we must rely on general trends and the country's recent performance. The Netherlands has shown an ability to produce competitive entries in recent years, but the competition is fierce, and qualification is never guaranteed.

This experience could be beneficial in another presidential nomination bid. 2.

Potential Competitors: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could be crowded, with potential candidates including Donald Trump (if he decides to run again), Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others. The competition will be fierce, and Cruz will need to distinguish himself significantly to secure the nomination. 4.

Joe Biden's Age and Health: As of my last update, Joe Biden is the oldest serving U.S. President. His age and any potential health issues could influence his decision to run for a second term. However, as of now, there hasn't been any significant public concern regarding his health that would necessitate an early announcement of not running. 2. Political Climate and Approval Ratings: The decision to run for re-election can be heavily influenced by a president's approval ratings and the overall political climate. Presidents with high approval ratings are more likely to seek re-election. Biden's approval ratings have fluctuated but considering the polarized nature of U.S. politics, his ratings might not be the sole determinant of his decision. 3. Economic Conditions: The state of the economy is a crucial factor for any incumbent president considering re-election. Economic downturns can discourage re-election bids, while strong economic conditions can encourage them. The U.S. economy, like the global economy, faces challenges, but it has also shown resilience. 4. Democratic Party Dynamics: The dynamics within the Democratic Party, including the presence of potential challengers and the party's overall stance on key issues, can influence Biden's decision. However, as of now, there hasn't been a significant challenge to his leadership within the party that would suggest he wouldn't seek re-election. 5. Personal and Strategic Timing: The timing of such announcements can be strategic, taking into account the political landscape, the party's primaries schedule, and the need to give potential successors ample time to campaign. An early announcement of not running could be seen as a way to give the party time to rally around another candidate, but it's not common for incumbent presidents to make such early announcements without strong reasons. Given these considerations, there hasn't been a clear indication from Joe Biden or his campaign that he intends to step down or not accept the nomination.

However, it's crucial to note that Joe Biden's decision regarding his nomination acceptance has little to no direct influence on the Republican Party's choice of nominee. The Republican Party's selection process is independent of the Democratic Party's actions or decisions. 1. Primary Elections and Republican Party Dynamics: The selection of a presidential nominee is largely determined by the outcomes of primary elections and caucuses, as well as by party conventions in some cases. The popularity of the candidate among the party's base, their fundraising capabilities, and their performance in debates and other public forums play significant roles. 2. Ted Cruz's Standing in the Party: Ted Cruz has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, known for his conservative stance and his ability to galvanize a segment of the party's base. However, his standing within the party, particularly after his 2016 presidential campaign and his complex relationship with former President Donald Trump, is a factor that could influence his chances. 3. Potential Competition: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 presidential election could be crowded, including possibly Donald Trump himself, which would significantly impact Cruz's chances. Other potential candidates might have stronger fundraising capabilities, broader appeal within the party, or more substantial national recognition. 4. Convention Dynamics: In the event that no candidate secures the nomination through the primary process, the dynamics of the Republican National Convention, including delegate negotiations and potential alliances, would come into play. Given these considerations, the probability of Ted Cruz being selected as the Republican nominee is difficult to estimate with high precision, especially without knowing the specific candidates who will run or the outcomes of primary elections. However, considering Cruz's past performance and the potential for a crowded field of candidates, it's reasonable to estimate his chances as relatively low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.01582766399036388, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical Volatility and Trends: Understanding the historical volatility of the BSE SENSEX, especially in the period leading up to July 2024, is crucial. If the index has shown a trend of steady growth or stability around the 75,000 mark, the likelihood of it falling within the specified range increases. 2. Market Sentiment and Economic Indicators: Market sentiment, along with economic indicators such as inflation rates, interest rates, and GDP growth, can significantly influence the direction of the stock market. Positive sentiment and favorable economic indicators could push the index upwards, while negative sentiment or poor indicators might depress it. 3. Global Economic Conditions: The global economic landscape, including the performance of major economies and any significant geopolitical events, can also impact the Indian stock market. Positive global conditions could support the growth of the BSE SENSEX. 4. Company Performance and Earnings: The performance of key companies listed on the BSE SENSEX, especially their quarterly earnings reports around the time of the prediction, can also influence the index's value. Strong earnings could boost the index, while weak earnings might drag it down. Given the complexity and variability of these factors, predicting the exact range of the BSE SENSEX with certainty is challenging. However, assuming that there are no drastic changes in market conditions, economic indicators remain stable or improve, and global economic conditions are favorable, the index could potentially continue on a path of growth or stability. Considering these factors and without access to real-time data or specific trends up to July 2024, a moderate to somewhat optimistic stance seems reasonable. Therefore, the probability that the closing value of the BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024, will be greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 76,000 could be estimated as follows: Probability: 0.35.

This section allows the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or another relevant body) to declare the President unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, making the Vice President the Acting President. Several factors suggest that this event is unlikely: 1. Historical Precedent: The 25th Amendment has been invoked a few times since its ratification in 1967, but Section 4 specifically has never been used. This lack of precedent suggests a high threshold for its invocation. 2. Political Considerations: Invoking Section 4 would be a highly controversial and politically charged decision, likely to face significant opposition and public scrutiny. The political costs for those involved in such a decision could be substantial, making it a less likely course of action. 3. Medical and Personal Factors: For Section 4 to be invoked, there would need to be clear evidence that President Biden is unable to perform his duties. While President Biden's health has been a subject of public discussion, there has been no indication from medical professionals or his administration that he is incapable of discharging his duties. 4.

This is a political event rather than an economic one, but it could have economic implications depending on the policies pursued by the Acting President and the market's reaction to the change in leadership. The change in leadership, even if temporary, could lead to shifts in economic policy or at least perceptions of potential shifts. However, given the short timeframe (before August 2024) and the fact that any significant policy changes would likely face substantial delays due to the legislative process, the immediate economic impact might be limited. Market reactions could be more immediate but are unpredictable and might not directly influence the Core CPI in a significant way within a month. The Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices of a basket of goods and services, excluding food and energy. The determinants of Core CPI are broad and varied, including supply and demand dynamics, wages, production costs, and monetary policy, among others. For the Core CPI to increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024 compared to June 2024, there would need to be a noticeable increase in these underlying costs or demand. The key challenge is linking the invocation of the 25th Amendment directly to an increase in Core CPI. Economic policies that could influence the CPI, such as monetary policy changes or fiscal stimulus, are not directly tied to the change in presidential leadership in the short term. Given the indirect and uncertain relationship between the invocation of the 25th Amendment and the immediate economic indicators like the Core CPI, it's challenging to establish a clear causal link that would lead to a more than 0.1% increase in the Core CPI for July 2024 based solely on President Biden being declared incapacitated."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "15dfa3d1-9ce9-4d2f-9381-05ad64383335", "title": "Given Biden is not declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August, will the Month-over-Month US Core CPI increase by more than 0.1% in July?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) do not invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time).\n\nThe duration of the incapacity does not matter for this condition.

The number of traders in a market about the number of traders in that market does not directly influence political decisions such as the choice of a vice-presidential running mate.

The pool of potential candidates can be vast, including but not limited to politicians with various backgrounds and from different states. Given that Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are among the many potential candidates, without specific information that they are favored over others, it's challenging to assign a high probability to them being chosen specifically. However, it's also important to note that both Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are notable figures within the Democratic Party, which might make them plausible candidates for the position. Shapiro, in particular, has gained national attention, which could make him a viable choice, while Kelly's background and current position as a senator could also make him a contender.

Companies in the AI sector are increasingly expected to demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI development, which includes being open about their models' vulnerabilities and the steps taken to address them. The process of external red-teaming involves hiring outside experts to attempt to find vulnerabilities in a company's AI models. This is a proactive approach to safety that can significantly bolster public trust and demonstrate a serious commitment to safety. Given the benefits of such exercises, it's plausible that Inflection would engage in this practice. The decision to publish the results of external red-teaming exercises publicly is a significant one. It indicates a high level of transparency and confidence in the company's ability to address identified vulnerabilities. While there's a risk that publishing vulnerabilities could be perceived negatively, the trend in the tech industry leans towards greater transparency as a means of building trust with stakeholders, including the public and regulatory bodies.

First, let's consider the relationship between the VXVCLS and presidential polling averages. The VXVCLS measures the market's expectation of 3-month volatility in the S&P 500. High volatility can be associated with economic uncertainty, which might influence voter preferences. However, the direct link between market volatility and the specific margin between two candidates in a national polling average is not straightforward. Economic indicators can influence elections, but their impact on the specific lead of one candidate over another within a narrow margin is more nuanced and subject to numerous other factors, including political campaigns, public debates, and unforeseen events. Second, the polling average itself, as reported by 538, aggregates various polls to provide a snapshot of the election race. The margin between candidates can fluctuate based on numerous factors beyond economic indicators, including political strategies, public appearances, and external events. Given the complexity of factors influencing both the VXVCLS and the polling averages, establishing a direct causal relationship between increased market volatility and a specific lead margin in the polls is challenging. While economic conditions can influence voter sentiment, predicting a precise outcome in polling margins based on market volatility indices is not straightforward. Therefore, considering the indirect relationship between market volatility and specific polling margins, along with the inherent unpredictability of political races, the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points specifically because the VXVCLS is higher year-over-year seems relatively low, given the multitude of factors that can influence polling averages."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "6669d763-c875-40c9-b02c-1c3f426dce99", "title": "Given the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index is the same or lower Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024, will Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) is the same or lower Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024.

CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) Condition: The question posits a scenario where the VXVCLS on July 20, 2024, is the same or lower than it was on July 20, 2023. The VXVCLS measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 over the next three months. Lower volatility can indicate a more stable market, which might reflect a positive economic outlook. 2. Trump's Lead Over Biden According to 538's National Polling Average: The question asks whether, given the volatility condition, Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden will be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 percentage points on July 15, 2024, based on 538's national polling average. Reasoning: - Economic Performance and Presidential Approval: There's a historical correlation between economic performance and presidential approval ratings. A stable or improving economy (which might be inferred from lower volatility) can boost the incumbent's or the incumbent party's chances. However, this is a general trend and not a hard rule. - Polling Averages and Their Predictive Value: Polling averages, like those from 538, aggregate data from multiple polls to provide a snapshot of the electoral landscape. They are generally more reliable than individual polls but are subject to their own set of biases and uncertainties. - The Specific Lead Margin: Predicting a specific lead margin (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 percentage points) is challenging. Polling averages can fluctuate significantly over short periods due to various factors, including but not limited to economic indicators, political events, and campaign strategies. - Timing and External Factors: The resolution date (July 15, 2024) is close to the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), but in the realm of political polling, a week can be a long time. External factors such as significant news events, debates, or campaign gaffes can influence polling numbers rapidly. Given these considerations, the relationship between the VXVCLS and Trump's lead over Biden is indirect and influenced by numerous factors. While a stable economic outlook (as might be inferred from lower volatility) could theoretically benefit Trump, predicting a specific polling margin with precision is extremely challenging due to the inherent volatility of polling data and the multitude of factors that can influence it. Probability: 0.25 This probability reflects the complexity and uncertainty of linking economic volatility directly to specific polling outcomes, especially within a narrow margin. It acknowledges the possibility without suggesting a strong likelihood."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.22625003318169679, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.056562508295424196, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.8139049198553298, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Market Trends and Fan Expectations: - The success of superhero movies has generally been on the rise over the past decade, with many fans eagerly anticipating crossovers and team-up movies. - The combination of Deadpool's humor and Wolverine's intensity could attract a broad audience, potentially exceeding the individual openings of the two precursor films. 3. Cinematic Universe Impact: - The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has shown immense success with combined character movies (e.g., Avengers). Although Deadpool & Wolverine is not directly part of the MCU, it could benefit from a similar 'team-up' appeal. - The integration of these characters into a single film might draw in fans curious about how their dynamics play out on screen. 4. Resolution Criteria: - The question resolves as 'Yes' if the domestic box office opening for Deadpool & Wolverine exceeds $185,548,391, the combined openings of Deadpool and The Wolverine. Given these considerations, the merging of Deadpool and Wolverine into a single film has the potential to attract a large audience, combining fans of both characters and possibly exceeding the individual box office openings of the precursor films. The trend of successful superhero movies, especially those featuring team-ups or crossovers, supports the likelihood of a strong opening. However, predicting box office success involves many variables, including marketing efforts, competition at the time of release, and audience reception to the film's content. Despite these uncertainties, the potential for a large opening is substantial given the popularity of the characters involved."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "36e325ac-3cf7-4175-be4a-bceb03ee1393", "title": "Conditional on \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" having a higher domestic box office opening than \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine\" combined, will Taylor Swift cameo in the movie?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is higher than $185,548,391, which is the combined opening of \"Deadpool\" (2016) and \"The Wolverine\" (2013).

Condition regarding Donald Trump: The question specifies a condition that as of July 15, 2024, Donald Trump must not have been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This condition is about Trump's eligibility to run for office and is unrelated to the market performance of Nvidia or Apple. It's a political condition that could potentially influence the market indirectly but doesn't have a direct correlation with the market capitalization of the mentioned companies. 2. Market Capitalization Comparison: The core of the question is whether Nvidia's market capitalization will be larger than Apple's on July 17, 2024. This is a straightforward comparison but involves predicting the future market performance of both companies. Reasoning for the Market Capitalization Comparison: - Nvidia's Growth: Nvidia has been experiencing significant growth, especially in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), graphics processing units (GPUs), and high-performance computing. The demand for its products in AI applications, gaming, and professional visualization has been strong. - Apple's Stability and Innovation: Apple is known for its stable ecosystem, brand loyalty, and continuous innovation in consumer electronics. Its market capitalization is one of the largest in the world, reflecting its consistent performance and the market's confidence in the company. - Market Trends and External Factors: The technology sector is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in trends, consumer preferences, and technological advancements. External factors such as global economic conditions, trade policies, and regulatory changes can also impact the market capitalization of these companies. Conclusion: Given the condition about Donald Trump is more of a backdrop and does not directly influence the market capitalization comparison, the focus should be on the market trends and the performance of Nvidia and Apple. Nvidia's strong growth in emerging technologies like AI and its dominant position in the GPU market are significant factors. However, Apple's market capitalization is substantial, and the company has a history of innovation and maintaining its market position. Without specific data on the companies' financials, products in development, and market conditions as of July 2024, making a precise prediction is challenging. However, considering Nvidia's growth trajectory and the increasing importance of AI and GPU technology, it's plausible that Nvidia could continue to grow significantly. Yet, surpassing Apple's market capitalization by July 17, 2024, is ambitious and would require not only Nvidia's continued success but also a relative decline or stagnation in Apple's market value. Probability: Given the current trends and the information available, I would estimate the probability of Nvidia's market capitalization being larger than Apple's on July 17, 2024, as 0.25. This reflects the potential for Nvidia's continued growth and the uncertainty in market trends, but also acknowledges Apple's strong position and the significant gap Nvidia would need to close to surpass Apple's market capitalization."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1011314159054832, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The outcome: Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average. Given the information provided, there's no direct causal relationship established between the number of traders in the linked market and the polling averages of Trump vs. Biden. Polling averages are influenced by a wide array of factors including but not limited to political events, public opinion shifts, campaign strategies, and external factors like economic conditions or global events. The condition of the linked market achieving a certain number of traders might be an attempt to gauge interest or liquidity in a prediction market related to the election, but it doesn't directly influence the outcome of the polling averages. Therefore, we must consider the probability of Trump's lead falling within the specified range independently of the market condition, assuming the condition is met. Historically, polling averages have shown variability, and predicting a specific range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4) requires a detailed understanding of the current political landscape, trends, and any events that might influence public opinion up to July 15, 2024. However, without access to real-time data, trends, or specific events that could sway the polls in the specified timeframe, we must rely on general knowledge of how polls can fluctuate. Polls can be volatile, and a range of 2 to 4 points is relatively narrow. Given the general nature of polls and without specific data indicating a stable trend within this range, it's challenging to assign a high probability to such a precise outcome. However, it's also not an impossible scenario, especially if the race is competitive and if there are factors at play that could slightly favor Trump without giving him a significant lead. Considering these factors, a moderate approach seems reasonable.

Historical Performance: Malta has participated in Eurovision numerous times and has a mixed record of qualifying for the Grand Final. Since the introduction of the semi-final format in 2004, Malta has qualified for the Grand Final about half the time. This suggests a baseline probability, but recent trends and specific entry qualities can significantly influence outcomes. 2. Song and Artist Quality: The quality and appeal of the song and artist selected by Malta for Eurovision 2024 are crucial. A catchy, well-performed song that resonates with a broad audience and the professional juries can significantly increase the chances of qualification. Information about the selected entry, if available, would be pivotal in assessing its potential to qualify. 3. Competition: The overall quality and diversity of entries in the semi-final Malta is participating in will also impact its chances. A semi-final with several strong entries could make qualification more challenging, whereas a weaker field could improve Malta's odds. 4. Voting Dynamics: Eurovision voting can be influenced by various factors, including geographical and cultural alliances, the order of performance, and the effectiveness of each country's promotional efforts. Malta might benefit from or be hindered by these dynamics, depending on how they play out in 2024. 5. Recent Trends: Recent years have shown a slight shift in voting patterns and preferences, with some countries experiencing a resurgence in success and others facing a decline. If Malta has been on an upward trend or has made efforts to improve its entries and promotional strategies, this could positively affect its chances. Given the lack of specific information about Malta's entry for Eurovision 2024, its performance in recent years, and the entries it will compete against, we must rely on historical data and general trends. Assuming Malta continues to invest effort into its Eurovision participation and considering the unpredictable nature of the contest, a cautious optimism might be warranted. However, without detailed insights into the 2024 entry and competition landscape, it's challenging to provide a highly confident estimate.

Historically, Malta has had a mixed record in qualifying for the Grand Final. Since the introduction of the semi-final format in 2004, Malta has qualified for the Grand Final several times but has also failed to qualify in a number of instances. Cyprus has also had its share of successes and failures, though it has been somewhat consistent in recent years, especially with the participation of Eleni Foureira in 2018, who came close to winning. Eurovision voting can be influenced by a variety of factors including geographical alliances, diaspora voting, and the quality of the song. Malta and Cyprus, both being island nations in the Mediterranean, might share some voting patterns, but they also compete for votes from the same regions. The assumption that Cyprus not qualifying would automatically benefit Malta doesn't necessarily hold, as voting preferences can be highly unpredictable and influenced by the specific entries and performances each year. The Eurovision Song Contest is highly competitive, with around 40 countries participating annually. The qualification of one country over another can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including the quality of the song, the performance, the staging, and the overall appeal to both the jury and the public. Assuming Cyprus doesn't qualify doesn't provide direct insight into Malta's chances without considering the overall quality of Malta's entry and performance in relation to the competition. Given these considerations, the probability of Malta qualifying for the Grand Final if Cyprus does not is not directly correlated. Malta's qualification would depend more on the strength of its own entry, performance, and how it is received by voters, rather than on the qualification status of Cyprus. Therefore, without specific information about the entries, performances, and other participating countries, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

Since the introduction of professional players in the Olympics in 1992, the U.S. men's team has won gold in every Olympics except for 2004, when they took bronze. The women's team has been even more successful, winning gold in every Olympics since 1992. However, the landscape of international basketball has changed, with many countries now fielding teams that include NBA and WNBA players, thereby significantly increasing the level of competition. Despite this, the U.S. has a deep pool of talent and a strong organizational structure, which includes a robust training program and the ability to attract top professional players. The men's team has shown vulnerability in recent international competitions, such as the FIBA World Cup, where they did not win gold in 2019. However, the Olympics tend to draw a more complete and focused U.S. squad compared to the World Cup. The women's team has been more consistent in maintaining its dominance, but the gap between the U.S. and other top teams has narrowed.

Understanding the Condition: The condition pertains to the US Department of Commerce's agreement with Verisign regarding the management of the .com generic top-level domain (TLD). The US government's decision to end this agreement would likely be based on considerations related to internet governance, national security, or the management practices of Verisign. This decision seems unrelated to Joe Biden's political career or his decision to run for president. 2. Understanding the Outcome: The outcome involves a specific political decision by Joe Biden regarding his potential candidacy for the Democratic Party's nomination for President in the 2024 election cycle. Such a decision would typically be influenced by personal, political, health-related, or strategic considerations rather than by administrative decisions related to internet governance. 3. Analyzing the Connection: There is no apparent direct connection between the US government's decision regarding the management of the .com domain and Joe Biden's decision on whether to seek or accept the Democratic nomination for President. These are two distinct areas of governance and personal decision-making that do not logically or causally influence each other in a straightforward manner. 4. Reasoning: Given the lack of a direct or even indirect significant connection between the condition and the outcome, it's reasonable to conclude that the occurrence of the condition (ending the agreement with Verisign) would not have a notable impact on the outcome (Joe Biden's decision regarding the Democratic nomination). Therefore, the probability of Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the nomination because of the condition specified seems extremely low. 5. Probability Estimate: Based on the analysis above, the probability that Joe Biden announces by July 15, 2024, he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President, conditional on the US government ending its agreement with Verisign by August 3, 2024, is very low.

The required increase is significant but not extremely high, considering the timeframe of approximately 1.5 months from the creation date to the resolution date. 2. Timeframe for Growth: The market has about 1.5 months to attract 78 more traders. This is a reasonable timeframe for organic growth, especially if the market is actively promoted or gains visibility through various means. 3. Visibility and Promotion: The mention of 'some market shenanigans' and the creation of this market suggest an effort to increase visibility and engagement. If the creator or others involved continue to promote the market, it could significantly boost the trader count. 4. Organic Growth vs. Directed Effort: Markets on platforms like Manifold can grow organically as users discover them through browsing or searching. However, directed efforts such as sharing the market link in relevant communities, forums, or social media can drastically increase visibility and participation. 5. Interest in the Market Topic: The topic or purpose of the embedded market isn't specified, but the interest it generates can significantly affect its ability to attract traders.

France's Performance: The condition that France does not place in the top 5 could imply a scenario where traditional powerhouses in the Olympics, such as the United States, China, Great Britain, and others, perform exceptionally well, potentially leading to a higher number of world records being broken as these countries often have athletes competing at the highest levels. 3.

Historical Performance: Norway has a mixed record in Eurovision. While they have won the contest three times (1985, 1995, and 2009), they have also had years where they did not qualify for the final. However, in recent years, Norway has shown a relatively consistent performance, often qualifying for the final. 2. Semi-final Format: The Eurovision semi-finals are divided into two nights, with each participating country (except the Big Five: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) performing in one of them. The top 10 countries from each semi-final, as voted by the public and juries, qualify for the Grand Final. This format means that Norway will compete against roughly half of the total participating countries in their semi-final, increasing their chances of qualification. 3. Song and Artist Selection: Norway's selection process for Eurovision often involves a national final called Melodi Grand Prix, where both the song and the artist are chosen. The quality and appeal of the selected song and artist play a significant role in Norway's chances of qualifying. While this information is not provided, Norway has a good track record of selecting competitive entries. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical, cultural, and political factors. Norway might benefit from neighborly votes, especially from other Nordic countries. However, the impact of such voting patterns is somewhat mitigated by the semi-final format and the use of a mixed voting system (50% jury, 50% public vote). 5. Competition: The overall quality of entries in Eurovision can vary significantly from year to year. Without knowing the specifics of the 2024 entries, it's challenging to assess how Norway's entry will compare. However, given Norway's recent performances and the professional approach to selecting their entry, it's reasonable to assume they will be competitive.

In recent years, their performance has been less consistent, but they have shown an ability to qualify for the final on several occasions. 2. Semi-final Format: The Eurovision semi-finals are divided into two nights, with each participating country (except the Big Five: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) performing once. A mix of jury and public voting determines the top 10 countries from each semi-final that advance to the Grand Final. This format means that Switzerland will compete directly against a subset of countries, not the entire field, which can influence their chances based on the specific competition and voting patterns. 3. Song and Artist Quality: A crucial factor in a country's success is the quality and appeal of their song and the performing artist. As of the last information available, the details about Switzerland's entry for Eurovision 2024 are not provided. The popularity and quality of the entry can significantly affect voting outcomes. 4. Voting Alliances and Patterns: Eurovision voting often reflects geographical and cultural alliances. Switzerland, being a country with multiple official languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh), might benefit from votes from countries sharing these languages or cultural ties. However, the impact of these alliances can vary from year to year. 5. Recent Trends: In recent years, Switzerland has shown a resurgence in the contest, qualifying for the final in 2019 and 2021. This could indicate a positive trend in their ability to produce and select competitive entries.

Considering Past Performances: While past performances can give some insight, they are not a reliable predictor of future outcomes in Eurovision, as the contest is highly variable from year to year. Both Switzerland and Norway have had mixed results in the past, but this does not provide a clear indication of their potential performance in 2024. 4.

However, these factors are complex and do not provide a straightforward way to predict outcomes based on another country's qualification. 5. Independence of Events: Ultimately, the qualification of Norway is independent of Switzerland's qualification. Each country's performance is evaluated separately, and the success of one does not impact the chances of the other.

However, as of my last update, Chasiv Yar has been a contested area, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces vying for control. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map provides a reliable source of information on the ground situation, and as of my last update, it indicated that the area was not under clear Russian control. Given the nature of the conflict, it's difficult to predict with certainty what the situation will be like in June 2024.

Understanding Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This section, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that no person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. Application to Donald Trump: The application of this clause to Donald Trump hinges on whether his actions on January 6, 2021, and possibly other events, are considered as having given 'aid or comfort' to an insurrection. There have been ongoing debates and legal discussions about this, but as of my last update, no official state government or court has made a definitive ruling that would apply Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to him in a way that results in his removal or blocking from a primary election ballot. Legal Process and Timing: For Trump to be removed or blocked from a primary election ballot under this clause, there would need to be a legal process initiated and concluded by July 15, 2024. Given the typical pace of legal proceedings and the potential for appeals, it's challenging to predict whether such a process could be completed within this timeframe. State Actions and Variability: The decision to remove or block Trump from a ballot would likely vary by state, depending on the specific laws, the political makeup of the state, and the outcomes of any legal challenges. This variability adds to the uncertainty of the situation. Conclusion: Considering the complexities of applying Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to Donald Trump, the variability in state laws and political climates, and the time required for legal processes, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether he will be removed or blocked from any state's primary election ballot by July 15, 2024. Given these considerations, while there is a possibility that efforts could be made to remove or block Trump under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the uncertainty and complexity of the situation suggest that the likelihood of such an outcome being officially confirmed and implemented by the specified date is relatively low."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "a0c9488d-9300-47c6-9dee-230af89cbfa4", "title": "If Donald Trump is removed from the primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, will Russia control Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as of July 15, 2024.

Firstly, the question specifies that as of July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has not been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This information is crucial for the conditionality of the question but does not directly influence the outcome regarding Russia's control of Chasiv Yar. Secondly, and more directly relevant to the resolution of the question, is whether the ISW map shows the specified coordinates (48\u00b035'13.7\"N 37\u00b050'02.1\"E) as under Russian control on June 1, 2024. The categories indicating Russian control include Assessed Russian Advance in Ukraine, Assessed Russian Gains in the Past 24 Hours, Assessed Russian Control, Claimed Russian Territory in Ukraine, or any other categories created by ISW that indicate Russian control. Given the specificity of the question and the need for concrete evidence from the ISW map, without access to real-time data or future predictions beyond the current date, it's challenging to provide a definitive probability. However, considering the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the fluctuations in territorial control, it's reasonable to approach this question with a cautious perspective. As of my last update, Chasiv Yar has been a contested area in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, but without current, specific information from the ISW map for June 1, 2024, we must consider a range of possibilities. The situation on the ground can change rapidly due to military actions, diplomatic efforts, or other factors. Given these considerations, a moderate approach to estimating the probability seems prudent. However, because the question's resolution depends on specific, future information that is not available at the time of my knowledge cutoff, and considering the volatile nature of the conflict, I must emphasize the speculative nature of any estimate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.023233269132310497, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.005808317283077624, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2418254167033373, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Political Experience and Public Presence: Donald Trump Jr. has been involved in politics, particularly through his support of his father's campaigns and presidency. He has also maintained a public presence through social media, books, and public appearances, which could help him in terms of name recognition and fundraising. 3. Competition within the Republican Party: The field of potential Republican candidates for 2024 is likely to be crowded, including possibly his father, former President Trump, if he decides to run again. Other potential candidates might include Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Ted Cruz, and others who have significant political experience and support within the party. 4.

The ability to win over delegates state by state is a complex mix of popular support, strategic maneuvering, and sometimes the internal politics of the state parties. 5.

Issues such as the economy, foreign policy, healthcare, and social justice movements can influence voter preferences. Donald Trump Jr.'s stance on these issues and his ability to navigate them will be critical.

Historical Context: In previous presidential election cycles, debates among candidates from the same party have been common, especially as the primary elections approach. These debates serve as platforms for candidates to articulate their policies, differentiate themselves from their opponents, and gain visibility among voters. 2. Current Political Landscape: As of the last update, several notable figures have been mentioned or have expressed interest in running for the Democratic nomination, including incumbent President Biden, Vice President Harris, Governor Newsom of California, and Governor Whitmer of Michigan, among others. The presence of multiple potential candidates usually necessitates debates as part of the democratic process to allow voters to make informed decisions. 3. Democratic National Committee's (DNC) Role: The DNC typically organizes and sanctions primary debates. The committee usually aims to provide a fair and transparent platform for candidates to reach a wide audience. Given the importance of the presidential election and the potential number of candidates, it's reasonable to expect the DNC to facilitate debates. 4. Public Interest and Media Demand: Debates are significant events that attract considerable media attention and public interest. News organizations often lobby for debates as they provide valuable content and help fulfill the media's role in informing the public about political issues and candidates. 5. Candidate Strategies: While incumbent presidents might sometimes avoid debates to maintain a strategic advantage, challengers usually seek debates to increase their visibility and critique the incumbent's record. Given the mix of potential candidates, including challengers to President Biden, there's likely to be pressure for debates. Considering these factors, it seems highly probable that there will be another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

Negative perceptions or lack of media attention could hinder his campaign.

Understanding the Condition (ChatGPT's Availability in the EU): The general availability of ChatGPT in the EU by June 30, 2024, indicates a significant development in AI accessibility. However, this directly relates more to OpenAI's strategic moves and regulatory compliance rather than directly influencing Google DeepMind's research and publication schedule. 2. Google DeepMind's Research and Publication Practices: Google DeepMind is known for its rigorous research and testing, including safety assessments of its AI models. The organization has been proactive in engaging with external experts for red-teaming exercises to evaluate and enhance the safety and ethics of its AI systems. This practice is part of its broader commitment to responsible AI development. 3. External Red-Teaming Reports: The publication of external red-teaming reports is less common than the practice of conducting the red-teaming exercises themselves. Companies might choose to keep such reports internal for various reasons, including competitive advantage, security, or avoiding unnecessary public scrutiny. However, there's a growing trend towards transparency in AI safety and ethics, which might encourage such publications. 4. Regulatory and Public Pressure: The EU is at the forefront of regulating AI with its proposed AI Act, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and safety. Companies like Google DeepMind might feel compelled to demonstrate their commitment to these principles through public reports, especially in regions with strong regulatory frameworks. Considering these points, while there is a trend towards more transparency and accountability in AI development, the direct connection between ChatGPT's availability in the EU and Google DeepMind publishing a specific type of report is not strong. The publication of such a report would more likely be influenced by Google DeepMind's internal policies, the outcomes of the red-teaming exercises, and broader regulatory or public pressures rather than the availability of a competitor's product in a specific market."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "4f506130-74af-4a0c-acaf-2807d604640d", "title": "Conditional on OpenAI's ChatGPT not being generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, will Google DeepMind publish a report with external red-teaming results by then?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: OpenAI's ChatGPT is not generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024. \"Not generally available\" here means that the default state for people in the EU is that they cannot access it without a VPN (possibly requiring paying for it.)

First, let's address the condition. The head of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, has been in her position since 2022. There is no recent or credible information suggesting she plans to resign or would be fired within the next 90 days. However, predicting personnel changes in such sensitive positions can be challenging due to the lack of publicly available information. Still, given the lack of any indication of an impending change, it's reasonable to assume continuity. Regarding the second component, Joe Biden's health and the likelihood of his death within the specified timeframe, it's essential to rely on publicly available health information. As of the last public health update, Joe Biden has been deemed fit for duty by his doctors, although he has had some health issues in the past. Predicting an individual's death, especially within a short timeframe, is inherently uncertain and subject to numerous variables, including unforeseen events. However, based on available information, there is no specific reason to believe Joe Biden's health is in immediate danger. Given these considerations, the probability that Joe Biden will die before Saturday, conditional on the head of the Secret Service not resigning within the next 90 days, leans towards being low.

Historical Performance: Malta has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest numerous times since its debut in 1971. While the country has not won the contest, it has qualified for the Grand Final several times, especially in recent years. This suggests that Malta has a certain level of consistency in producing competitive entries. 2. Qualification System: The qualification for the Grand Final is determined by a combination of jury and public voting in the Semi-finals. Countries that tend to do well usually have a strong song, memorable performance, and effective use of staging. Malta has shown the ability to adapt to these requirements, though success can vary greatly from year to year. 3. Competition Dynamics: The competition in Eurovision is fierce, with many countries bringing high-quality entries. The qualification is not just about the merits of a single country's entry but also about how it compares to others in the same Semi-final. Factors like song order, staging, and the overall vibe of the performance can influence voting. 4. Recent Trends: In recent years, there has been a trend towards more contemporary and experimental songs doing well, alongside a continued appreciation for strong vocal performances and emotional connections. Malta's ability to tap into these trends could influence its chances. Given these considerations, while it's difficult to predict the outcome with certainty without knowing the specifics of Malta's entry for 2024 (such as the song, artist, and staging plans), we can look at the general trend. Malta has shown resilience and the capacity to qualify in various contexts. Therefore, based on historical data and the general dynamics of the contest, a cautious optimism seems warranted. However, the nature of the competition means that even strong entries can miss qualification if the competition is particularly fierce or if the performance does not connect with the audience and juries as expected."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a427dbc5-8bab-4658-b6c9-3f551ac03c19", "title": "Will Slovenia qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Slovenia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Historical Performance: Slovenia has had mixed results in Eurovision. Understanding their past performance can give us a baseline for their potential success. However, past performance is not always a reliable predictor of future outcomes, especially in a competition that is highly dependent on the song, performance, and voting dynamics of the particular year. 2. Song and Artist Quality: The quality and appeal of the song, along with the performing artist's charisma and stage presence, play a significant role in a country's success in Eurovision. A catchy, well-performed song can significantly increase a country's chances of qualifying for the final. 3. Competition in the Semi-final: The level of competition in the semi-final that Slovenia participates in will also be a crucial factor. Some semi-finals are more competitive than others, depending on the countries participating and the quality of their entries. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geopolitical factors, cultural affinity, and diaspora voting. Countries with large diasporas or those that are part of voting blocs often have an advantage. Slovenia's position within these dynamics can affect its chances. 5. EBU's Official Announcement: The question specifically mentions that the qualification must be officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). This is a procedural aspect but emphasizes that the qualification must be confirmed through the official channels. Given these factors, without specific information on Slovenia's entry for 2024 (such as the song, artist, and performance details), it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, we can look at general trends: - Slovenia has qualified for the final in recent years, showing they have the capability to produce competitive entries. - The quality of the song and performance can greatly influence the outcome, and without knowing these details, we must assume a level of competitiveness based on past entries. - Voting patterns can be unpredictable, but Slovenia might benefit from regional voting to some extent.

Current Polling Trends: As of my last update, the specific polling numbers for July 15, 2024, are not available. However, the prompt mentions that as of July 5, 2024, Trump was 2.4 points ahead of Biden. This suggests a relatively close race but does not provide enough information on the trend leading up to July 15. 2. Polling Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological differences among polls. A swing of 0.6 to 1.6 points (to reach a lead of greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 from a 2.4-point lead) within a short period is plausible but depends heavily on the factors mentioned above. 3.

These are unpredictable and can impact the polls in either direction. 4. Margin of Error: Polling averages come with margins of error. While a 0.6 to 1.6-point shift is within the realm of possibility, the margin of error for individual polls (usually around 3-4%) and the aggregated average could affect whether the lead actually falls within the specified range. Considering these factors, predicting a precise lead within a narrow range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4) involves a high degree of uncertainty. Given the volatility of polls and the unpredictability of political events, it's challenging to assign a high probability to such a specific outcome.

This experience might help him in terms of name recognition and understanding the campaign process, but it also indicates his previous lack of success in gaining widespread support within the party. 2. Current Political Landscape: The Republican Party has undergone significant changes since Christie's last run, with a notable shift towards more populist and conservative stances under the influence of former President Donald Trump. Christie, known for his more moderate positions on some issues, might find it challenging to gain traction with the party's current base. 3. Competition: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 election is likely to be crowded, including several high-profile figures who might have stronger connections to the current Republican base. Christie would need to differentiate himself significantly and overcome the advantage of candidates with higher national profiles or more recent political successes. 4. Support and Endorsements: Christie's ability to secure endorsements from influential figures within the Republican Party and to build a strong campaign team will be crucial. However, given his past criticisms of Trump and his moderate stance on certain issues, he might find it difficult to secure the support needed to propel his campaign forward. 5. Public Perception and Polling: Current and future polling will provide insight into Christie's viability as a candidate. As of my last update, Christie hasn't been among the top contenders in speculative polls about the 2024 Republican nomination.

Chris Christie as the Republican Nominee: The first condition assumes Chris Christie is selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This is a hypothetical scenario, so we'll proceed under the assumption that it happens, regardless of its likelihood. 2. Biden Dropping Out or Unable to Continue: The question focuses on whether, under the given scenario, President Biden would drop out or be unable to continue his race for the presidency before July 20, midnight Eastern Time. Given these points, let's consider the factors that might influence President Biden's decision or ability to continue in the race: - Health Issues: Any significant health issues could force Biden to reconsider his candidacy. However, as of my last update, there's no public information suggesting he's facing such challenges that would necessitate dropping out. - Political Pressure: The selection of Chris Christie as the Republican nominee could potentially alter the political landscape, but it's uncertain how this would directly impact Biden's decision to stay in the race. Christie's nomination might be seen as a moderate choice, potentially altering the dynamics of the election, but it's not clear this would cause Biden to drop out. - Democratic Party Dynamics: The support and unity within the Democratic Party would also play a crucial role. If the party remains united behind Biden, it's less likely he would drop out. As of now, there's no widespread indication that the party is moving away from him. - Public Opinion and Polls: Significant shifts in public opinion or polls showing a substantial disadvantage against Christie could theoretically influence Biden's decision. However, polls and public opinion can be volatile, and it's uncertain how they would swing in this hypothetical scenario. Considering these factors, there's no clear indication that Biden would drop out or be unable to continue the race simply because Chris Christie is nominated. The decision to drop out would likely depend on a complex interplay of factors, including health, political strategy, party support, and public opinion, none of which can be predicted with certainty. Therefore, based on the information available and the hypothetical scenario presented, the likelihood of Biden dropping out or being unable to continue the race before July 20, midnight Eastern Time, given Chris Christie is the Republican nominee, seems low. This is because there's no clear, compelling reason presented in the scenario that would necessitate or strongly encourage Biden to drop out."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "bdfe487a-5a4f-46dd-b443-8e5b95241039", "title": "Given Chris Christie is not the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, will Biden drop out before July 20?", "body": "This question explores the conditional scenario where Chris Christie is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

First, let's address the condition: no nation winning more than one women's team sport. This condition is about the distribution of gold medals across eight women's team sports among different National Olympic Committees (NOCs). For our purposes, the specifics of this distribution don't directly impact the outcome of an athlete winning more than one medal in tennis, except in ensuring the condition is met for the question to be relevant. The outcome of interest is an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis. In tennis at the Olympics, athletes can compete in singles and doubles, with the possibility of winning medals in both. The likelihood of an athlete winning more than one medal can be influenced by several factors, including their skill level, competition format, the strength of the field, and the draw. Given the structure of tennis competitions, it's plausible for top athletes to compete in both singles and doubles. The probability of winning more than one medal, however, depends on success in both events, which is challenging due to the high level of competition and the physical demands of playing multiple matches. Reasoning: The condition (no nation winning more than one women's team sport) does not directly affect the outcome of tennis competitions. Athletes competing in both singles and doubles tennis events have a chance, albeit a challenging one, to win more than one medal. The probability of an athlete achieving this feat is influenced by their skill, the competition format, and the strength of the field. Given these considerations and the general competitiveness of Olympic tennis, the probability of an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis, without any direct influence from the specified condition, leans towards being low but not negligible, considering the presence of highly skilled athletes who can compete effectively in both singles and doubles."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.2536798384653608, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0634199596163402, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.8383994085200402, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Past Performance and Current Standing: Chris Christie served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018 and ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. However, he dropped out of the race early due to lackluster performance in primaries. Since then, Christie has remained a public figure but hasn't indicated a strong intention to run for president again. His past inability to gain significant traction and the lack of a current campaign infrastructure make his candidacy less likely. 2. Political Climate and Republican Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has undergone significant changes since Christie's last presidential bid, with a notable shift towards more conservative and populist candidates. The party's base has shown a strong preference for candidates closely aligned with former President Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Christie, known for his more moderate stance on some issues and criticism of Trump, might find it challenging to garner substantial support from the party's current base. 3. Potential Competitors: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 election includes several high-profile figures who might have a stronger claim to the nomination. These include, but are not limited to, former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and several current or former governors and senators who have built a national profile. The competition for the nomination is expected to be fierce, and Christie would need to outperform several strong contenders. 4. Nomination Process: The Republican nomination process involves a series of primaries and caucuses culminating in the Republican National Convention, where delegates officially select the party's nominee. Success in this process requires significant financial backing, a strong campaign organization, and the ability to connect with voters across various states. Christie would need to excel in these areas to secure the nomination. Considering these factors, while it's not impossible for Chris Christie to secure the Republican nomination, the odds appear to be against him. He faces challenges from his past performance, the current political climate of the Republican Party, strong competition, and the demands of the nomination process itself."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "70512ba3-0d39-4d0a-9601-71c140799d0d", "title": "Conditional on Chris Christie being the Republican nominee, will Tim Scott also be the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where Chris Christie is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

A brokered convention occurs when no single candidate wins a majority of the delegates on the first ballot, leading to subsequent rounds of voting. Historically, brokered conventions were more common before the modern primary system was established, but they can still happen if multiple strong candidates split the vote. The number of candidates is crucial; if there are multiple strong candidates, it increases the likelihood of a brokered convention. As of my last update, the Democratic field for 2024 is not overly crowded with top-tier candidates, which might reduce the likelihood of a brokered convention. The outcomes of the primaries and caucuses will significantly influence the distribution of delegates. If one candidate performs exceptionally well across the board, they are likely to secure the nomination on the first ballot. The Democratic Party has rules in place to encourage a candidate to achieve a majority of delegates. Superdelegates, for example, play a role but are limited in their ability to influence the first ballot's outcome due to reforms implemented after the 2016 election. However, they could play a crucial role in subsequent ballots, potentially leading to a brokered convention if no candidate achieves a majority on the first ballot. The proportional allocation of delegates in many states means that a candidate can win a state but not receive all of its delegates. This system can make it harder for a candidate to achieve a majority of delegates before the convention. Considering these factors, the likelihood of a brokered convention seems relatively low as of my last update, primarily because the field does not appear to be overly crowded with top-tier candidates, and the primary process is designed to encourage a candidate to achieve a majority.

Firstly, as of my last update, I don't have real-time access to current polling data. However, I can provide a general analysis based on how polling averages tend to behave over time. Polling averages like those provided by 538 are aggregate measures that combine data from multiple polls to give a more stable estimate of public opinion. These averages can fluctuate based on various factors, including significant political events, candidate performance, and changes in public opinion. Historically, polling averages have shown that leads in presidential races can be volatile, with fluctuations of several percentage points over short periods. However, as elections draw closer, polling tends to stabilize, reflecting more solidified public opinion. Given the specificity of the question\u2014Trump's lead being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points\u2014it represents a relatively narrow margin. For the lead to fall within this exact range on a specific date (July 15, 2024) suggests a high degree of precision in forecasting, which is challenging given the inherent uncertainties and fluctuations in polling data. Moreover, the resolution of this question depends on the polling data as reported on July 17, 2024, which introduces a slight delay and the potential for last-minute changes in public opinion or polling methodologies that could affect the outcome. Considering these factors, the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, seems relatively low due to the narrow margin specified and the inherent volatility of polling averages."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "39f4c91c-8b5d-44c8-8586-ac3459ba1cb5", "title": "Will Larry Elder be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Primary Field: The Republican field for the 2024 election is expected to be crowded, potentially including well-established figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others with significant political experience and national recognition.

Elder's ability to attract major donors and build a strong campaign infrastructure will be critical but is currently unproven at the national level. 4. Debate and Campaign Performance: Elder's performance in debates and on the campaign trail, including his ability to appeal to a broad segment of Republican voters, will be crucial. His experience as a radio host may benefit him in terms of communication skills, but translating this into broad voter appeal and trust remains to be seen. 5. Republican National Convention Dynamics: The nominee selection process at the convention can be unpredictable, influenced by factors like delegate loyalty, party unity concerns, and potential deal-making. However, without a strong showing in primaries, securing the nomination would be extremely difficult. Considering these factors, while Larry Elder might have a dedicated following and could potentially perform well in certain niches or areas, his overall chances of securing the Republican nomination for the 2024 US Presidential Election appear slim due to his relatively low national profile, lack of political experience in elected offices, and the expected competition from more established figures within the party."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "7c948260-e500-4759-9d04-28a86bdb2833", "title": "Conditional on Larry Elder being the Republican nominee, will Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The selection of the presidential nominee is determined by various factors such as the candidates' popularity, policies, and performance in the primaries, which are independent of the Olympic events. Therefore, I will treat the two events as independent and rely on general knowledge about the current political landscape and the Democratic Party's trends. Given the growing number of female politicians and the increasing awareness of women's rights, it is possible that the Democratic Party might choose a female nominee. However, without any specific information about the candidates or the current political climate, I will rely on historical data and general trends. In the past, the Democratic Party has nominated female candidates, such as Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Conditional on Tim Scott not being the Republican nominee: This condition implies we are considering a scenario where the Republican nominee is anyone but Tim Scott. The impact of this condition on Trump's lead over Biden would depend on the popularity and political stance of the actual nominee compared to Tim Scott. However, since the question focuses on Trump's lead, we must consider how Trump being or not being the nominee affects this scenario. 2. Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average: This part of the question focuses on the margin of difference in polling averages between Trump and Biden. A lead greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 indicates a relatively narrow but consistent margin in favor of Trump. 3. Assuming the condition is met (Tim Scott is not the nominee): If Tim Scott is not the nominee, and we are considering Trump's lead, it implies Trump is likely the nominee in this scenario. The question then becomes about the likelihood of Trump maintaining a lead over Biden within the specified margin. Given these considerations, we need to assess the likelihood of Trump having a lead over Biden within the specified range on July 15, 2024, assuming Trump is the nominee (since the condition excludes Tim Scott but doesn't exclude Trump, and Trump is a prominent candidate). Reasoning: The condition (Tim Scott not being the nominee) indirectly points towards considering Trump as the likely nominee. Trump's polling performance against Biden has historically shown tight margins, with various factors (including economic conditions, political events, and personal popularity) influencing these numbers. The specific margin (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) suggests a scenario where Trump is ahead but not by a wide margin, which is plausible given the polarized nature of U.S. politics. However, predicting a specific margin months in advance is challenging due to the volatility of public opinion and the influence of unforeseen events. Probability: Given the uncertainties and the specific margin required, the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3, assuming Trump is the nominee (and Tim Scott is not), would be moderate but not high due to the unpredictability of future events and polling volatility.

General Public Opinion Polls: These consistently show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, while other Democrats hypothetically surveyed either lead or are within the margin of error. This suggests a specific disadvantage for Biden compared to a generic Democrat in the general public's perception. 2. Manifold Respondents Representativeness: The question of whether Manifold respondents are representative of the general public is crucial. If they are, then the public opinion polls disadvantage for Biden might translate to the Manifold polls. However, if Manifold respondents have a different demographic or political leaning profile, the outcome could differ significantly. 3. Specific vs. Generic Candidate: Generally, a specific candidate (in this case, Joe Biden) might have both advantages and disadvantages compared to a generic candidate. A generic candidate is more of a blank slate, allowing respondents to project their preferred qualities onto them. Biden, being a well-known figure, comes with specific baggage and advantages, which might affect how people vote in a hypothetical matchup against Trump. 4. Margin of 3%: The question is not just whether Trump does better against Biden than a generic Democrat but whether this difference is at least 3%. This margin is significant enough that it requires a clear and substantial preference for Trump over Biden compared to Trump over a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. Given these factors: - The general public opinion polls suggest Biden has a specific disadvantage, which might translate to some degree among Manifold respondents if they are somewhat representative of the broader public. - However, the representativeness of Manifold respondents and the specific dynamics of a hypothetical matchup can introduce significant uncertainty. - The 3% margin is a relatively high bar, suggesting that a small or negligible difference in favor of Trump against Biden compared to a generic Democrat would not be enough to resolve the question to YES. Considering these points, while there's a rationale for believing Trump might do better against Biden than a generic Democrat, the uncertainty around Manifold respondents' representativeness and the specific dynamics of these hypothetical matchups makes it challenging to confidently predict a difference of at least 3%.

Early Announcement and Fundraising: Trump announced his candidacy early, which can give him a head start in terms of fundraising and organizing his campaign. This early start can also deter some potential challengers. 3. Potential Challengers: The field of potential challengers within the Republican Party includes figures like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others. The strength and viability of these challengers can impact Trump's chances. However, Trump has maintained a high level of popularity among Republican voters, which could make it difficult for challengers to gain traction. 4. Legal and Personal Challenges: Trump faces several legal challenges, including investigations and lawsuits. While these have not seemed to significantly impact his popularity among his base, they could potentially affect his broader appeal and create uncertainty around his candidacy. 5. Party Support: The Republican Party's leadership and machinery could play a significant role. If the party strongly backs Trump, it could clear his path to the nomination. Conversely, if there's significant opposition within the party, it could complicate his bid. 6. Primary Elections and Caucuses: The outcome of primary elections and caucuses will be crucial. Trump's performance in these will directly impact his chances of securing the nomination.

Historically, the BSE SENSEX has shown significant growth over the years, with some fluctuations. However, predicting the exact range of the index on a specific date far in the future is challenging due to the inherent volatility of stock markets. The performance of the BSE SENSEX is influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic indicators, political developments, global market trends, and sector-specific performance. Predicting these factors' impact on July 21, 2024, is highly speculative. Events such as elections, budget announcements, global economic shifts, or unforeseen crises (like the COVID-19 pandemic) can significantly impact the stock market. The likelihood and potential impact of such events on the BSE SENSEX by July 2024 are difficult to forecast. Given these considerations, predicting the exact closing value range of the BSE SENSEX on a specific date in the future involves a high degree of uncertainty.

Understanding the Condition: The condition given is that the Democratic Party does not require more than one round of voting in its roll call ballot to formally nominate its candidate for the 2024 US presidential election. This essentially means that if the Democrats can agree on a candidate without needing multiple rounds of voting, the condition is met. 2. Analyzing the Outcome: The outcome we are asked to predict is whether Francis Suarez will be selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, given that the condition is met. 3. Assessing Francis Suarez's Chances: As of my last update, Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, has not been widely discussed as a top contender for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election. The Republican field is typically dominated by well-known figures at the national level, such as former President Donald Trump, potential candidates like Ron DeSantis, and other prominent Republicans. 4. Connection Between the Condition and the Outcome: The condition (Democrats avoiding a brokered convention) does not directly influence the selection process of the Republican nominee. The two parties' nomination processes are independent of each other, with their own sets of candidates, party dynamics, and voter preferences. 5. Reasoning: Given the lack of direct connection between the Democrats' nomination process and the Republicans' choice of nominee, and considering Francis Suarez's relatively low profile at the national level compared to other potential Republican candidates, it is reasonable to conclude that the condition (Democrats avoiding a brokered convention) does not significantly impact Francis Suarez's chances of becoming the Republican nominee.

His term is set to end on January 20, 2025, unless he resigns, is impeached and removed, or passes away. 2. Election Cycle: The presidential election cycle for 2024 is already underway. However, the outcome of this cycle, including party nominations and the general election, does not directly impact Biden's presidency by the end of July 2024, as the general election is scheduled for November 2024. 3. Health and Age: There has been considerable speculation about Biden's health and age. However, as of the last available information, despite his advanced age, there has been no indication that he plans to step down due to health issues. 4. Impeachment or Resignation: Impeachment proceedings against Biden have been initiated by the House of Representatives but have not resulted in his removal from office. Given the political landscape, especially the composition of the Senate, which would need to convict him with a two-thirds majority, the likelihood of his removal through impeachment before the end of July 2024 seems low. 5. Voluntary Resignation: There has been no indication from Biden or his administration that he plans to resign voluntarily. Given these considerations, the most likely scenario is that Joe Biden will still be president by the end of July 2024, as there are no clear indications of his early departure from office due to the factors mentioned above."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "75d48749-4ece-4aef-b948-9ab672ea5fff", "title": "Will at least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early?", "body": "Context from Politico:\n\nDozens of House Democrats are organizing a plan to speak out against their own party\u2019s effort to seal President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination sooner than originally planned, which they argue stifles the intense ongoing debate about his candidacy, according to a lawmaker involved in the effort.\n\nA drafted letter, circulated by Rep.

Current Polling Average: As of the question's creation on July 9, 2024, Trump's lead over Biden is 2.4 points. This is within the specified range but closer to the lower bound. 2. Polling Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological differences among polls. However, significant shifts within a short period (like six days in this case) are less common, especially when considering averages that tend to smooth out individual poll variations. 3. Trend Direction: Without specific data on the trend direction, it's challenging to predict whether Trump's lead is increasing or decreasing. However, given the proximity to the election and the relatively stable nature of polling averages over short periods, drastic changes are unlikely. 4. Margin of Error: Polling averages also have margins of error, which can affect the interpretation of the lead. A lead of 2.4 points with a margin of error (typically around +/- 2-3% for national polls) suggests there's a possibility the actual lead could be slightly outside this range due to sampling error alone. Considering these factors: - The current lead is within the specified range but closer to the lower end. - Significant changes in polling averages over short periods are uncommon. - There's an inherent uncertainty due to margins of error. Given these considerations, it seems plausible that Trump's lead could remain within the specified range, especially considering the short timeframe and the nature of polling averages to not fluctuate wildly. However, predicting polling outcomes involves inherent uncertainty, and factors like unexpected events or systematic polling errors could influence the outcome. Therefore, while acknowledging the uncertainty and the potential for minor fluctuations, the probability seems to lean towards the affirmative given the current data and the general stability of polling averages over short periods."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "c24bf51a-0dc6-4e78-bd1c-ceb54eb9a421", "title": "Given Trump's lead over Biden is between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, will 538 project Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 points according to 538's national polling average. \n\nResolution criteria for this condition: This is based on the value reported by 538's national polling average for the 2024 presidential election as accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024.

Polling Average and Forecast Relationship: The polling average is a snapshot of current public opinion, while an election forecast takes into account a broader range of factors, including historical trends, the economy, fundraising, and the electoral map. A candidate can be behind in the polls but still be favored in a forecast if other indicators are strong. 2. FiveThirtyEight's Forecast Model: 538's model for forecasting the election incorporates a wide array of data, including but not limited to national polls. They also consider state-level polls, which are crucial for understanding the electoral college outcome. Other factors such as economic indicators and the candidates' past electoral performance also play a role. 3. Lead in Polls vs. Forecast Favorite: A lead of 2 to 4 points in national polls is relatively narrow. Such a margin can easily shift with the natural fluctuations in public opinion or in response to significant campaign events. Moreover, the electoral college system means that the winner of the popular vote is not guaranteed to win the presidency, further complicating the relationship between national polling averages and the outcome of the election. 4. Timing and Events: Between July 15 and July 19, significant events could occur that might shift public opinion or alter the perception of the candidates. For instance, major policy announcements, debates, or unforeseen events could impact the polls and, subsequently, the forecast. 5. Historical Context: Historically, summer polls have not been highly predictive of the final election outcome, with many elections experiencing shifts in public opinion as the campaign season progresses. Considering these factors, a 2 to 4 point lead for Trump in national polls does not guarantee that Biden won't be projected as the favorite to win the election by 538's forecast model. The model's incorporation of a wide range of data beyond just national polling averages means that other favorable indicators for Biden could outweigh a slight polling deficit. Given this context, the probability that Biden is projected as the favorite despite Trump's lead seems plausible but not certain. It would depend heavily on the specifics of other data points considered by the 538 model at the time."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "38f5e8a6-c416-4930-8e10-7fac976ebf33", "title": "Conditional on Trump's lead over Biden being <= 2 or > 4 on July 15, 2024, will 538 project Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's national polling average is either less than or equal to 2 points or greater than 4 points, as reported on the chart for that date.

Historically, both Norway and Finland have had mixed results in the Eurovision Song Contest. Norway has won the contest three times and has a relatively higher success rate of qualifying for the Grand Final compared to Finland. Finland, on the other hand, has won the contest once and has had a more variable performance, including several years of not qualifying for the Grand Final. However, in recent years, both countries have shown an ability to send competitive entries. The qualification for the Grand Final is heavily influenced by the semi-final performances, the quality of the songs, the stage performances, and the voting patterns, which include both jury and public votes. Given that Norway qualifies, it indicates a strong performance in their semi-final. For Finland to also qualify, they would need to deliver a compelling performance that resonates with both the jury and the public. The assumption here is that if Norway can qualify, it suggests that the voting patterns and song preferences that year are favorable to Nordic countries or that the quality of performances in their semi-final was particularly high. Considering these factors, the probability that Finland also qualifies, given Norway's qualification, is somewhat higher than a simple average of all participating countries' qualification rates, as it is conditioned on a positive outcome for a culturally and geographically similar country. However, it's also important to note that each entry's success is largely dependent on its own merits and the preferences of voters that year.

This base has remained largely loyal, which is a considerable advantage in primary elections. 2. Name Recognition and Media Presence: Trump has unparalleled name recognition and an ability to command media attention. This can be both a blessing and a curse, but in the context of a primary election, it means he can reach a wider audience without the need for extensive advertising, which is a significant advantage. 3. Fundraising Ability: As a former president with a wide base of supporters, Trump has a proven ability to raise significant funds for his campaigns. Financial resources are crucial in sustaining a campaign through the long and often grueling primary process. 4. Potential Challengers: The field of potential Republican challengers to Trump is a factor to consider. While there are several other notable figures within the party, none currently command the same level of recognition or have the same level of base support as Trump. Challengers will face significant hurdles in trying to surpass Trump in popularity and fundraising capabilities. 5. Health and Legal Issues: Trump's health and ongoing legal issues could potentially impact his ability to campaign effectively or even his eligibility to run. However, without concrete evidence of significant health decline or legal outcomes that would bar him from running, it's speculative to consider these as major factors at this point. 6. Party Support: The Republican Party's stance on Trump is complex. While he has considerable support among the base, there are also factions within the party that are actively working against him. However, the party's infrastructure and many of its leaders have largely aligned with Trump, which could provide him with crucial support during the nomination process.

Impact of Trump's Nomination: Donald Trump's presidency from 2016 to 2020 was marked by significant market volatility, trade tensions, and unpredictable policy decisions. His nomination could lead to increased uncertainty in global markets, potentially affecting the BSE SENSEX. However, the Indian stock market has shown resilience and independence from global trends in the past, especially when compared to other emerging markets. 2. Historical Performance of the BSE SENSEX: The BSE SENSEX has shown a general upward trend over the years, punctuated by periods of volatility. It has recovered from various global and local economic shocks, demonstrating its resilience. 3. Economic Conditions Leading Up to July 2024: The state of the global and Indian economies by July 2024 will significantly influence the BSE SENSEX. Factors such as inflation rates, interest rates, GDP growth, and the impact of any ongoing global conflicts will play crucial roles. Given the dynamic nature of these factors, it's challenging to predict their exact influence on the BSE SENSEX without more current data. Given these considerations, predicting the exact range of the BSE SENSEX on a specific date far in advance is inherently uncertain. The range of 75,000 to 77,000 represents a relatively narrow band for the index, which has shown the capability to move significantly in short periods. While the conditional scenario of Trump's nomination introduces a specific variable, the overall trajectory of the BSE SENSEX will be influenced by a wide array of factors, many of which are unpredictable or not directly related to Trump's nomination. Given the uncertainties involved, the probability of the BSE SENSEX closing value on July 21, 2024, being greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000, conditional on Donald Trump being the Republican nominee, is difficult to estimate with high confidence.

Historical Context: The relationship between Iran and Israel has been marked by hostility and covert operations for decades. However, overt military actions by Iran directly against Israel have been rare, with most aggressive actions being carried out by proxy forces such as Hezbollah. Current Tensions: As of the last update in 2023, tensions between Iran and Israel have remained high, with both countries engaging in a shadow war involving cyberattacks, sabotage, and targeted killings. However, these actions typically fall short of direct military confrontation. Strategic Interests: Iran's strategic interest in the region involves expanding its influence and securing its position against perceived threats, including the presence of the United States and its allies in the region. Direct military action against Israel would likely escalate tensions significantly and could draw in other countries, including the United States, which would not be in Iran's strategic interest. Proxy Forces: The use of proxy forces by Iran to attack Israeli interests is a common strategy that allows Iran to maintain plausible deniability and avoid direct confrontation. The market's exclusion of attacks by proxy forces suggests that only a direct and acknowledged military action by Iran would resolve the question to \"Yes.\" Economic and Diplomatic Pressure: Iran faces significant economic and diplomatic pressure, including sanctions. This pressure can influence its decision-making, potentially making it more cautious about engaging in direct military actions that could further isolate it internationally. Considering these factors, while there is a constant level of tension and hostility between Iran and Israel, the likelihood of Iran initiating a direct military action that is officially acknowledged and meets the criteria specified in the question is relatively low. This is because such an action would likely lead to significant escalation and could harm Iran's strategic interests more than help them."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "dd413775-e0c6-42d6-992c-957b315f7f25", "title": "Conditional on Iran initiating a military action on Israeli territory before August 13, 2024, will Donald Trump testify at the hush money trial?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Iran initiates a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory between July 30 and August 12, 2024, 11:59 PM ET.

Iran Initiating Military Action on Israeli Territory: This event involves geopolitical tensions and military actions in the Middle East, specifically between Iran and Israel. Such an event would have significant international implications, including potential responses from other countries, especially the United States, due to its strategic interests in the region. 2. Donald Trump Testifying at the Hush Money Trial: This event pertains to legal proceedings within the United States, specifically involving former President Donald Trump and his alleged involvement in 'hush money' payments to Stormy Daniels. The trial's progression, including whether Trump testifies, would be influenced by the U.S. legal system's procedures and the specific decisions of the court and Trump's legal team. Given the information provided in the scenario, there is no direct causal link between Iran initiating a military action on Israeli territory and Donald Trump's potential testimony at the hush money trial. These are two distinct events: one is a geopolitical/military action, and the other is a legal proceeding within the United States. However, one could consider indirect effects. For instance, if the situation in the Middle East escalates significantly due to Iran's actions, it might preoccupy U.S. government and media attention, potentially influencing the timing or conduct of domestic legal proceedings. Nonetheless, such an indirect effect would likely not directly impact whether Donald Trump testifies at the trial, as that decision would be more closely tied to legal strategies and requirements rather than external geopolitical events. Therefore, considering the lack of a direct causal relationship between the two events and the improbability of a significant indirect effect altering the course of the trial in such a specific manner (i.e., affecting Trump's testimony), the probability that Donald Trump testifies at the hush money trial, given the scenario of Iran initiating a military action on Israeli territory, remains largely independent of the military action itself. Probability: 0.3 This probability estimate is based on general considerations about the trial process and the possibility of Trump testifying, without assuming a direct link to the geopolitical event described.

The first condition pertains to the absence of an Iranian military response before August 13th, 2024. The second condition concerns whether Donald Trump will testify at the hush money trial. The question implies a potential connection between these two seemingly unrelated events, suggesting that the absence of an Iranian military response could influence Donald Trump's decision or obligation to testify. However, without explicit information on how these events are connected, we must consider them independently while acknowledging that unforeseen political or strategic factors could link them. Given the information and the complexity of predicting both Iranian military actions and legal proceedings involving high-profile individuals, it's challenging to establish a direct causal link between the two conditions without additional context. The probability of Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial, conditional on no Iranian military response, would likely be influenced more by the legal and strategic considerations surrounding the trial itself rather than the absence of an Iranian military action. However, considering the nature of the question and the requirement to provide a probability, we must weigh the general likelihood of these events. Without explicit evidence linking the two conditions, we lean on general knowledge about legal proceedings and geopolitical events. High-profile individuals often avoid testifying in trials due to potential legal risks, and geopolitical events like an Iranian military response are subject to a vast array of influencing factors, making both conditions inherently uncertain. Given the above considerations and the lack of a direct link between the conditions, assigning a precise probability is challenging. However, acknowledging the uncertainties and the general tendencies in similar scenarios, a cautious approach would be to assign a moderate probability, reflecting the complex interplay of factors without overestimating the predictability of these events."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.22257115247146522, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical Performance: Norway has a mixed record in Eurovision. While they have won the contest three times (1985, 1995, and 2009), they have also had years where they did not qualify for the final. However, in recent years, Norway has shown a relatively consistent performance, qualifying for the final in most instances. 2. Semi-final Format: The Eurovision semi-finals are divided into two nights, with half of the participating countries performing each night. The top 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final, based on a combination of jury and public voting. This format means that Norway will be competing directly against fewer than half of the total participating countries for a spot in the final. 3. Song and Artist Quality: A crucial factor in Norway's success will be the quality and appeal of their song and artist. Norway often selects its entry through a national final called Melodi Grand Prix, which allows for a variety of artists and song styles to compete. The selection process aims to choose an entry that will appeal to both the international juries and the public. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical and cultural factors, with some countries showing a tendency to vote for their neighbors or countries with similar cultural backgrounds. Norway might benefit from some neighborly love, especially from other Nordic countries, but this is not a guarantee of qualification. 5. Competition: The overall quality of entries in Eurovision 2024 will also play a significant role. In a year with many strong entries, the competition for the top 10 spots in each semi-final will be fiercer. Considering these factors, while there are no guarantees in Eurovision, Norway's recent track record and the semi-final format suggest a somewhat favorable outlook for qualification.

Norway has a mixed history in Eurovision, with some years seeing high rankings and others resulting in low scores or even 'nul points.' However, Norway has shown a consistent presence in the contest and has a strategy for selecting its entries, which sometimes involves sending well-known artists or novel performances that can attract a broad audience. The assumption that Switzerland does not qualify does not directly influence Norway's chances since each country's qualification is determined independently through a combination of jury and public voting. However, in a broader strategic context, the absence of Switzerland from the Grand Final might slightly alter the voting dynamics, especially if Switzerland and Norway tend to appeal to similar voting blocs or demographics. This effect, however, is likely to be minimal and unpredictable. Eurovision voting patterns often show regional and cultural biases. Norway, being part of the Nordic countries, may benefit from neighborly voting, which can sometimes provide a safety net of points. However, this is not a guarantee, as the quality of the entry, performance, and overall competition play significant roles. The most significant factor in determining Norway's qualification chances is the quality of its entry and the performance on the night of the semi-final.

Understanding Eurovision Qualification: In Eurovision, countries that are not part of the 'Big Five' (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) must participate in one of two semi-finals. From each semi-final, the top 10 countries, as determined by a combination of jury and public voting, qualify for the Grand Final. 2. Albania and Georgia's Participation History: Both Albania and Georgia have been regular participants in Eurovision. Albania has participated since 2004, and Georgia since 2007. Both countries have had mixed success, with Albania qualifying for the final several times and Georgia also having qualified, though less frequently than Albania. 3. Factors Influencing Qualification: Qualification for the Grand Final can depend on various factors, including the quality of the song, the performance on the night, the popularity of the artist, the running order in the semi-final, and the voting patterns of the countries participating in the same semi-final. 4. Assessing the Scenario: Given that Albania qualifies, this indicates that Albania's song, performance, and voting support were strong enough to secure a top 10 spot in its semi-final. However, this does not directly influence Georgia's chances, as Georgia would be competing in a different set of circumstances, possibly even in the other semi-final. 5. Georgia's Chances: Without specific information about Georgia's entry (such as the song quality, artist popularity, and performance quality), it's challenging to assess its chances accurately. However, historically, Georgia has qualified less frequently than Albania, suggesting that, on average, Georgia might face more challenges in securing a top 10 spot. 6. Conclusion: Since the qualification of one country does not directly affect the other, and considering Georgia's historical performance, it's reasonable to approach this question with a neutral to slightly pessimistic view regarding Georgia's qualification, given no additional information about the entries."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "d04ce919-9952-4e50-87c5-c200b2f75da0", "title": "Given Albania fails to qualify, will Georgia qualify for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Albania does not participate in a Semi-final or is not officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Understanding the Scenario: The question posits a scenario where Albania fails to qualify for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final. This could be due to either not participating in a Semi-final or not being announced as a qualifier by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). 2. Eurovision Qualification Process: In the Eurovision Song Contest, countries (except the 'Big Five' - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, which automatically qualify) must participate in one of two Semi-finals. From these Semi-finals, a certain number of countries qualify for the Grand Final based on a combination of jury and public voting. 3. Albania's Performance History: Albania has had mixed success in the Eurovision Song Contest. Their qualification history doesn't directly influence Georgia's chances, but it's worth noting that Albania's performance doesn't correlate with Georgia's performance. 4. Georgia's Performance History: Georgia has also had variable success in the contest. Their qualification for the Grand Final is dependent on the quality of their entry, the performance of their artist, and the voting preferences of both the juries and the public in their respective Semi-final. 5. Assessing the Impact: The key point here is whether Albania's failure to qualify would have any direct impact on Georgia's chances. In the Eurovision qualification process, each country's success is largely independent of the others, with the exception of the competitive aspect within the Semi-finals where countries are directly competing for a limited number of spots in the Grand Final. 6. Conclusion: Given that each country's qualification is based on its own merits and performance, Albania's failure to qualify does not inherently increase or decrease Georgia's chances of qualifying. The outcome for Georgia is contingent on the factors directly related to their performance and the voting results in their Semi-final. 7. Probability Assessment: Without specific information about the entries, performances, or voting trends for Eurovision 2024, we must consider the general competitiveness of the contest. Historically, about half of the countries in each Semi-final qualify for the Grand Final. However, this probability can be influenced by many factors, including song quality, performance, and geopolitical voting patterns. Given the lack of direct correlation between Albania's and Georgia's performances, and without specific details on entries or voting patterns for 2024, we can only estimate Georgia's qualification chances based on general historical data."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.008068661659588694, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0020171654148971735, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1544109307426641, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Past Performance: Australia has been participating in Eurovision since 2015 and has had a relatively successful run, qualifying for the Grand Final every year except for 2021. This history of success suggests that Australia has a good understanding of what works in the contest and has a strong selection process for its entries. 2. Competition Format: The Eurovision Song Contest is divided into two semi-finals, with the top 10 countries from each semi-final qualifying for the Grand Final. This means that out of the participating countries in each semi-final, half or slightly more than half will qualify. The exact number of participants in Eurovision 2024 and the semi-final allocation for Australia are not known at this time, but generally, Australia faces competition from around 17-18 other countries in its semi-final. 3. Subjective Voting System: Eurovision's voting system is a mix of jury and public voting, which introduces a significant amount of unpredictability. Factors such as song quality, performance, staging, and even geopolitical considerations can influence voting. However, Australia's entries have generally been well-received by both juries and the public. 4. Entry Quality and Performance: As of the last update, the specifics of Australia's entry for Eurovision 2024, including the artist and song, are not known. The quality of the entry and the live performance are crucial factors in determining success in the contest. Australia has a track record of selecting competitive entries, but the impact of the 2024 entry on voters is yet to be seen. Given these considerations, while there are many variables that can affect the outcome, Australia's consistent past success in qualifying for the Grand Final provides a strong basis for optimism.

From each semi-final, the top 10 countries, as determined by a combination of jury and public voting, qualify for the Grand Final. 2. Denmark's Non-Qualification Impact: The premise assumes Denmark does not qualify for the Grand Final. Denmark's performance or lack thereof in the semi-finals does not directly impact Poland's chances of qualification since each country's qualification is determined by its own performance and voting results. 3. Poland's Qualification Chances: Poland's ability to qualify for the Grand Final depends on several factors, including the quality of their entry (song and performance), the competition in their assigned semi-final, and the voting preferences of both the juries and the public in the countries voting in that semi-final. 4. Historical Performance: While past performance is not a definitive indicator of future success, Poland has had mixed results in the contest. However, recent years have seen a resurgence in their fortunes, including qualifications to the Grand Final. 5. Competition and Voting Dynamics: The Eurovision Song Contest is known for its unpredictable nature, with voting patterns influenced by a complex mix of song quality, performance, cultural preferences, and geopolitical factors. Poland's chances will be affected by the specific lineup of the semi-final they are in and how their entry resonates with voters. Given these considerations, predicting Poland's qualification with certainty is challenging.

First, let's examine the condition regarding Mike Pence. Pence, a former Vice President under Donald Trump, has been considered a potential candidate for the 2024 Republican nomination. However, the field for the Republican nomination is likely to be crowded, including other prominent figures such as Donald Trump himself, Ron DeSantis, and others. The outcome of the Republican primaries and the eventual nominee will depend on various factors, including each candidate's campaign strength, fundraising capabilities, debate performances, and how Republican voters perceive them. At this point, while Mike Pence has a certain level of support within the Republican Party, it's difficult to predict with certainty who will secure the nomination. Next, let's consider the outcome concerning President Biden. Speculation about Biden not seeking re-election or being unable to continue the race could stem from various factors, including his age, health, or political considerations. However, as of the last available information, President Biden has indicated an intention to run for re-election. The decision to drop out would likely be influenced by his health, his perceived chances of winning, and the overall political climate. It's worth noting that once a President has committed to seeking re-election, dropping out is an extraordinary step that would likely only be taken under compelling circumstances. Given the conditional nature of the question and the complexities involved, we need to assess the likelihood of President Biden dropping out before July 20, 2024, specifically under the scenario where Mike Pence is not the Republican nominee. Since the identity of the Republican nominee would be just one of many factors influencing President Biden's decision-making process, and considering that President Biden's decision to run for re-election is not directly tied to the identity of his potential opponent, the probability that he drops out specifically because Mike Pence is not the nominee seems low. President Biden's decision on whether to continue his campaign would likely be more heavily influenced by his own readiness and ability to serve, the support of his party, and his perceived ability to win the election, rather than the identity of the Republican nominee."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.04041160033308105, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, as of now, there hasn't been any significant public indication that his health would prevent him from seeking re-election. 2. Political Climate and Approval Ratings: The decision to run for re-election can also depend on the President's approval ratings and the overall political climate. Presidents with higher approval ratings are generally more likely to seek re-election. Biden's approval ratings have fluctuated but have often been around or slightly below 50%, which is relatively low but not uncommon for a president at this stage in their term. 3. Economic Conditions: Economic conditions play a significant role in election outcomes. If the economy is performing well, it might encourage Biden to seek re-election. Conversely, a struggling economy might deter him. The U.S. economy has faced challenges, including inflation, but has also shown resilience in job creation and growth. 4. Democratic Party's Support: The level of support from within the Democratic Party is crucial. If there's strong support for Biden's re-election, he's more likely to run. As of my last update, while there have been discussions about potential alternatives, the party has largely rallied around Biden. 5. Personal Desire to Run: Ultimately, the decision to run for re-election is a personal one. Joe Biden has expressed his intention to run for re-election in the past, but personal considerations, including his age and the demands of the presidency, could influence his final decision. Given these factors, while there are valid reasons why Joe Biden might decide not to seek re-election, there has been no clear indication from him or his campaign that he intends to step down.

Given that condition, the question then focuses on whether Will Hurd will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The question starts with the assumption that Joe Biden will announce he will not seek or accept the Democratic nomination. This is a hypothetical scenario and does not directly influence the selection process of the Republican nominee but could potentially affect the dynamics of the election by changing the focus or strategies of the Republican candidates. The Republican nominee is selected through a combination of primary elections, caucuses, and the final selection at the Republican National Convention. This process involves significant campaigning, debates, and political maneuvering among potential candidates. As of my last update, Will Hurd has announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. However, the field of candidates for the Republican nomination is typically crowded, and the outcome depends on numerous factors, including campaign performance, fundraising, and how candidates resonate with Republican voters and delegates.

General Public Opinion Polls: These consistently show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error. However, when other Democrats are hypothetically surveyed, they either poll ahead of Trump or are within the margin of error. This suggests a specific disadvantage for Biden in the general public's perception compared to other Democratic candidates. 2. Manifold Respondents: The question is specifically about the behavior of Manifold respondents, not the general public. However, if we assume that Manifold respondents are somewhat representative of broader trends (though this is a big assumption given the specific nature of online communities and polling), we might expect to see a similar pattern where Trump does better against Biden than against a generic Democrat. 3. The Specific Nature of the Polls: The polls in question are specific to Manifold and involve a direct comparison between Trump and Biden in one case, and Trump and a generic Democrat in the other. The formula for determining the percentage of votes for Trump takes into account votes for Trump, the Democrat in question, and 'Someone else,' providing a clear method for calculating Trump's performance relative to his opponent in each poll. Given these considerations, the key question is whether the disadvantage Biden faces in general public opinion polls will also manifest among Manifold respondents, and if so, whether this disadvantage will be significant enough for Trump to gain at least 3% more against Biden compared to a generic Democrat. While it's challenging to directly translate general public opinion to the behavior of Manifold respondents, the consistent pattern of Biden underperforming other Democrats in hypothetical matchups against Trump in public polls could suggest a similar trend among Manifold respondents. However, the magnitude of this effect (whether it exceeds 3%) is harder to predict without specific data on how Manifold respondents have voted in similar polls in the past or without a deeper understanding of the demographics and voting behaviors of Manifold users. Given the information available and the considerations above, a cautious approach would be to slightly favor the possibility that Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat, based on the broader trends observed in public opinion polls.

Understanding Eurovision Qualification Process: In Eurovision, countries are divided into two semi-finals. From each semi-final, a certain number of countries qualify for the Grand Final based on a combination of jury and public voting. The qualification of one country does not directly influence the qualification of another, as each country's performance is evaluated independently. 2. Analyzing the Premise: The premise that Czechia qualifies for the Grand Final gives us some indirect information. It suggests that Czechia's performance was strong enough to be voted into the final by either the public, the jury, or both. However, this does not provide direct insight into Belgium's performance or its chances of qualification. 3. Relationship Between Countries' Performances: While there's no direct causal relationship between Czechia's qualification and Belgium's potential qualification, there are some very indirect considerations. For instance, the overall quality and competitiveness of the semi-final that both countries participate in could influence the likelihood of qualification. If one semi-final is significantly more competitive than the other, the odds of qualification might be slightly skewed. However, without knowing the specifics of the performances, the voting patterns, or even which semi-final both countries are in, this is speculative. 4. Historical Performance and Trends: Looking at historical data could provide some insights. Countries with a strong track record in Eurovision might have an edge in terms of production quality, song selection, and performance experience. However, Eurovision is notoriously unpredictable, with many factors influencing voting, including cultural preferences, political sympathies, and the random allocation of countries to semi-finals. 5. Conclusion: Given the lack of direct causal relationship between Czechia's qualification and Belgium's, and without specific information about the performances, voting patterns, or even which semi-final Belgium is in, we're left to consider general probabilities. The qualification process is competitive, and while some countries have historical advantages, surprises are common. The question essentially asks for the probability of an independent event (Belgium qualifying) given another independent event has occurred (Czechia qualifying). Without direct causal linkage or specific information to skew probabilities, we lean on the general competitiveness of Eurovision and the inherent unpredictability of the contest."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "11194572-f817-401d-9af9-03de4ed12863", "title": "If Czechia fails to qualify for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, will Belgium qualify?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Czechia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as not having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Current Polling Trends: As of the last available data (not provided in the question but for the sake of reasoning, let's assume it's around the time the question was created), Trump was leading Biden by 2.4 points. However, without access to the most current data up to July 2024, it's challenging to assess the latest trends accurately. 2. Volatility in Polls: Polling averages can fluctuate over time due to various factors, including changes in public opinion, political events, and the methodology of the polls included in the average. The range specified in the question (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) is relatively narrow, which means small shifts in public opinion or polling methodology could significantly impact whether the condition is met. 3. Historical Context: In previous presidential elections, polling averages have shown variability, but often, as the election draws closer, the numbers tend to stabilize. However, given that this question pertains to a specific date in July, more than three months before the actual election, there is still ample time for significant shifts in public opinion. 4. Margin of Error: Polling averages, like individual polls, have margins of error. The condition specified is within a narrow range, which might be within or close to the margin of error of some polls, making the outcome more uncertain. 5. External Events: Between the time the question was posed and July 15, 2024, numerous events could occur that might influence public opinion, including debates, policy announcements, and unforeseen political or economic developments.

Initially, the country struggled to qualify for the final, but in recent years, there has been an improvement. Notably, in 2018, Mikolas Josef achieved a 6th place finish, which is the country's best result to date. Understanding Czechia's historical performance provides a baseline for expectations but does not guarantee future success. 2. Song and Artist Selection Process: The method by which Czechia selects its Eurovision entry can significantly impact its chances. Some years, the selection process involves a national final where the public and/or a jury decide on the entry, while other years, the entry is internally selected by the broadcaster. The effectiveness of this process in choosing a competitive entry can vary. 3. Competition: The level of competition in Eurovision is high, with many countries investing significant resources into their entries. Factors such as song quality, performance, staging, and the artist's charisma play crucial roles. Additionally, voting patterns, including political and cultural biases, can influence the outcome. 4. Recent Trends and Reforms: The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) occasionally introduces reforms to the contest's format and voting system. These changes can affect countries' qualification chances. For example, changes in how the semi-final allocations or the voting system work might favor or disfavor certain countries. Given these considerations, predicting Czechia's qualification with certainty is challenging without knowing the specifics of their 2024 entry, the competition, and any potential format changes.

While he has had health issues in the past, there's no public indication of any severe condition that would prevent him from serving out his term. However, age-related health concerns could always arise unexpectedly. 2. Political Stability: The political landscape in the United States has been highly polarized. Impeachment proceedings against presidents have become more common in recent years, though actual removal from office remains rare. For Biden to be removed, there would need to be significant bipartisan support, which, given the current political climate, seems unlikely unless there were extraordinary circumstances. 3. Legal Issues: Any legal issues that could potentially threaten Biden's presidency are speculative at this point. Legal challenges to a president are complex and usually protracted, making it unlikely for such issues to result in removal from office within a short timeframe. 4. Historical Precedent: Historically, presidents who have not completed their terms have either resigned (Richard Nixon) or been assassinated (John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, and William McKinley). The likelihood of such events, while impossible to predict with certainty, is statistically low. 5. Term Completion Rates: Most U.S. presidents complete their terms.

Geopolitical Tensions and Market Volatility: Attacks or significant geopolitical tensions often lead to increased uncertainty in financial markets. This uncertainty can result in higher volatility as investors become more cautious and reactive to news, leading to larger swings in stock prices. Given the nature of the proposed scenario, an attack by Israel within Iran would likely increase tensions not only between those two nations but also potentially draw in other countries, either directly or through diplomatic channels. This escalation could lead to increased uncertainty and, consequently, higher market volatility. 2. Historical Precedents: Past instances of significant geopolitical events have shown a correlation with increased market volatility. For example, the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and more recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, all led to immediate increases in market volatility indices. While the impact of such events can vary, the initial reaction often involves a spike in volatility. 3. Economic Conditions: The state of the global economy on July 20, 2024, will also play a role. If the economy is already experiencing or is on the brink of a downturn, the added geopolitical stress could exacerbate market volatility. Conversely, if the economy is strong, markets might be more resilient to geopolitical shocks, though the immediate reaction could still involve increased volatility. 4. Market Expectations and Sentiment: The anticipation of future volatility, as measured by indices like the VXVCLS, also reflects market sentiment and expectations. If investors anticipate that the situation in the Middle East could escalate further or lead to broader global tensions, this could keep volatility elevated even if the initial shock begins to wear off. 5. Policy Responses: The reaction of central banks and governments to both the geopolitical event and the economic conditions at the time could influence market volatility. For example, if there's a perception that central banks might raise interest rates to combat inflation or that governments might implement policies to mitigate economic impacts, this could influence market sentiment and volatility. Given these considerations, the probability of the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index being higher on July 20, 2024, compared to July 20, 2023, assuming a deadly attack by Israel within Iran before May 1, 2024, leans towards an increase in volatility.

Current Polling Trend: As of the question's creation on July 9, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points. This suggests a current advantage for Trump, but it's essential to consider the margin of error and the potential for fluctuations in polling numbers. 2. Stability of Polling Averages: Polling averages like those provided by 538 tend to be more stable than individual polls because they aggregate data from multiple sources. However, they are not immune to changes in public opinion or significant events that could influence voter preferences. 3. Time Frame: The question pertains to a specific date (July 15, 2024), which is relatively close to the current date (July 9, 2024). The likelihood of significant shifts in public opinion within such a short period is lower, but not impossible, especially in the context of a presidential election where new information and events can rapidly influence public opinion. 4. Margin of Error and Statistical Variability: Even if the underlying preferences of the electorate remain constant, polling averages can fluctuate due to the margin of error in individual polls and statistical variability. Given these considerations, the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4) on July 15, 2024, can be estimated by considering the stability of current trends and the potential for minor fluctuations. It seems reasonable to expect that absent any major events, the polling average might remain relatively stable, but the precise lead could fluctuate.

This position typically gives her a strong advantage in being renominated for the role, assuming the Biden-Harris ticket seeks reelection. 2. Relationship with the Presidential Nominee: The relationship between the President and the Vice President can significantly influence the nomination decision. Public appearances and statements from the White House have generally shown a supportive and collaborative relationship between Biden and Harris, which would favor her renomination. 3. Historical Precedents: Historically, incumbent Vice Presidents seeking to remain in their role under the same President are usually renominated. This precedent suggests a high likelihood of Harris being renominated, assuming historical patterns hold. 4. Political Climate: The political climate can significantly impact nomination decisions. Factors such as public opinion, party unity, and the strategic considerations for the presidential election can influence whether an incumbent VP is seen as an asset or a liability. As of 2023, while there have been various challenges and criticisms, there's no widespread indication within the Democratic Party that Harris would be replaced.

Historical Precedent: It's not uncommon for top tennis players to compete in and win multiple events at the Olympics. For instance, the Williams sisters have both won multiple gold medals in singles and doubles. Given the right combination of skill, experience, and draw, it's plausible for an athlete to win more than one medal. 2. Competition Format: Tennis at the Olympics typically includes singles and doubles events for both men and women, as well as a mixed doubles event. The more events an athlete participates in, the higher their chances of winning multiple medals. However, the physical demands of tennis, especially in a condensed Olympic schedule, can limit the ability to perform at a high level across multiple events. 3. Player Depth and Competition: The depth of talent in tennis is incredibly high. The likelihood of an athlete winning multiple medals depends on their ability to consistently outperform a field of top competitors. Only a handful of players in each generation have the dominance to achieve such a feat. 4. Recent Form and Injuries: The form of top players going into the Olympics, as well as any injuries they may be dealing with, can significantly impact their chances of winning multiple medals. An athlete in top form and good health has a much better chance than one struggling with their game or physical issues. 5. Partnerships in Doubles: Success in doubles often depends on the strength of the partnership. Athletes who have a regular doubles partner they perform well with have a better chance of winning an additional medal in doubles or mixed doubles. Considering these factors, while it is challenging for an athlete to win more than one medal in tennis at the Olympics, it is certainly possible, especially for those who are among the very best in their discipline and have a strong doubles partnership."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "cd0dfed5-f99b-40de-85b2-a3313d3d655a", "title": "Will Individual Neutral Athletes Win \u226521 Gold Medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Individual Neutral Athletes collectively win 21 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

Definition and Performance of Individual Neutral Athletes: Individual Neutral Athletes typically compete under the Olympic flag rather than representing a specific country, often due to geopolitical reasons or sanctions against their national Olympic committees. Their performance can vary widely across different sports and events. 2. Competitive Landscape: The Olympics feature the world's top athletes, and the competition for gold medals is extremely fierce. The ability of Individual Neutral Athletes to secure a significant number of gold medals depends on their talent, preparation, and the specific competition they face in each event. 3. Historical Precedent: While there have been instances of athletes competing under neutral flags in the past, the scale of their participation and success can vary greatly from one Olympics to another. Without specific recent data on the performance of Individual Neutral Athletes, it's challenging to establish a clear baseline for expectations. 4.

Condition on Trump's Lead: The question specifies a condition based on Trump's lead over Biden in the 538 national polling average on July 15, 2024. The condition is that Trump's lead must be either less than or equal to 3 points or greater than 4 points. This condition seems to suggest a scenario where the race is either relatively close (within 3 points) or where Trump has a somewhat significant lead (more than 4 points). 2. Biden's Interview: The question asks whether Joe Biden will have an in-person interview or conversation on camera for at least 45 minutes before the end of July 2024, given the condition on Trump's lead. The interview cannot include press conferences, speeches, rallies, fundraisers, town halls, etc., but can include appearances on a podcast, late-night show, or an interview edited into a show like 60 minutes, provided there is at least 45 minutes of new footage of Biden being interviewed in-person. 3. Strategic Considerations: The likelihood of Biden having such an interview might depend on strategic considerations by his campaign team. If Trump's lead is significant (more than 4 points), Biden's team might seek opportunities for extended interviews to reach a wider audience and close the gap. Conversely, if the race is close (within 3 points), they might either avoid such interviews to minimize risks or embrace them to solidify their position, depending on their confidence in Biden's performance and the campaign's overall strategy. 4. Availability and Scheduling: The feasibility of arranging and conducting a 45-minute in-person interview within the specified timeframe also depends on logistical factors, such as Biden's schedule, the availability of suitable platforms or shows, and the willingness of both parties to engage in such an interview. Given these considerations, it's challenging to estimate the probability with high precision without more specific information about the campaign's strategies and scheduling considerations. However, considering the strategic importance of such interviews in influencing public opinion, especially in a context where the race might be close or where one candidate seeks to overcome a significant lead, it seems plausible that Biden's team would seek or accept opportunities for extended interviews.

As of my last update, Ron DeSantis is considered a potential candidate, but the Republican field could include several other contenders, such as Donald Trump, if he decides to run again, and other potential candidates. The dynamics of primary elections can be highly unpredictable, influenced by numerous factors including campaign strategies, debates, voter turnout, and external events. 2. **Outcome: Biden remains President through the end of July 2024.** For President Biden to remain in office through the end of July 2024, several conditions must be met: a. **He must not resign.** There has been no indication from President Biden or the White House that he intends to resign. b. **He must not pass away.** While President Biden is advanced in age, there is no public information suggesting he is in poor health that would lead to his death before the end of July 2024. c. **He must not be removed from office.** This could happen through impeachment and conviction or through the 25th Amendment due to incapacity. As of now, there are no ongoing impeachment proceedings against President Biden, and there is no indication that the 25th Amendment is being considered for his removal. Given these considerations, let's assess the probabilities: - The condition that Ron DeSantis is not the Republican nominee could go either way, but it's not directly relevant to whether Biden remains President through July 2024 unless DeSantis's nomination significantly impacts Biden's presidency in unforeseen ways. - The key factors for Biden remaining President through July 2024 seem stable: there's no clear reason to believe he'll resign, his health appears stable for his duties, and there's no current mechanism for his removal that seems likely to succeed before the end of July 2024. Therefore, based on the information available and the analysis above, the probability that Biden remains President through the end of July 2024, given that Ron DeSantis is not the Republican nominee, seems relatively high because the factors that could lead to his removal or resignation appear unlikely as of the current assessment."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Polling averages are inherently uncertain: Polling averages, such as those provided by 538, are subject to various sources of uncertainty, including sampling error, non-response bias, and model assumptions. This uncertainty can lead to fluctuations in the estimated lead of one candidate over another. 2. Lead sizes are relatively small: The question asks about a lead of greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 percentage points, which is a relatively small margin. Small changes in public opinion or polling methodology can result in changes of this magnitude. 3. Time until the resolution date: The question resolves on July 17, 2024, which is roughly a year after the question was created. A lot can happen in a year, including changes in the candidates' popularity, new policy announcements, and external events that can influence public opinion. 4. Historical context: In the 2020 US presidential election, the polling averages were relatively stable, with Biden consistently leading Trump. However, there were periods where Trump's support surged, and the lead narrowed. This historical context suggests that while it's possible for Trump's lead to be within the specified range, it's also possible that Biden's lead could increase or decrease. 5. Current polling trends: As of the question's creation date (June 28, 2023), the 538 national polling average showed Trump leading Biden by 2.4 points. However, this information is subject to change and may not reflect the situation on July 15, 2024.

The outcome for the most successful athlete is more dependent on the specific talents and competition within each sport rather than the number of new countries winning gold. Second, consider the sport of swimming itself. Swimming has historically been one of the sports with the highest number of medals available at the Olympics, often second only to athletics (track and field). This means there are more opportunities for swimmers to win multiple gold medals compared to athletes in sports with fewer medal events. Third, the nature of swimming competitions allows for athletes to participate in multiple events, increasing their chances of winning multiple gold medals. Swimmers like Michael Phelps have demonstrated this in the past, winning numerous gold medals in a single Olympics. However, the ability to dominate in such a manner is rare and dependent on exceptional talent and competition dynamics. Lastly, while the condition of fewer than 5 countries winning their debut gold might slightly alter the competitive landscape, it's unlikely to significantly impact the chances of a swimmer being the most successful athlete in terms of gold medals. The success of top athletes is more directly influenced by their personal performance, the strength of their competition, and the specific events they participate in. Given these considerations, the probability that a swimmer will win the most gold medals under the specified condition is somewhat favorable due to the nature of swimming competitions and the historical precedence of swimmers winning multiple gold medals. However, it's essential to acknowledge the unpredictability of Olympic competitions and the emergence of exceptional athletes in various sports."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.07139253592231498, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.017848133980578745, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44185520856453253, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, the Olympics have a long history of countries winning their first-ever gold medals. As more countries participate and the level of competition increases, the likelihood of new countries breaking through for their first gold also increases. However, the number of debut gold medals can vary significantly from one Olympics to another. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, for example, several countries won their first-ever gold medals, including Bermuda, the Philippines, and Qatar. This indicates that there is a precedent for multiple countries achieving this milestone in a single Olympics. However, achieving at least 5 debut gold medals would require a combination of factors to come together, including the emergence of new talent, strategic investments in sports development by governments or private entities, and perhaps a bit of luck in terms of the competition landscape. Given the increasing global participation in sports and the investment in sports infrastructure and talent development by many countries, it's reasonable to expect that several countries could win their first gold medals at the 2024 Olympics. However, predicting the exact number is challenging due to the complex interplay of factors involved. Considering these points, while it's plausible that at least 5 countries could win their debut gold medals, the exact number is hard to predict, and historical precedents suggest that it's a challenging but not impossible target."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "04d41283-305f-4cf8-9c26-0295600b3428", "title": "Will Individual Neutral Athletes Win \u226515 Gold Medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Individual Neutral Athletes collectively win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

Individual Neutral Athletes winning \u226515 gold medals: The scenario is predicated on this condition. Given that Individual Neutral Athletes (a designation often used for athletes from Russia or other countries participating under a neutral flag due to doping bans or other reasons) win a significant number of gold medals, it suggests a strong performance from athletes who are not competing under their national flags. This condition, by itself, doesn't directly influence the number of countries winning their debut gold medal but sets a context of high achievement by a specific group of athletes. 2. Countries winning their debut gold medal: For a country to win its first-ever Olympic gold medal, several factors come into play, including the country's size, investment in sports infrastructure, talent identification and development programs, and participation history in the Olympics. Smaller or less economically developed countries might have less chance of winning gold due to these factors, but there are always exceptions, especially in sports with lower barriers to entry or in new Olympic sports. 3. Paris 2024 Olympics context: The Olympics feature a wide range of sports, and each edition may introduce new sports or events, which can provide fresh opportunities for countries to win medals in areas they hadn't previously been competitive in. Additionally, the global nature of the Olympics means that there's always a possibility for athletes from a wide range of countries to participate and potentially win. Given these considerations, to estimate the probability that at least 5 countries win their debut gold medal under the condition that Individual Neutral Athletes win \u226515 gold medals, we need to consider: - Historical context: It's relatively rare for a large number of countries to win their first gold medal in a single Olympics. While there are always countries winning their first ever gold, the number reaching 5 or more is less common. - Impact of Individual Neutral Athletes: Their success doesn't directly correlate with the success of other countries winning their first gold medals. However, a strong performance by Individual Neutral Athletes might indicate a competitive field where traditional powerhouses are challenged, potentially opening opportunities for newcomers. - Olympic debutants and new sports: The inclusion of new sports and the natural progression of countries improving their Olympic programs can lead to an increase in first-time gold medal winners. Considering these factors, while there's always a chance for new countries to win their first gold medals, the condition of Individual Neutral Athletes winning \u226515 gold medals doesn't directly increase the likelihood of 5 or more countries achieving this feat. The probability, therefore, leans towards being lower rather than higher, given the specificity of the condition and the general rarity of multiple countries winning their first gold in a single Olympics."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "7ec31382-dcd5-4bea-90a0-04b20981b593", "title": "Given Individual Neutral Athletes win fewer than 15 gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, will at least 5 countries win their debut gold medal?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where Individual Neutral Athletes collectively win fewer than 15 gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

Understanding the Question: The question is asking for the probability that, according to 538's national polling average, Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden will be greater than 2 but less than or equal to 3 points on July 15, 2024. 2. Polling Averages Volatility: Polling averages like those provided by 538 can fluctuate over time due to various factors, including new polls being conducted, changes in public opinion, and methodological adjustments. However, these averages tend to be more stable than individual polls because they aggregate data from multiple sources. 3. Time Frame: The question was created in early July 2021, and the resolution date is July 17, 2024. This means there's a significant time gap, and many events could influence the polling averages, including debates, policy announcements, and external factors like economic changes or international events. 4. Election Cycle Dynamics: Early in the election cycle, polling can be less predictive of the final outcome. As the election draws closer, polls may become more reflective of the eventual result, but they can still be influenced by various factors, including campaign strategies and voter turnout efforts. 5. Specificity of the Range: The question specifies a narrow range (greater than 2 but less than or equal to 3 points) for Trump's lead. Given the potential for fluctuations in polling averages, predicting such a specific outcome far in advance is challenging.

First, we need to understand the condition: Sifan Hassan winning a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Sifan Hassan is a highly accomplished middle- and long-distance runner, so it's plausible she could win a medal. However, the main question focuses on whether Kalenjin athletes will win both the men's and women's marathon races under the condition that Sifan Hassan wins any medal. The Kalenjin people are an ethnic group from Kenya known for producing a significant number of world-class distance runners. Their success in long-distance running is attributed to a combination of genetic, environmental, and cultural factors. Given their dominance in distance running, it's reasonable to consider that Kalenjin athletes could win both marathon races. However, winning both the men's and women's marathon races at the Olympics is a very specific outcome that depends on numerous factors, including the competition, course conditions, and individual athlete performance on the day of the race. While Kalenjin athletes have a strong track record in distance running, other athletes from different backgrounds also have the potential to win. Additionally, Sifan Hassan's performance and potential medal win in her events (which are not specified but presumably could range from 1500 meters to 10,000 meters) do not directly influence the outcomes of the marathon races. The condition of her winning a medal serves as a starting point for the question but does not causally affect the likelihood of Kalenjin athletes winning the marathons. Given these considerations, the probability of Kalenjin athletes winning both the men's and women's marathon races under the condition of Sifan Hassan winning any medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics would be influenced by the historical dominance of Kalenjin athletes in distance running. However, because winning both races is a very specific outcome and subject to a wide range of variables, the probability should be considered cautiously."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "049a7e09-8424-42f8-a471-7332da3a94a8", "title": "Conditional on Sifan Hassan failing to win a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, will Kalenjin athletes win both the men's and women's marathon races?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Sifan Hassan does not win any medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Prevalence of Kalenjin Athletes in Long-Distance Running: Athletes from the Kalenjin people, an ethnic group from Kenya, have historically dominated long-distance running events, including marathons. This dominance is attributed to a combination of genetic predisposition, cultural factors, and the high-altitude training environment in Kenya. 2. Competition and Athlete Pool: The Olympic marathon is one of the most competitive events in athletics, drawing elite runners from around the world. Despite the strong presence of Kalenjin athletes, other runners from various backgrounds also have a significant chance of winning. 3. Sifan Hassan's Participation and Its Impact: The condition that Sifan Hassan does not win any medal somewhat simplifies our scenario since we do not have to account for her potential victory. However, her participation or lack thereof in the marathon (assuming she might focus on other events) could slightly alter the competitive landscape, though it's unlikely to significantly impact the odds of Kalenjin athletes winning. 4. Recent Trends and Performances: In recent years, while Kalenjin athletes have continued to perform exceptionally well, athletes from other countries, including Ethiopia, Uganda, and the United States, have also shown strong performances in marathon events. 5. Event-Specific Uncertainties: Each marathon event is unique, with outcomes influenced by the specific course, weather conditions, athlete health, and race strategy. These variables can sometimes favor underdogs or athletes who might not have been the favorites to win. Given these considerations, while Kalenjin athletes have a strong historical advantage in marathon events, predicting a double win with certainty is challenging due to the high level of competition and the numerous variables that can affect the outcome of a marathon. Therefore, considering the historical dominance of Kalenjin athletes but also acknowledging the competitive nature of the Olympic marathon and the uncertainties involved in any sports event, I would estimate the probability of Kalenjin athletes winning both the men's and women's marathon races at the 2024 Paris Olympics, given Sifan Hassan does not win any medal, as follows:"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.011797865372138894, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0029494663430347234, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17219638141716362, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

'House of the Dragon' S2E8 Being Rated >8.5 on IMDB: IMDB ratings are user-generated and can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including but not limited to the episode's quality, fan expectations, and the overall popularity of the series. A rating of >8.5 indicates a very positive reception. Reasoning: The two events ('Trap' receiving a B- or lower CinemaScore and 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 being rated >8.5 on IMDB) are largely independent. The success or failure of one does not directly impact the other, as they are in different media formats (film vs. television series episode) and genres, and appeal to potentially different audiences. The conditionality of 'Trap' receiving a B- or lower does not provide information about the quality or expected reception of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8. The reception of a TV episode is influenced by its writing, acting, direction, and how well it meets fan expectations, among other factors, none of which are directly tied to the audience response to a different film. 'House of the Dragon' is a popular series with a dedicated fan base. Season finales often receive high ratings if they meet or exceed fan expectations, providing closure or setting up future storylines effectively. Given the lack of direct connection between the two and considering the general popularity of 'House of the Dragon,' the probability that S2E8 will be rated >8.5 on IMDB, conditional on 'Trap' receiving a B- or lower CinemaScore, leans towards being somewhat positive but should be tempered by the recognition that achieving a rating >8.5 is challenging and dependent on many factors."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.09763835943980331, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The question specifically asks whether ISS will advise against Elon Musk's $57 billion package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk to the Tesla board of directors. To make an informed prediction, we need to consider ISS's past behavior and guidelines on executive compensation and board composition. In recent years, ISS has taken a more critical stance on executive compensation, particularly when it comes to large pay packages. In 2020, ISS recommended that Tesla shareholders vote against Elon Musk's pay package, citing concerns over its size and structure. However, it's worth noting that ISS's recommendations are not always followed by shareholders, and Musk's pay package was ultimately approved. Regarding Kimbal Musk's re-election, ISS has generally supported the re-election of incumbent directors who have a track record of good governance and oversight. However, ISS may take a closer look at Kimbal Musk's performance and independence, given his familial relationship with Elon Musk. Assuming Donald Trump Jr. is not the Republican nominee, it's unlikely that this will have a direct impact on ISS's recommendations regarding Elon Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election. ISS's decisions are typically based on its own guidelines and analysis of the company's governance and performance. Given ISS's past behavior and guidelines, it's possible that they may recommend against Elon Musk's pay package, particularly if it's deemed excessive or not aligned with the company's performance.

Ongoing Investigation: The question pertains to an ongoing investigation, The State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump, et al, which suggests there is already a legal framework within which charges could be brought. This indicates a higher likelihood of action compared to a scenario where no investigation was underway. 2. Previous Actions by Trump: There have been numerous reports and allegations of Donald Trump attempting to influence or intimidate witnesses in various legal matters, including this case. Such behavior, if proven, could constitute witness tampering. 3. Legal Definition of Witness Tampering: Witness tampering involves interfering with a witness\u2019s testimony or cooperation in a legal proceeding. If Trump has made statements that could be interpreted as attempting to influence potential witnesses, this could form the basis of a charge. 4. Prosecutorial Discretion: The decision to charge someone with a crime, especially a high-profile individual like a former President, involves significant prosecutorial discretion. Prosecutors must weigh the evidence, the likelihood of securing a conviction, and the public interest in pursuing charges. 5. Political Considerations: The charging of a former President is inherently political. While the law should be applied impartially, the reality is that such a decision would have significant political repercussions and might be influenced by considerations beyond the strict legal merits of the case. 6. Timeline: The question specifies a deadline of June 1, 2024. The closer we get to this date without charges being filed, the less likely it becomes that charges will be brought before the deadline, given the time required to prepare and file indictments. Considering these factors, it's clear that there is a plausible basis for charges to be brought against Donald Trump for witness tampering, given the context of the ongoing investigation and previous allegations of attempts to influence witnesses. However, the decision to bring charges is complex and influenced by both legal and political considerations. Given the information available up to the creation of this question in August 2023, and without updates on the investigation's progress or specific evidence that might have come to light since, it's challenging to assign a precise probability.

The value of USD/JPY is determined by various economic factors, including interest rates, inflation, and trade balances, whereas Joe Biden's decision is influenced by his personal and political considerations. Secondly, there is no clear logical connection between the value of USD/JPY and Joe Biden's decision to drop out and resign. The value of USD/JPY may fluctuate due to various economic factors, but it is unlikely to have a direct impact on Joe Biden's decision. Lastly, Joe Biden has not shown any indication of dropping out of the presidential election or resigning from office. As the incumbent president, he has a strong base of support and is likely to continue his campaign for re-election.

First, let's analyze the condition given in the question. The value of the USD relative to the JPY on August 9th, 2024, is a specific economic indicator that may or may not have a direct impact on Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the election and resign. There is no clear or obvious connection between the two events. The value of the USD relative to the JPY is influenced by a wide range of economic factors, including monetary policy, trade balances, and market sentiment. It's not clear how or why this specific economic indicator would directly influence Joe Biden's decision-making. Second, let's consider the timing of the events. The condition is based on the value of the USD/JPY on August 9th, 2024, but the announcement from Joe Biden must be made before the end of July 2024. This means that the condition is based on a future event that has not yet occurred, and it's unclear how or why Joe Biden would make a decision based on a future event that has not yet happened. Finally, let's consider the broader context. Presidential elections and resignations are significant events that are influenced by a wide range of factors, including politics, policy, and personal considerations. While economic indicators can certainly play a role in shaping the political landscape, it's unlikely that a single economic indicator like the USD/JPY exchange rate would be the sole or primary driver of a decision as significant as dropping out of a presidential election and resigning. Given these considerations, it seems unlikely that Joe Biden would announce that he is dropping out of the election and resigning before the end of July 2024, based solely on the condition that the USD is worth less than 145 JPY at close on August 9th, 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.11640918750497978, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Understanding the Movies Involved: - Deadpool (2016): This was a groundbreaking film for its R-rated humor, unique storytelling, and the popularity of the character Deadpool, played by Ryan Reynolds. It had a surprisingly successful opening weekend, largely due to its fresh take on the superhero genre and strong marketing campaign. - The Wolverine (2013): This film, starring Hugh Jackman, was part of the X-Men film series and focused on Wolverine's character. While it received mixed reviews, it still performed well at the box office, thanks to the established fan base of the X-Men series and Wolverine's character. - Deadpool & Wolverine: This upcoming film brings together two of the most beloved characters from the X-Men universe.

Box Office Trends: - Superhero movies have consistently shown strong box office performances over the years, with many achieving record-breaking openings. - The combination of Deadpool's irreverent humor and Wolverine's broad appeal could attract a large audience, potentially exceeding the individual performances of their solo films. 3. Marketing and Hype: - The marketing campaign for \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" will likely be extensive, given the popularity of the characters involved. A well-executed campaign could significantly boost the film's opening weekend numbers. - Fan anticipation for this film is high, considering it brings together two fan-favorite characters in what could be an exciting and unique storyline. 4. Competition and Release Timing: - The release date of the film could impact its opening weekend. If it's released during a less crowded period or when there's less competition from other major films, it could perform better. Considering these factors, the combination of Deadpool and Wolverine in a single film has the potential to draw in a massive audience, leveraging the strengths and fan bases of both characters. The overall trend of superhero movies performing exceptionally well at the box office, combined with effective marketing and the unique appeal of this film, suggests a strong potential for its opening weekend.

Iceland has had a mixed history in Eurovision, with some successful qualifications to the Grand Final but also some non-qualifications. The country has shown a capacity to produce competitive entries, but the highly variable nature of the contest means that success can depend on many factors, including the quality of the song, the performance, and the voting dynamics of the specific year. Given the information available up to the creation of this question (April 12, 2024), we do not know the specifics of Iceland's entry for Eurovision 2024, such as the artist, song, or staging details, which are crucial for making a more accurate prediction. However, considering Iceland's general track record and the unpredictable nature of Eurovision, a reasonable approach is to start with a baseline probability that reflects the average qualification rate for countries in a similar position. In recent years, about half of the countries participating in the Semi-finals have qualified for the Grand Final, but this rate can be influenced by various factors, including the strength of the competition, the composition of the voting juries, and the public's voting patterns. Without specific details on Iceland's entry, it's challenging to adjust this baseline probability significantly upwards or downwards. Therefore, based on historical averages and the inherent uncertainty of the contest, a cautious estimate would place Iceland's chances of qualifying for the Grand Final at around the average qualification rate of countries in the Semi-finals, acknowledging that this is a broad generalization and actual chances could vary based on the specifics of their entry and performance."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "bfdc227e-ee1f-4c5c-b86d-a1ded892ec14", "title": "Will Ireland qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Ireland participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Since the introduction of the semi-final format in 2004, Ireland has failed to qualify for the final on several occasions, but they have also had successes. This mixed record suggests that while they have the potential to do well, qualification is not guaranteed. 2.

Without knowing who will represent Ireland in 2024 and what the song will be, it's difficult to assess this factor accurately. However, Ireland has shown an ability to select competitive entries in the past. 3. Competition and Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by various factors, including geographical location, cultural ties, and the order of performance. Ireland benefits from being a well-known participant with a large diaspora, but the competition is fierce, with many countries employing sophisticated strategies to maximize their chances. 4. Recent Trends: In recent years, there has been a trend towards more contemporary and experimental songs doing well, alongside a continued preference for strong vocal performances and memorable staging. If Ireland can tap into these trends, their chances of qualifying could improve.

First, for Joe Biden to announce that he is dropping out of the presidential race before the end of July 2024, it would be a significant political move. While it's not unprecedented for candidates to drop out of races, doing so would suggest a major shift in Biden's political strategy or a response to unforeseen circumstances. Given the stakes and the timing, this alone is a low-probability event, especially without clear indicators of such an intention as of my last update. Second, for a sitting U.S. President to announce their resignation is an even more extraordinary event. Presidential resignations are extremely rare in U.S. history, with Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974 being the most recent example. Such an action would typically be precipitated by severe political, legal, or personal crises. As of my last update, there's no public information suggesting President Biden is facing circumstances that would lead to such a drastic decision. Considering both events need to happen together as per the question (Joe Biden announcing he is dropping out of the race and resigning from the presidency before the end of July 2024), the combined probability is even lower than that of either event happening in isolation. This is because for both to occur, the circumstances would have to be exceptionally compelling, far beyond what is typically seen in political life.

Understanding the Premise: The premise here is that the Democratic Party selects a female presidential nominee for the 2024 election. This information is crucial because it sets a specific context that might influence the Republican Party's choice of nominee, potentially due to strategic considerations or as a response to the Democratic nominee's profile. 2. Will Hurd's Profile: Will Hurd is a former CIA officer and a Republican who served in the U.S. House of Representatives. He has been known for his relatively moderate stance within the Republican Party, which could potentially make him an appealing candidate in a general election, especially against a Democratic nominee who might be perceived as more extreme or divisive. 3. Republican Nomination Process: The Republican Party's nomination process involves primaries and caucuses across the United States, culminating in the Republican National Convention, where delegates officially select the party's nominee. The process is influenced by a variety of factors, including the candidates' popularity among the party base, their fundraising capabilities, and their perceived viability in the general election. 4. Impact of a Female Democratic Nominee: The selection of a female nominee by the Democratic Party could influence the Republican Party's choice in several ways. It might lead to a strategic decision to nominate a candidate who can effectively counter the narrative and appeal of the Democratic nominee. However, the Republican Party's choice is more directly influenced by internal party dynamics, the preferences of its base, and the outcomes of the primaries and caucuses. 5. Will Hurd's Chances: Given the complex dynamics of the Republican nomination process and the factors that influence it, Will Hurd's chances of being selected as the nominee would depend on a multitude of factors, including his performance in the primaries, his fundraising success, and his appeal to the broader Republican base. The fact that the Democratic nominee is a woman does not directly impact Hurd's chances in a significant way, as the Republican Party's decision is primarily driven by internal considerations. Considering these points, the probability of Will Hurd being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, given that the Democratic nominee is a woman, is low. This is because the Republican Party's nomination process is influenced by a wide array of factors, and while Hurd's moderate stance might be beneficial in a general election, it does not necessarily give him a significant advantage in the nomination process."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "57318733-a4c9-498c-a1f8-87fc5eca30dd", "title": "If the 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee is a man, will Will Hurd be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The Democratic delegates select a male presidential nominee for the 2024 election.

Past Interviews: Biden has had interviews that qualify, such as his appearance on The Howard Stern Show, which lasted approximately 70 minutes.

Meta's Commitment to Safety: Meta, like other major tech companies involved in AI development, has been under scrutiny for the safety and ethical implications of its AI models. Given this scrutiny and the growing importance of AI safety, it's reasonable to assume that Meta has a vested interest in demonstrating its commitment to these issues. 2. Red-Teaming: Red-teaming is a process where a group (often external and independent) simulates an adversary to test the defenses and robustness of a system\u2014in this case, an AI model. This is a recognized method for identifying vulnerabilities and improving the safety and security of AI models. The external aspect is crucial as it brings an unbiased perspective and potentially more rigorous testing. 3. Publication of Results: The publication of results from such an exercise would serve multiple purposes for Meta. It would demonstrate transparency regarding the safety of their AI models, contribute to the broader field of AI safety, and potentially preempt regulatory scrutiny by showing proactive engagement with safety concerns. 4. Timeline: The question specifies a deadline of June 30, 2024. Given the pace of development in AI and the increasing focus on safety, it's plausible that Meta would prioritize such an initiative within this timeframe, especially if they have already begun or are planning to start the process of external red-teaming. Considering these points, it seems likely that Meta would engage in external red-teaming of their models and publish the results. This aligns with the broader industry trends towards greater transparency and proactivity in addressing AI safety concerns. The specified timeline seems reasonable for such an endeavor, given the current pace of AI development and the increasing importance of safety and ethics in AI."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d7bd97df-f02e-4f21-92e9-248bfd5f1bd2", "title": "Will Anthropic publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, Anthropic publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T05:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.8, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To answer this question, let's break it down into components that can help us estimate the probability of Anthropic publishing a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024. 1. Anthropic's Focus on Safety: Anthropic is known for its emphasis on AI safety. The company has been vocal about the importance of developing safe and responsible AI systems. This focus suggests that they are likely to engage in efforts to rigorously test and evaluate the safety of their models, including through external red-teaming. 2. Red-Teaming as a Safety Measure: Red-teaming is a practice where a team (often external) simulates adversarial attacks or attempts to find vulnerabilities in a system. Given its effectiveness in uncovering potential issues, it's plausible that Anthropic would employ this method as part of their safety protocols. 3. Publication of Safety Reports: Companies focused on AI safety, like Anthropic, often publish reports and research findings related to the safety and security of their models. This transparency helps build trust and contributes to the broader discussion on AI safety within the research community. 4. Timeline and Feasibility: The deadline given is June 30, 2024. Considering the current pace of development in AI and the emphasis on safety, it's reasonable to assume that Anthropic could conduct and publish the results of external red-teaming within this timeframe. Given these considerations, the probability that Anthropic will publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, seems relatively high. The company's focus on safety, the value of red-teaming in ensuring safety, the practice of publishing safety-related findings, and the feasibility of the timeline all contribute to this assessment."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "a03a7d3a-c5d3-4fe3-9f0f-75ff08dde789", "title": "Conditional on Anthropic publishing a report with results from external red-teaming by June 30, 2024, will Meta do the same?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: By June 30, 2024, Anthropic publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.
