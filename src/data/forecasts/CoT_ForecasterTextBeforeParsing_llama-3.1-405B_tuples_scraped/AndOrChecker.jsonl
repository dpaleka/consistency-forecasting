Firstly, it's essential to note that the Republican Party's nomination process typically involves a combination of primary elections and caucuses, followed by the Republican National Convention, where delegates from each state gather to officially nominate their candidate. The nominee is usually the candidate who has secured the majority of the delegates during the primary elections and caucuses. Now, let's assess Donald Trump Jr.'s chances of becoming the Republican nominee. While he is the son of former President Donald Trump and has been involved in politics, he has not held any elected office and lacks significant political experience. However, he has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party and has built a strong following among some conservative groups. That being said, the Republican Party has a deep bench of potential candidates for the 2024 presidential election, including former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and several current and former governors and senators. Many of these individuals have more extensive political experience and stronger national profiles than Donald Trump Jr. Furthermore, while Donald Trump Jr. has been mentioned as a possible candidate, he has not yet announced his intention to run for the presidency. His father, former President Trump, has also hinted at potentially running again in 2024, which could significantly impact the nomination process. Considering these factors, it seems unlikely that Donald Trump Jr. will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. While he has some support within the party, he faces significant competition from more experienced and prominent candidates."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e182acfe-2dea-425f-afca-37a2fe27e1c8", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Fundraising and Campaign Infrastructure: The ability to raise funds and build a strong campaign infrastructure is crucial. Cruz has shown capability in this area in the past, but the competition in 2024 could be fierce. 5.

However, if the polls show her performing worse, her odds could decrease. 2. Campaign Events: Significant campaign events, such as debates, rallies, or endorsements, could positively or negatively impact her odds, depending on how they are received by the public and the media. 3. Opponent's Performance: If her opponents experience scandals, gaffes, or other negative events, Kamala Harris's odds could increase by comparison. 4. Economic or Political Developments: Major economic or political developments could influence voter sentiment and, consequently, her odds. Given the short timeframe (one week), it's unlikely that there will be a significant shift in her odds without a major event or a series of polls showing a substantial change in public opinion. However, the question only asks for an increase, not a major increase, and a small increase could be due to a variety of minor factors.

Legal Grounds: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that no person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. 2. Application to Donald Trump: For this clause to apply to Donald Trump, it would need to be proven that he engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or gave aid or comfort to the enemies thereof, after having taken an oath to support the Constitution. The events of January 6, 2021, and Trump's actions and statements around that time could potentially be considered under this clause, but it would require a legal determination. 3. Legal Process and Timing: Any attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would likely involve court proceedings. Given the slow pace of the legal system, it's uncertain whether such a process could be completed by July 15, 2024, especially considering potential appeals. 4. Political Considerations: The decision to pursue removal under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment would also be influenced by political considerations. Given the polarized nature of U.S. politics, it's uncertain whether there would be sufficient political will to pursue such a course of action. 5. State Actions: The question specifies removal from the ballot of any U.S. state. Different states might have different approaches to this issue, and it's possible that some states might attempt to remove Trump while others do not. Given these considerations, while there is a theoretical basis for Donald Trump's removal from a primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the practical and political hurdles make it uncertain."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6a0c7b39-0a89-43ef-9992-6328976e5448", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

His popularity among a substantial segment of Republican voters remains high, which could be a strong factor in his favor. 2. **Current Political Climate**: The political landscape is highly polarized, with Trump remaining a central figure in Republican politics. His influence over a considerable portion of the Republican base is undeniable, which could give him an edge in primary elections. 3. **Potential Competitors**: The field of potential Republican candidates for 2024 is broad and includes several notable figures. However, Trump's name recognition, existing base of support, and experience in navigating the nomination process could give him an advantage over competitors. 4. **Nomination Process**: The Republican National Convention's delegate selection process is crucial. Trump's ability to mobilize his base could lead to significant delegate support, which is key to securing the nomination. 5. **Legal and Health Factors**: As of my last update, there were ongoing legal matters and health concerns surrounding Trump. While these factors could potentially impact his candidacy, Trump has historically shown resilience in the face of controversy.

Current Political Context: As of my last update, there was no widely known or imminent plan for Vice President Kamala Harris to assume the presidency or acting presidency. The transition of power typically occurs due to the current president's inability to serve (due to resignation, incapacitation, or death) or at the end of a presidential term through election. 2. Health and Stability of the Current President: Without specific information on the health or stability of President Joe Biden as of the market's creation or resolution dates, we must assume that there are no publicly known immediate threats to his ability to serve. The president's health and well-being are closely monitored, and any significant concerns would likely be public knowledge. 3. Historical Precedents: The assumption of the presidency by the vice president outside of a regular election cycle is a rare event. It has happened a total of nine times in U.S. history, with the most recent instance being Gerald Ford's assumption of the presidency after Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974. These transitions are typically unexpected and occur under extraordinary circumstances. 4.

Regarding scenario (a), it's essential to understand the context of the 14th Amendment and its application. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort to its enemies, are ineligible to hold federal or state office. The clause was originally intended to prevent former Confederates from holding public office after the Civil War. In recent years, there have been discussions and debates about applying the 14th Amendment to individuals involved in the January 6, 2021, storming of the US Capitol or other activities deemed as insurrectionary. However, the process of removing someone from a primary ballot under the 14th Amendment is complex and would likely involve lengthy legal battles. Given the lack of clear precedent and the potential for protracted legal challenges, it's uncertain whether Donald Trump would be removed from a primary ballot under the 14th Amendment. However, considering the ongoing investigations and controversies surrounding Trump's actions, it's not impossible that some state or federal authority might attempt to invoke the 14th Amendment. Regarding scenario (b), Ted Cruz's chances of becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election depend on various factors, including the outcome of primary elections, party dynamics, and delegate selection. While Cruz has a dedicated base and has run for president before, the Republican field is likely to be crowded, and other candidates may have stronger support or more momentum. Assessing the probability of either scenario (a) or scenario (b) occurring is challenging, but based on current information and trends, I would estimate the probability as follows: Probability: 0.25. This estimate reflects a relatively low but non-negligible chance of either scenario occurring. The probability is not extremely low because there are ongoing investigations and controversies surrounding Trump, and Cruz has a dedicated base and previous experience running for president. However, the probability is not high because the process of removing someone from a primary ballot under the 14th Amendment is complex, and the Republican field is likely to be crowded, making it uncertain whether Cruz will emerge as the nominee."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.029092640274730772, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

While Nikki Haley has announced her candidacy, the field is expected to be crowded, including potentially high-profile candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others. 2. Nikki Haley's Profile: Nikki Haley has a strong resume, having served as the Governor of South Carolina and the United States Ambassador to the United Nations under President Trump. Her experience in both domestic and foreign policy could appeal to a broad spectrum of Republican voters. 3. Primary Election Dynamics: The Republican primary process is complex, involving multiple states with different demographics and political priorities. Success in the primaries often depends on a candidate's ability to connect with the party's base, fundraise effectively, and navigate the media landscape. 4. Polling and Predictive Models: Early polls and predictive models for the 2024 Republican nomination have shown varying levels of support for Haley, but they generally indicate that she faces significant competition, particularly from Trump and potentially DeSantis. 5. Historical Context: Historically, Republican primaries have been unpredictable, with the eventual nominee not always being the early frontrunner. The party has shown a willingness to nominate candidates who may not have been the establishment's first choice.

Historical Context and Party Trends: The Republican Party has shown a tendency to nominate candidates who are either establishment figures or have significant name recognition. Both Mike Pence, as the former Vice President under Donald Trump, and Nikki Haley, as the former Governor of South Carolina and UN Ambassador, fit these criteria to varying degrees. 2. Primary Process and Delegate Selection: The Republican nomination process is determined by a series of state primaries and caucuses, culminating in the Republican National Convention. Candidates must appeal to a broad base of Republican voters and navigate the complexities of delegate allocation, which can sometimes favor establishment candidates. 3. Current Field of Candidates and Potential Entrants: As of the last update, the field for the 2024 Republican nomination is not fully set, with several potential candidates considering a run. The dynamics of the primary can significantly change depending on who decides to enter the race. Donald Trump, if he decides to run again, could significantly alter the landscape, potentially making it more challenging for other candidates to gain traction. 4. Personal and Political Factors: Mike Pence's close association with Donald Trump could be both a boon and a bane, depending on Trump's popularity within the party at the time of the primaries. Nikki Haley has attempted to position herself as a figure who can bridge different factions within the party, but her success in doing so remains to be seen. 5. Fundraising and Support: The ability to raise funds and garner support from key figures within the party and from donors will be crucial. Both Pence and Haley have shown an ability to fundraise, but the extent of their support can vary widely as the election season progresses. Given these considerations, while both Mike Pence and Nikki Haley are plausible candidates, the field is highly unpredictable, especially with the potential for Donald Trump or other strong candidates to enter the race. The Republican Party's nomination process can be volatile, with many factors influencing the outcome, including voter sentiment, fundraising, and the strategic maneuvering of potential candidates.

Competition: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 election includes figures closely aligned with the party's current direction, such as those who have more recently held or currently hold office and have been more vocal about populist and conservative issues. Christie would face stiff competition from these candidates, who might be perceived as more in tune with the party's base. 4.

While this keeps him in the public eye, it might not necessarily translate to broad support within the Republican Party, especially if his views are seen as divergent from the party's mainstream. 5.

Firstly, Donald Trump has been a dominant figure in the Republican Party since his presidency. Despite losing the 2020 election, he maintains a strong base of supporters within the party. His influence over the party and his ability to mobilize his base could make him a strong contender for the nomination. Glenn Youngkin, on the other hand, is a relatively new figure in national politics. He won the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, which could be seen as an indicator of his potential for broader appeal. However, his national recognition and support within the Republican Party are not as widespread as Trump's. Historically, the Republican Party has shown a tendency to nominate candidates who have run previously or have strong name recognition. This trend could favor Trump, who has already run for and won the presidency. However, the party also has a history of seeking new faces, especially after losing an election, which could open the door for Youngkin or other candidates. Considering these factors, the competition for the Republican nomination is likely to be intense, with multiple candidates vying for the spot. While Trump's influence and base make him a strong contender, the desire for new leadership and the potential for other candidates to rise in prominence could challenge his nomination. Youngkin, while a viable candidate, faces the challenge of building national recognition and support to compete effectively against Trump and any other contenders. Given these considerations, the probability that either Glenn Youngkin or Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee seems relatively high due to Trump's strong presence and the possibility of Youngkin or another candidate gaining momentum. However, the uncertainty of political contests, the long time frame until the election, and the potential for new candidates to emerge mean that this probability is not a certainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.013177300829938652, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Understanding the Republican Nomination Process: The Republican Party's nomination process for the presidential election involves a series of primary elections and caucuses in each state, culminating in the Republican National Convention. Delegates from each state, chosen during the primaries and caucuses, attend the convention and vote to select the party's nominees for president and vice president. 2. Francis Suarez's Candidacy: Francis Suarez is the current Mayor of Miami, Florida. While he has been mentioned as a potential candidate for higher office, his national profile and political experience are not as extensive as some other potential candidates. His path to the nomination would require significant momentum and support from the Republican base, which is challenging given the crowded field of more established candidates. 3. Nikki Haley's Candidacy: Nikki Haley, a former Governor of South Carolina and the United States Ambassador to the United Nations under President Donald Trump, has a higher national profile and more political experience compared to Suarez. She has been considered a potential candidate for the Republican nomination in the past and has broader appeal within the party. However, she would still face stiff competition from other prominent candidates. 4. The Likelihood of Both Being Nominated: For both Suarez and Haley to be nominated, they would need to outcompete other candidates in the primaries and gain substantial support from the delegates at the Republican National Convention. The Republican Party often selects a presidential and vice-presidential candidate who complement each other in terms of political experience, geographical appeal, and ideological stance. While it's not impossible for two less traditional candidates to be nominated, the odds are against them, especially considering the competitive nature of the Republican primaries. 5. Historical Context and Party Dynamics: Historically, the Republican Party has often chosen nominees with significant political experience and national recognition. The dynamics within the party, including the influence of former President Trump and the factional divisions, could also impact the nomination process in unpredictable ways. Given these considerations, the probability of both Francis Suarez and Nikki Haley being selected as the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election is low. The competition within the party, the need for broad appeal, and the historical context of the nomination process all suggest that other candidates are more likely to secure the nominations."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "1b437376-85ec-49eb-af72-4914d6904f3e", "title": "Will either Francis Suarez or Nikki Haley be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Francis Suarez or Nikki Haley is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Despite losing the 2020 election, he has maintained a strong base of support within the party. Donald Trump Jr., while not having held public office, is also a significant figure within the party due to his family ties and active political engagement. 2. Republican Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has shown a strong inclination towards Trumpism since 2016. Many of the party's candidates and elected officials have aligned themselves with Trump's policies and rhetoric to varying degrees. This suggests a favorable environment for a Trump nomination. 3. Potential Challengers: While there are other significant figures within the Republican Party who could potentially challenge Trump for the nomination (e.g., former Vice President Mike Pence, Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida), Trump's current standing and influence within the party make him a formidable candidate. 4. Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s Prospects: Although Donald Trump Jr. has been mentioned as a potential candidate, his prospects are less clear compared to his father. He lacks the same level of political experience and broad recognition. However, his alignment with his father's policies and his active role in the Trump campaign could make him a contender in a scenario where his father does not run. 5. Legal and Health Considerations: As of the last update, there are ongoing investigations and legal proceedings involving Donald Trump. These factors, along with health considerations for any candidate, could impact his ability or decision to run. 6. Election and Party Trends: The Republican Party has historically shown a tendency to favor candidates who have run previously or have strong name recognition. This trend could support either Trump's nomination or, to a lesser extent, Donald Trump Jr.'s, should he decide to run and gain significant traction. Considering these factors, the most likely scenario is that either Donald Trump or, less likely, Donald Trump Jr. could secure the Republican nomination, given their current influence and standing within the party.

The Indian National Congress (INC) has been one of the dominant political parties in India since independence. However, in recent years, the party has faced significant challenges, including internal leadership issues, electoral losses, and the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a formidable opponent. The BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been in power since 2014 and has maintained a strong grip on national politics. Several factors will influence the outcome of the 2024 general election: 1. Current Political Trends: The BJP has been winning state elections and has shown resilience in maintaining its voter base. The INC, on the other hand, has struggled to regain lost ground. 2. Leadership: The INC's leadership, particularly Rahul Gandhi, has faced criticism for not being able to effectively counter the BJP's electoral strategies. The perception of leadership within the INC and its ability to inspire confidence among voters will be crucial. 3. Alliances and Coalitions: The formation of alliances and coalitions with regional parties could significantly impact the INC's chances. Successful alliances could help the INC gain more seats, but the party has had mixed results in managing such partnerships. 4. Economic and Social Issues: The state of the economy, unemployment, agricultural issues, and social harmony will influence voter sentiment. The INC will need to present a compelling vision to address these concerns to win over voters. 5. Campaign Strategy and Election Machinery: The effectiveness of the INC's campaign strategy, including its use of social media, grassroots mobilization, and the ability to counter the BJP's narrative, will play a significant role. Considering these factors, while the INC has the potential to improve its performance from the last election, the path to forming the government seems challenging.

Indian National Congress (INC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Dominance: Historically, the INC and BJP have been the two major parties dominating Indian politics. They have the largest voter bases, the most widespread organizational structures, and the most significant financial resources. This historical dominance suggests a high likelihood of one of these parties forming the government. 2. Current Political Landscape: As of the last update in 2022, the BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been in power since 2014. The party has maintained a strong political presence and has a significant base of support. The INC, on the other hand, has been trying to regain its footing after losing power in 2014. Despite this, it remains the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian Parliament). 3. Electoral System: India's electoral system is based on a first-past-the-post system for the Lok Sabha elections. This system tends to favor larger parties with broad appeal over smaller, regional parties. This further increases the likelihood of either the INC or BJP winning a majority or forming a coalition government. 4. Coalition Politics: Indian politics has seen a trend of coalition governments, especially when no single party achieves a clear majority. Both the INC and BJP have previously led coalition governments. Their ability to form alliances with other parties is crucial in a scenario where they don't achieve an outright majority. 5. Regional Parties: While regional parties play a significant role in their respective states, their influence at the national level is limited. However, they can be crucial in forming coalitions. The INC and BJP have historically been able to attract regional parties into their coalitions, further solidifying their chances of forming the government. 6. Public Sentiment and Campaigns: Public sentiment, campaign strategies, and leadership appeal can significantly influence election outcomes. However, predicting these factors far in advance is challenging. Both parties have shown the ability to mobilize large-scale campaigns and connect with their voter bases. Considering these factors, while there is a possibility of a third front or a coalition of smaller parties, the historical dominance, organizational strength, and coalition-building capabilities of the INC and BJP make it likely that one of them will form the government after the 2024 general election."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.001924223582381139, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00048105589559528476, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.06602422212782971, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This experience could potentially aid him in future campaigns, understanding the process, and building a foundation of supporters. 2. Current Political Climate: The political landscape in the United States is highly polarized, and the popularity of candidates can fluctuate rapidly. Cruz has maintained a strong conservative stance, which appeals to a significant portion of the Republican base. However, his appeal to moderates and independents might be limited compared to other potential candidates. 3. Competition within the Republican Party: As of my last update, several other prominent Republicans have been mentioned as potential candidates for the 2024 election, including Donald Trump, if he decides to run again. The competition within the party could be fierce, and Cruz would need to differentiate himself and convince delegates that he is the best choice to represent the party. 4. Fundraising and Campaign Infrastructure: Cruz has shown the ability to raise significant funds for his campaigns in the past, which is a crucial factor in the success of a presidential bid. However, the fundraising landscape can change, and other candidates might outperform him in this area. 5. Public Perception and Polls: Public perception of Cruz is divided, with strong supporters and detractors. His chances would depend on how he is perceived by the broader Republican electorate and whether he can attract new supporters beyond his current base. Considering these factors, while Ted Cruz has a dedicated base and significant experience, the competition for the Republican nomination is likely to be intense. His ability to win the nomination would depend on various factors, including the dynamics of the primary race, the strategies of his competitors, and how well he can build support among a broad range of Republican voters and delegates."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "b7c83e33-eff7-4872-bca2-38a395299fdc", "title": "Will Ron DeSantis be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Ron DeSantis is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, both Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis have established themselves as prominent figures within the Republican Party. Ted Cruz, a senator from Texas, has previously run for the Republican nomination in 2016, where he was the second-to-last candidate standing before losing to Donald Trump. This experience, combined with his strong conservative credentials, makes him a viable candidate for the nomination in 2024. Ron DeSantis, the current governor of Florida, has gained national attention for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his proactive approach to conservative policies. His popularity among Republican voters has increased significantly, positioning him as a strong contender for the nomination.

The Olympics often feature new sports or events, which can increase the chances for smaller or less experienced countries to win medals. 2. Debutants and First-Time Winners: The Olympic Games frequently welcome new participants. Countries that have recently gained independence, smaller nations that have been improving their sports infrastructure, or countries that have never participated in certain sports before have potential for first-time wins. 3. Paris 2024 Specifics: The 2024 Paris Olympics will introduce new sports and events, such as breakdancing, sport climbing, skateboarding, and surfing. These additions provide opportunities for countries that might not have traditional Olympic sports infrastructures to compete and potentially win medals. 4. Globalization of Sports: The globalization of sports and increased investment in sports development programs across the world have led to a more diverse pool of competitors. This trend suggests that more countries could achieve their first Olympic success. 5.

First, let's consider the probability of Joe Biden's death before the specified date. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at Biden's current health and age. As of my knowledge cutoff, Joe Biden is 81 years old, which puts him in a higher risk category for mortality. However, he has been generally healthy, and there has been no recent indication of severe illness. Given his age and health, I would estimate the probability of his death before the specified date as low, likely less than 1%. Next, let's consider the probability of the Democratic delegates selecting a female presidential nominee for the 2024 election. This event is more uncertain and depends on various factors, including the candidates' popularity, party dynamics, and the outcome of the primaries. However, we can look at the current pool of potential candidates and the Democratic Party's recent trends. As of my knowledge cutoff, there are several strong female candidates, and the party has shown a willingness to nominate women for high-level positions. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of a female nominee as moderate, likely around 30-40%. Now, we need to consider the joint probability of both events occurring. Since these events are largely independent, we can multiply their individual probabilities. Assuming a 0.5% chance of Biden's death (a rough estimate, given the lack of precise data) and a 35% chance of a female nominee (a rough estimate, given the uncertainties of the nomination process), the joint probability would be approximately 0.175% (0.005 x 0.35)."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "17003ecc-d472-4016-aa8a-c1c8a2d930a4", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden dies before Saturday (b) The 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee is a Woman?", "body": "(a) Resolves YES if there is an official announcement of Joe Biden's death before market close at the end of Friday, July 26th.

Firstly, the investigation into potential witness tampering by Donald Trump in the context of The State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump, et al, is ongoing. Given that this investigation is specifically focused on Trump's actions related to the 2020 presidential election and the subsequent attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia, there is a clear scope for charges related to witness tampering if evidence supports such claims. Secondly, the public record already contains instances where Donald Trump and his associates have been accused of attempting to influence witnesses or officials in various investigations, including those related to the January 6th insurrection and the broader attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. This pattern of behavior suggests that witness tampering charges are within the realm of possibility if similar actions were taken in the context of the Georgia case. Thirdly, the legal context in Georgia and the specific focus of the investigation there suggest that local prosecutors are taking a hard look at Trump's actions and their implications under state law. The fact that this is a state-level investigation and prosecution also somewhat insulates it from the federal political pressures that might influence the pace or outcome of such investigations. Lastly, the timeline for such charges to be brought before June 1, 2024, is relatively tight but not impossible, given the pace of legal proceedings and the fact that investigations into Trump's activities have been ongoing for some time. Considering these factors, while there is no guarantee that charges will be brought, the combination of an ongoing investigation specifically focused on Trump's actions in Georgia, the public record of similar behavior by Trump and his associates, and the legal context suggest that the possibility of witness tampering charges being brought against Donald Trump in Georgia before June 1, 2024, is plausible."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "1371b73c-f9f8-48d4-9700-c4f244a2300e", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Vivek Ramaswamy be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (b) Donald Trump be charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: \n\n1.

The indictments must occur before June 1, 2024.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-01T04:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-02-22T16:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.28, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To answer this question, let's break down the two parts and assess their probabilities separately before combining them. Part (a): Vivek Ramaswamy becomes the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. As of my last update in April 2023, Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new figure in the political landscape, known for his entrepreneurial background and more recently, his political aspirations. While he has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, the field is expected to be crowded with more established political figures such as Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, and potentially others like Ron DeSantis. Historically, candidates with higher name recognition and political experience tend to have an advantage in securing the nomination. However, the 2016 election showed that outsiders can succeed in securing the nomination, as seen with Donald Trump's successful bid. Given the current information and historical trends, while it's possible for Vivek Ramaswamy to gain traction and secure the nomination, it seems less likely compared to more established figures. Part (b): Donald Trump is charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024. This part of the question pertains to the ongoing legal issues surrounding Donald Trump, specifically regarding allegations related to the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. The investigation led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been looking into potential interference in the election, which includes allegations that could be construed as witness tampering. Given the legal complexities and the time it takes for such investigations to unfold, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether charges will be filed before a specific date. However, the investigation has been active, and there have been indications that charges could be forthcoming, although the exact timing is uncertain. Combining the Probabilities: Given the information and analysis: For part (a), Vivek Ramaswamy securing the Republican nomination seems less likely than more established candidates but is not impossible. Let's assign a rough estimate of 10% to this event, considering the crowded field and historical precedents. For part (b), the probability of Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering before June 1, 2024, is harder to estimate due to the legal complexities and timing uncertainties. However, given the active investigation, let's assign a slightly higher probability, around 20%, acknowledging the seriousness of the allegations and the ongoing nature of the investigation. To find the combined probability of either event happening, we can use the formula for the union of two events, which is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Assuming that the events are independent (the outcome of one does not affect the probability of the other), P(A and B) would be the product of the individual probabilities. Thus, P(A or B) = 0.10 + 0.20 - (0.10 * 0.20) = 0.10 + 0.20 - 0.02 = 0.28."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.023832777804333988, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.005958194451083497, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.23025593347407647, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Anthropic's Commitment to Safety: Anthropic has demonstrated a commitment to AI safety through their research focus and publications. This suggests a genuine interest in ensuring their models are safe, which could include external red-teaming as part of their safety protocols. 2. Industry Trends: The AI industry, especially sectors focused on advanced models like those developed by Anthropic, is under increasing scrutiny regarding safety and ethics. External red-teaming is recognized as a valuable tool for identifying vulnerabilities and improving model safety. Given this trend, it's plausible that Anthropic would engage in such practices to stay aligned with industry best practices. 3. Publication of Safety Reports: Companies like Anthropic often publish reports on their safety efforts to maintain transparency and demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI development. If Anthropic conducts external red-teaming, it's reasonable to expect they would publish the results, especially if the findings contribute significantly to the field or demonstrate their models' safety. 4. Timeline: The resolution date is June 30, 2024, which gives Anthropic approximately a year from the question's creation date to conduct and publish the results of an external red-teaming effort. Given the typical pace of research and publication cycles, this timeline seems feasible for organizing and executing such a project, assuming they haven't already begun the process. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Anthropic publishing a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, seems relatively high. The company's focus on safety, the industry's push towards more transparent and rigorous safety testing, and the reasonable timeline all contribute to this assessment."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "a4d88c57-e651-488b-aaf1-1dbe6bd3798e", "title": "Will both OpenAI and Anthropic publish reports with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, both OpenAI and Anthropic publish *public* reports with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of their respective AI models.

Historical Voting Patterns: Ohio's 6th congressional district has historically leaned Republican. Bill Johnson has held the seat since 2011, indicating a strong Republican presence in the district. 2. Incumbent Party Advantage: Even though Bill Johnson is not running, the incumbent party often has an advantage in elections due to name recognition, established campaign networks, and potentially more resources. However, this advantage can be less pronounced in special elections where turnout is typically lower and can be more unpredictable. 3. Democratic Challenger: The strength of the Democratic challenger plays a significant role. A strong candidate with good funding, a compelling message, and effective campaign machinery could pose a serious challenge to Republican retention of the seat. However, as of my last update, there's limited information on specific Democratic candidates and their potential impact. 4. Political Climate: The national and local political climate in 2024 could significantly influence the election. Issues such as the economy, healthcare, and any major events leading up to the election could sway voters. If there's a strong anti-Republican sentiment nationally, it could impact local races, including this one. 5. Special Election Dynamics: Special elections can have lower turnout, which might favor a party with a strong get-out-the-vote operation. Unpredictability is higher in these elections, as fewer voters participate. Given these considerations, the Republican Party has a historical advantage in the district and the benefits of being the incumbent party.

Greece has a relatively strong history in the Eurovision Song Contest, including a win in 2005 with 'My Number One' by Helena Paparizou. Since the introduction of the semi-final format in 2004, Greece has consistently qualified for the final until 2016, when it failed to qualify for the first time. After that, Greece has had mixed results, qualifying in some years and not in others. This history suggests that while Greece has the potential to produce high-quality entries, qualification is not guaranteed. Eurovision voting patterns can be influenced by various factors, including cultural and geographical alliances, the quality of the song, and the performance on the night. Greece can often rely on votes from countries with significant Greek diaspora communities or those with cultural ties, such as Cyprus. However, the voting system and the increasing emphasis on the jury vote have made the contest more unpredictable. Any changes to the voting system, the way countries are allocated to semi-finals, or the rules regarding jury and public voting could impact a country's chances of qualifying. As of my last update, there were no announced changes that would significantly alter Greece's chances. Ultimately, the quality of the song and the artist's performance play a crucial role in qualification. Without knowing the specific entry for Greece in 2024, it's challenging to assess its potential for qualification accurately. Given these considerations, we can only make a general assessment based on historical data and trends.

However, as of now, there's no clear indication that his health would prevent him from seeking re-election. 2. Political Climate: The decision to run for re-election can be heavily influenced by the current political climate, including his approval ratings, the state of the economy, and the likelihood of winning a second term. Presidents with high approval ratings and a strong economy are more likely to seek re-election. 3. Potential Democratic Challengers: The presence of strong potential challengers within the Democratic Party could influence Biden's decision. However, as of the last update, there's no clear, strong challenger within the party that has officially announced a candidacy against him. 4. Personal Desire and Previous Statements: Biden has previously indicated a desire to run for a second term, contingent on his health. This suggests a predisposition towards seeking re-election unless significant factors deter him. 5. Timing of the Announcement: The question specifies an announcement before July 15, 2024. Typically, incumbent presidents announce their re-election bids after the midterm elections but well before the summer of the election year. An announcement that he will not run would likely come earlier rather than later to allow the party time to select and rally behind another candidate. Considering these factors, there's no strong indication as of now that Biden plans to step down or not accept the nomination. His inclination seems to be towards running for a second term if his health allows.

Popularity of Trump among Republicans: As of my last update, Donald Trump remains a highly influential figure within the Republican Party. His popularity among Republican voters is significant, and he has maintained a strong base of support since leaving office. This suggests that if he were to run, he would be a formidable candidate for the nomination. 2. Potential Challengers: The field of potential Republican candidates for 2024 is wide, including figures like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence, among others. The strength of these challengers and their ability to gain traction among Republican voters could impact Trump's chances. However, as of now, none have demonstrated the same level of support or recognition as Trump within the party. 3. Trump's Intentions: While Donald Trump has not officially announced his candidacy for the 2024 election, he has hinted at the possibility multiple times. His intentions and decision on whether to run will significantly influence the probability of a Trump family member securing the nomination. 4. Other Trump Family Members: While other members of the Trump family, such as Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, have been involved in politics to various degrees, none have indicated a serious intention to run for president in 2024. Their potential candidacies seem less likely and would likely face more significant challenges in gaining widespread support within the party. 5. Legal and Health Factors: Trump's legal issues and health status could also impact his decision and ability to run. However, as of now, these factors do not seem to deter his potential candidacy significantly. Considering these factors, the most likely scenario for a Trump family member to be the Republican nominee is if Donald Trump decides to run.

Current Political Context: As of my last update, Joe Biden is the President of the United States, and Kamala Harris is the Vice President. The Biden administration's stability and the general health of the president are crucial factors. Unless there's a significant change in President Biden's health or political status, the likelihood of Vice President Harris assuming the presidency might be relatively low. 2. Health of President Biden: President Biden's health is a critical factor. If he were to become incapacitated or pass away, Vice President Harris would be next in line for the presidency. However, without specific information suggesting a decline in President Biden's health, we can only speculate based on his age and the natural risks associated with it. 3. Resignation or Removal of President Biden: Another scenario in which Vice President Harris could become president is if President Biden were to resign or be removed from office. These are extraordinary events that, based on historical precedent, are rare and usually require significant political upheaval or scandal. 4. Time Frame: The specified time frame ends on July 26, 2024. This is before the 2024 presidential election, which means our focus is on events that could lead to a transition within the current administration rather than through an electoral process. Given these considerations, without specific evidence of President Biden's declining health or an imminent political crisis that would lead to his resignation or removal, the likelihood of Vice President Harris becoming President or Acting President before the specified date appears low.

His popularity among certain segments of the Republican base is high, and he has expressed interest in running for the presidency again. Given his previous success in securing the nomination and his continued influence within the party, he is a strong contender. 2. **Donald Trump Jr.**: While Donald Trump Jr. has been involved in politics and has a following, his likelihood of securing the Republican nomination is lower compared to his father. He lacks the same level of political experience and broad recognition. 3. **Eric Trump**: Similar to Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump's involvement in politics is mostly through his family connections. He is less likely to secure the nomination due to his limited political experience and lower public profile. 4. **Ivanka Trump**: Ivanka Trump has had more formal involvement in politics, serving as an advisor to her father during his presidency. However, her appeal to the broader Republican base is uncertain, and her lack of elected office experience makes her a less likely candidate for the nomination. 5. **Tiffany Trump, Melania Trump, and Barron Trump**: These family members have less direct involvement in politics and are unlikely to be considered seriously for the Republican nomination. Considering these factors, the most likely scenario for a Trump family member to become the Republican nominee is through Donald Trump himself. The Republican Party's dynamics and the loyalty of a significant portion of its base to Trump make him a strong candidate for the nomination. However, the political landscape can change rapidly, and other potential candidates could emerge, challenging Trump's dominance within the party.

For event (a), we need to consider the probability that Joe Biden will have a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Donald Trump according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for July 19, 2024. Since we don't have real-time access to the forecast data, we'll rely on general knowledge about the election and the candidates. As of the market's creation date (July 16, 2024), the election is still several months away, and various factors can influence the forecast, such as campaign events, debates, and external factors like economic conditions. However, considering Biden's incumbent status and general polling trends, it's reasonable to assume he might have a slight advantage in the forecast. Let's assign a probability of 0.6 to this event. For event (b), we need to consider the probability that Kamala Harris will choose either Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro as her running mate. The market description mentions that these two individuals are currently the favorites, but it's essential to note that running mate choices can be unpredictable and influenced by various factors, including party dynamics, geographic considerations, and personal relationships. While Kelly and Shapiro might be strong contenders, it's difficult to assign a high probability to this event without more information about Harris's decision-making process. Let's assign a probability of 0.4 to this event. Since both events need to occur for the market to resolve to 'YES,' we need to multiply the probabilities of the individual events. Therefore, the probability of both events occurring is: 0.6 (event a) \u00d7 0.4 (event b) = 0.24.

Historical Progression: The Olympic record in the men's 100m dash has progressively improved over the years, but at a slowing rate. The current record of 9.63s, set by Usain Bolt in 2012, has stood for over a decade, indicating a high benchmark. 2. Current Athlete Performance: As of the last available data before the creation of this question, several athletes have been performing close to the record, with some achieving sub-9.90s times. However, consistently breaking the 9.63s barrier is an exceptional feat that requires not just speed but also perfect race execution and conditions. 3. Advancements in Training and Technology: Improvements in training methods, sports science, and equipment technology can contribute to faster times. However, the men's 100m dash is a relatively simple event in terms of required equipment (primarily shoes and track surface), and while advancements can help, they might not be enough to significantly shave off times without a generational talent. 4. Competitive Environment: The Olympics provide the highest level of competition, where athletes often push themselves to new limits. The atmosphere and stakes can drive athletes to achieve record-breaking performances. Considering these factors, breaking the Olympic record requires a combination of exceptional talent, peak condition, optimal race execution, and perhaps a bit of luck with weather conditions. Given the long-standing nature of the current record and the rarity of athletes capable of challenging it, the likelihood of the record being broken seems relatively low but not impossible, especially considering the high level of competition expected at the Olympics."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "429b9966-b192-4461-a0c2-138db110feb8", "title": "Will Individual Neutral Athletes Win \u226515 Gold Medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Individual Neutral Athletes collectively win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

First, let's consider the men's 100m dash. The current Olympic record is 9.63 seconds, set by Usain Bolt in 2012. To break this record, an athlete would need to run the 100m dash in less than 9.63 seconds. Given the current state of athletics and the continuous improvement in performance, it's possible that an athlete could break this record. However, it's also a challenging feat that requires a combination of exceptional talent, training, and conditions. Now, let's consider the second component: Individual Neutral Athletes winning \u226515 gold medals. The term 'Individual Neutral Athletes' refers to athletes who compete under the Olympic flag rather than representing a specific country. These athletes often come from countries that are under sanctions or have been banned from competing under their national flag. Given the current geopolitical landscape and the fact that Russia, for example, has been competing under the Olympic flag in some sports due to doping sanctions, it's possible that Individual Neutral Athletes could win a significant number of gold medals. However, winning \u226515 gold medals would require a strong performance across multiple sports and events. To estimate the probability of either event occurring, we need to consider the likelihood of each event separately and then combine them. For the men's 100m dash, I would estimate the probability of an athlete breaking the Olympic record as follows: Probability of an athlete running the 100m dash in less than 9.63 seconds: 0.2 (or 20%). This is a subjective estimate based on the current state of athletics and the fact that records are meant to be broken. However, it's also a challenging feat that requires exceptional performance. For Individual Neutral Athletes winning \u226515 gold medals, I would estimate the probability as follows: Probability of Individual Neutral Athletes winning \u226515 gold medals: 0.1 (or 10%). This is also a subjective estimate based on the current geopolitical landscape and the fact that Individual Neutral Athletes have competed under the Olympic flag in the past. However, winning \u226515 gold medals would require a strong performance across multiple sports and events. To combine these probabilities, we can use the formula for the probability of either event occurring: P(Either event) = P(Event 1) + P(Event 2) - P(Both events). Since the events are independent, we can assume that P(Both events) is negligible. Therefore: P(Either event) = P(Event 1) + P(Event 2) = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3. Based on the analysis above, I estimate that the probability of either the men's 100m dash winning time breaking the Olympic record or Individual Neutral Athletes winning \u226515 gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics is 0.3."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0029388433370520495, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0007347108342630124, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07986523020975035, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, we need to understand the qualification process for the Eurovision Grand Final. In Eurovision, countries that are not part of the 'Big Five' (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) must participate in one of two semi-finals. From each semi-final, the top 10 countries, as determined by a combination of jury and public voting, qualify for the Grand Final. Latvia and Australia are not part of the 'Big Five,' so they will have to compete in the semi-finals to qualify for the Grand Final. Next, let's consider the historical performance of Latvia and Australia in Eurovision: Latvia has participated in Eurovision 22 times and has qualified for the Grand Final 10 times since the introduction of the semi-final format in 2004, giving them a qualification rate of about 45.5%. Australia has participated 7 times and has qualified for the Grand Final every time since its debut in 2015, although it was granted a direct spot in the Grand Final for its first appearance. If we exclude the direct qualification in 2015, Australia's qualification rate is 100% for the years it competed through the semi-finals. Given these statistics, Australia has a strong track record of qualifying for the Grand Final, while Latvia's performance is more variable. However, predicting Eurovision outcomes is inherently uncertain due to the subjective nature of the contest, which is influenced by various factors such as song quality, performance, staging, and voting patterns that can change from year to year. Considering the past performance and the inherent unpredictability of Eurovision, we can make an educated guess about the likelihood of either Latvia or Australia qualifying for the Grand Final. Given Australia's consistent qualification record and assuming that they will continue to send competitive entries, it's reasonable to believe that Australia has a high chance of qualifying again. Latvia's chances are harder to predict due to their more variable past performance, but there's always a possibility they could qualify with a strong entry. Therefore, taking into account the historical data and the subjective nature of the contest, the probability that either Latvia or Australia will qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024 is relatively high, especially considering Australia's consistent track record."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.013700452500578553, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.003425113125144638, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.16839058026988785, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current Position and Profile: As of my last update, Kamala Harris holds the position of Vice President under the Biden administration. She was chosen as Joe Biden's running mate in the 2020 presidential election, marking a significant milestone as the first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American to hold the office. 2. Biden's Reelection Bid: President Joe Biden has announced his intention to run for reelection in the 2024 presidential election. This is crucial because if Biden secures the Democratic nomination, it is highly likely that he would choose to keep Harris as his running mate for consistency and to leverage the experience and public profile she has built up during their first term together. 3. Harris's Performance and Public Perception: The perception of Harris's performance as VP and her approval ratings among the public and within the Democratic Party could influence Biden's decision. While opinions may vary, her historical significance and her efforts on various policy fronts, such as immigration and women's rights, could positively impact her standing. 4. Potential Alternatives: The decision to replace Harris would require a compelling reason, given her historic role and the potential backlash from her supporters within the party. Any alternative candidate would need to bring significant advantages to the ticket, such as broad appeal to swing voters, the ability to secure a key state, or a strong resume that complements Biden's. 5. Party Unity and Election Strategy: The Democratic Party's strategy for the 2024 election, including appealing to a broad coalition of voters and maintaining party unity, would also play a role. Harris's presence on the ticket could be seen as a unifying factor, given her appeal to various demographics. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Kamala Harris being the Democratic VP nominee again is high, primarily due to her current role, Biden's reelection bid, and the strategic advantages of maintaining consistency in the ticket."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "91d7d49e-b5a5-4dad-af04-1b10b7b9f542", "title": "Will Larry Elder be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Historical Performance of Swimmers: Historically, swimmers have been among the top medal winners at the Olympics. This is partly due to the large number of events in swimming and the possibility of individual athletes competing in multiple events. Notable examples include Michael Phelps, who holds the record for the most gold medals won by an individual in Olympic history, and Katie Ledecky, who has dominated women's distance swimming events. 2. Number of Swimming Events: Swimming has a large number of events, with competitions in various strokes and distances for both men and women. This provides swimmers with more opportunities to win medals compared to sports with fewer events. 3. Competition from Other Sports: While swimmers have historically performed well, athletes from other sports, such as gymnastics, track and field, and cycling, also have the potential to win multiple gold medals. The distribution of talent and the competitive landscape across different sports can vary from one Olympics to another. 4. Current Talent Pool in Swimming: As of the last available information, there are several talented swimmers who could potentially win multiple gold medals. However, the performance of athletes can fluctuate, and new stars may emerge in the lead-up to the Olympics. 5.

(a) A swimmer winning the most gold medals: Historically, swimmers have had a strong showing in the Olympics, often winning multiple gold medals. This is due in part to the nature of swimming competitions, where athletes can compete in multiple events without the same level of physical strain seen in some other sports. The likes of Michael Phelps, Katie Ledecky, and Mark Spitz have all won numerous gold medals in swimming in past Olympics. However, with the ever-increasing competitiveness in the Olympics and the emergence of talented athletes across various disciplines, it's not a certainty that a swimmer will win the most gold medals. (b) The same nation winning more than one women's team sport: Women's team sports in the Olympics include association football, 3\u00d73 basketball, 5\u00d75 basketball, field hockey, handball, rugby sevens, volleyball, and water polo. Historically, certain nations have shown dominance in multiple team sports, such as the United States in basketball and volleyball, or the Netherlands in field hockey and water polo. The probability of the same nation winning more than one of these sports is influenced by the competitive landscape. While it's common for nations to excel in specific sports, the diversity of talent globally means that no single nation is likely to dominate across multiple sports without strong competition. Considering both components: The likelihood of both events occurring is less than the likelihood of either event occurring on its own, as both conditions must be met.

A swimmer winning the most gold medals at the 2024 Olympics. 2. The same nation winning more than one women's team sport. Component 1: A Swimmer Winning the Most Gold Medals. Historically, swimmers have been among the top medal winners at the Olympics, with icons like Michael Phelps holding the record for the most gold medals won by an individual. Swimming events offer multiple opportunities for athletes to win medals, given the variety of strokes and distances. However, the landscape of Olympic sports is constantly evolving, with new sports and disciplines being added, which could potentially dilute the dominance of swimmers in the overall medal count. Component 2: The Same Nation Winning More Than One Women's Team Sport. This component hinges on the performance of national teams in women's team sports. Given the diversity of sports included (association football, 3\u00d73 basketball, 5\u00d75 basketball, field hockey, handball, rugby sevens, volleyball, and water polo), it's plausible that a strong sporting nation could excel in more than one of these areas. The United States, for example, has traditionally been strong in basketball and could potentially perform well in other team sports. However, the increasing competitiveness of women's sports globally means that upsets and surprises are more common than ever. Reasoning for Probability Estimate: Given the historical dominance of swimmers in the Olympic medal count and the potential for strong sporting nations to excel in multiple women's team sports, there's a reasonable chance that either of these scenarios could occur. However, the outcome is far from certain due to the unpredictable nature of sports competitions and the evolving landscape of Olympic sports. Probability Estimate: Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of either a swimmer winning the most gold medals or the same nation winning more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics as follows: Probability: 0.65. This estimate reflects a moderate level of confidence in the combined likelihood of these two scenarios occurring, while also acknowledging the inherent uncertainties and unpredictabilities of sports competitions."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.02095910707540599, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.005239776768851498, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.20727892860286068, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The President of the United States, Joe Biden, has been in office since January 2021, and there has been no official indication of an early departure or incapacitation that would trigger a transfer of power. 2. Health and Incapacity: The health and well-being of President Biden are crucial. However, without recent or credible information suggesting a severe health crisis or incapacitation that would necessitate a transfer of power, this factor remains speculative. 3. Legal or Political Processes: Any legal or political processes that could lead to the removal or incapacitation of President Biden (such as impeachment and conviction, or invocation of the 25th Amendment) are complex, require significant time, and are highly partisan. Given the current political landscape, such scenarios are unlikely to unfold rapidly. 4. Unexpected Events: The nature of politics is inherently unpredictable. Events can unfold rapidly due to unforeseen circumstances. However, basing a probability estimate on unforeseen events without concrete evidence or historical precedent would be speculative.

Historically, candidates rarely drop out this late in the race without a major scandal or health issue. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, the absence of any widely known, significant issues at this point makes it less likely for Biden to drop out. Moreover, the decision to drop out of a presidential race is monumental and typically follows severe public pressure, significant loss of party support, or personal reasons of extreme nature. Given the late stage and the fact that no such indicators are widely reported as of the market's creation, it seems improbable that such a scenario would unfold in the given timeframe.

However, the field of potential candidates for such positions is often wide, and favorites can change over time due to various factors including political dynamics, public opinion, and strategic considerations. The fact that Kamala Harris is expected to make her choice before August 7th indicates a specific timeframe, but without further information about her preferences, the party's strategic direction, or unexpected events that could influence the decision, we have to rely on the information that Kelly and Shapiro are favorites. Being favorites suggests they have a higher probability than others, but not necessarily that they are the only contenders or that their selection is certain. Given that there are two favorites mentioned and the outcome is binary (either one of them or neither of them), and considering the nature of political predictions where favorites can change and other candidates can emerge, it seems reasonable to assign a higher probability to the scenario that one of them would be chosen, considering their status as favorites at the time of the prediction.

Understanding the Polls: There are two polls in question, both hosted on Manifold. One poll pits Donald Trump against Joe Biden, and the other pits Trump against a generic Democrat. The outcome we're interested in is whether Trump gains at least 3% more votes when facing a generic Democrat compared to facing Joe Biden specifically. 2. Public Opinion Trends: It's mentioned that public opinion polls show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, but other Democrats either lead Trump or are within the margin of error in hypothetical matchups. This suggests a specific vulnerability or lack of enthusiasm for Biden that doesn't necessarily apply to other Democrats. 3. Representativeness of Manifold Respondents: The question of whether Manifold respondents are representative of the general public is crucial. If they are, we might expect their voting patterns to mirror those seen in broader public opinion polls. However, if they have a unique demographic or ideological skew, their responses might diverge from general trends. 4. Calculating Trump's Vote Share: The formula provided calculates Trump's vote share as a proportion of total votes cast for Trump, the Democrat (either Biden or generic), and 'Someone else.' The resolution criterion is whether Trump's share in the poll against a generic Democrat is at least 3% higher than his share in the poll against Biden. Given these considerations: - If Manifold respondents reflect broader public opinion trends, and those trends show Biden underperforming a generic Democrat against Trump, it's plausible that Trump could gain more votes against a generic Democrat. - However, the specific 3% threshold introduces some uncertainty. Polling margins can be tight, and a 3% difference is not trivial. It requires a clear and significant preference for Trump when facing a generic Democrat over Biden. Considering these factors, and acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in polling and respondent representativeness, my reasoning suggests a cautious optimism towards the resolution criterion being met, but with a significant degree of uncertainty."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "77a3335c-866e-41a4-8b3d-91e4b1878a8b", "title": "Will USD be worth >= 145 JPY (yen) at close on August 9th, 2024?", "body": "[image]\n\nMarket resolves according to USD/JPY close listed for August 9th, 2024 on Yahoo!

Historical Performance: Ireland has a rich history in Eurovision, having won the contest a record seven times. However, their performance has been less consistent in recent years. Since the introduction of the semi-final format in 2004, Ireland has qualified for the final roughly half the time. This suggests that while they have the potential to do well, qualification is far from guaranteed. 2. Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the performing artist can significantly impact a country's chances. Without knowing who will represent Ireland in 2024 and what their song will be, it's challenging to assess this factor accurately. However, Ireland has shown the ability to select competitive entries in the past. 3. Competition and Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be highly unpredictable and is influenced by a mix of song quality, performance, and geopolitical factors. Some countries tend to vote more consistently for others, but these patterns can change. The competition in the semi-finals, where countries are randomly allocated to perform, also plays a significant role. A strong performance can boost a country's chances, but the competition's quality can significantly impact qualification chances. 4. Recent Trends: In recent years, there has been a trend towards more contemporary and innovative entries doing well. If Ireland can select an entry that resonates with both the public and juries, their chances of qualification will increase. Given these factors, and without specific information about Ireland's entry for 2024, it's reasonable to approach this question with a cautious optimism based on Ireland's historical success but also acknowledging the unpredictability and competitive nature of Eurovision."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a5a30c39-d4c9-4547-b81c-818773873ad5", "title": "Will Cyprus qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Cyprus participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Line of Succession: As Vice President, Kamala Harris is next in line for the presidency after President Joe Biden. This means that if anything were to happen to President Biden, such as resignation, incapacitation, or death, Vice President Harris would be next in line to assume the role of President or Acting President. 2. Health and Stability of President Biden: As of my last update, President Biden has shown no public indication of intending to resign and appears to be in relatively good health for his age. However, his age does increase the risk of health-related issues. 3. Impeachment or Removal: Another pathway for Vice President Harris to assume the presidency would be through the impeachment and removal of President Biden. This is a highly unlikely scenario given the current political makeup of Congress and the lack of any known grounds for such action. 4. Temporary Transfer of Power: In cases where the President is temporarily unable to discharge the duties of the office (such as during a medical procedure requiring anesthesia), the Vice President can take over as Acting President. However, these instances are typically planned and brief. Considering these factors, the most likely scenarios for Vice President Harris to become President or Acting President before July 26, 2024, involve unforeseen events related to President Biden's health or an unexpected political development leading to his resignation or removal.

For event (a), another Democratic party presidential debate happening, we should consider the following: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) typically organizes several debates during the primary season to allow candidates to present their policies and visions to the public. The number and timing of debates can vary based on the number of candidates, the primary schedule, and other factors. Given the significance of the 2024 presidential election and the potential for a contested primary, it's plausible that the DNC would organize multiple debates to ensure thorough discussion and evaluation of the candidates. For event (b), if Joe Biden drops out and a reliable media outlet covering the story at least 6 hours in advance, we should consider the following: Major news outlets like the Associated Press, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Reuters, and Washington Post have extensive networks of journalists and sources within the political sphere. These outlets often break significant political news stories, including announcements about candidates' decisions to drop out of a race. Given the significance of a sitting President potentially dropping out of a re-election bid, it's likely that rumors or unofficial confirmations would circulate within the media and be reported before an official announcement. However, the requirement for a 6-hour advance notice is quite specific and depends on the timing of Biden's decision (if he were to drop out) and how it is communicated or leaked to the press. Considering these factors: Event (a) seems likely given the usual practice of the DNC and the importance of debates in the primary process. Event (b) is more contingent on specific circumstances but seems plausible given the capabilities and practices of major news outlets. However, the specificity of the 6-hour window introduces some uncertainty. Given these considerations, the probability that both events occur seems reasonably high, especially considering the usual practices in political reporting and the primary process.

Media Landscape and Competition: Major media outlets like Associated Press News, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Reuters, and Washington Post have extensive networks of journalists and sources. Given the significance of such a story, there is a high level of competition among these outlets to be the first to break major news. This competition often leads to stories being leaked and reported quickly. 2. Source Secrecy and Leaks: In high-stakes political environments, secrets are difficult to keep. If there is any discussion or decision made about Joe Biden dropping out, it's likely that rumors or confirmations could leak to the press through various channels, including disgruntled staff members, political adversaries, or even allies trying to manage the narrative. 3. Journalistic Practices: Reliable media outlets have standards for verifying information before publication. However, the importance of such a story would likely prompt these outlets to expedite their verification processes. Given the outlets listed, at least one is likely to have a source close enough to the situation to get unofficial confirmation that meets their reporting standards. 4. The Nature of Political Campaigns: Political campaigns are fluid, and decisions can be made rapidly. However, a decision as significant as a presidential candidate dropping out would likely involve some preparatory work (like notifying key supporters, preparing a statement) that increases the chances of the story leaking. 5. Conditionality on Joe Biden Dropping Out: The question is predicated on Joe Biden actually dropping out, which is a significant condition. As of the last information available, there's no clear indication he plans to do so. However, if he were to drop out, it would be a monumental political event, increasing the likelihood that media outlets would be vigilant and quick to report any hints of such a decision. Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that if Joe Biden were to drop out, the likelihood of a reliable media outlet getting wind of this and reporting it at least 6 hours in advance is quite high. The competitive nature of news reporting, the difficulty in keeping political secrets, and the significance of the event all contribute to this assessment."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "4d37f61d-e5d1-4790-91da-7d2b58771d48", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Israel carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, and (b) if Joe Biden drops out, a reliable media outlet cover the story at least 6 hours in advance?", "body": "(a) This question resolves **Yes** if, following the date of this question's publication and before May 1, 2024, credible reports indicate that an attack attributed to Israel and occurring within Iran's borders has led to the death of at least five individuals.\n\n(b) Question resolves YES if a big and reliable media outlet like Associated Press News, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Reuters, or Washington Post covers the dropout with an unofficial confirmation at least 6 hours before President Joe Biden officially announces his dropout via letter, speech, etc.\n\nLocal news, conspiracy websites, or comments by individual users on Manifold will not be sufficient.\n\nThis market will be resolved as N/A if President Joe Biden does not drop out before the end of the National Democratic Convention.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-22T21:10:22Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-13T22:04:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.16, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "The probability of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, is relatively low, given the potential risks and diplomatic fallout.

Historical Performance: Both Czechia and Georgia have had mixed results in Eurovision. Czechia has qualified for the Grand Final a few times, with their best result being 6th place in 2018. Georgia has also had some successful years, but their performance has been inconsistent. Understanding their historical performance can give us a baseline for their potential, but it's essential to consider more recent trends and specific factors for Eurovision 2024. 2. Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the artist's performance are crucial factors in Eurovision success. As of my last update, I don't have information on the specific entries for Czechia and Georgia for Eurovision 2024. The reception of their songs, both by the public and the juries, will significantly influence their chances of qualifying. 3. Competition: The level of competition in the semi-finals is another critical factor. The number of participating countries and the quality of their entries can affect the chances of any single country qualifying. A particularly strong lineup in a semi-final could make it harder for Czechia or Georgia to stand out. 4. Voting Patterns: Voting patterns, including both jury and public votes, can be somewhat predictable, with countries often supporting their neighbors or countries with similar cultural backgrounds. However, these patterns can change, and it's challenging to predict how they will affect Czechia and Georgia without knowing the specifics of their entries and performances. 5. Recent Trends: Recent years have seen a mix of traditional Eurovision countries and newcomers achieving success. This unpredictability makes it harder to forecast based solely on past performance. Given these factors, without specific information on the entries for Czechia and Georgia, or the overall lineup for Eurovision 2024, it's challenging to provide a precise probability estimate. However, considering the historical performance and the general unpredictability of Eurovision, a reasonable approach is to consider a moderate probability for either country qualifying, acknowledging that there's always a chance for any country to have a standout performance or song that resonates with voters."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0033149250337863867, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0008287312584465967, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08141255010133057, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Past Performance: Historically, the Netherlands has had a stronger track record in qualifying for the Grand Final compared to Croatia. The Netherlands has qualified several times since the introduction of the semi-finals in 2004, including a win in 2019. Croatia, on the other hand, has had less consistent success, with fewer qualifications and no wins since its independence. 2. Current Trends: Eurovision voting trends can be unpredictable, but certain patterns emerge, such as the influence of diaspora voting, regional alliances, and the impact of the jury vote. Both countries can potentially benefit from these factors, but the Netherlands might have a slight edge due to its more consistent performance and appeal to a broader audience. 3. Changes to Contest Format: Any changes to the voting system, the composition of the semi-finals, or the rules governing song submissions could affect the qualification chances. However, without specific details on changes for Eurovision 2024, it's challenging to assess their impact. 4. Song and Artist Quality: Ultimately, the quality and appeal of the song and artist chosen by each country play a significant role in qualification. This factor is highly variable and can significantly influence voting outcomes. Considering these factors, the Netherlands appears to have a stronger foundation for qualifying for the Grand Final based on past performance and broader appeal. However, Eurovision is inherently unpredictable, and the quality of the entry, performance on the night, and other intangible factors can significantly influence the outcome. Therefore, while it's reasonable to believe that at least one of the two might qualify, especially given the Netherlands' recent success, it's also possible that neither could qualify if their entries fail to resonate with voters."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.049107470202635894, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.012276867550658974, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3151789148156501, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current Political Context: As of my last update, the political situation in France has been characterized by a diversity of parties and coalitions. The New Popular Front (Nouvelle Union Populaire \u00c9cologiste et Sociale, NUPES) and Together (Ensemble) are two significant coalitions that have been prominent in recent elections. However, the political landscape in France is known for its fluidity, with shifts in public opinion and party alliances not uncommon. 2. Election Cycles and Government Formation: The question pertains to the Prime Minister's party affiliation on July 30, 2024. This date suggests a focus on the outcome of legislative elections or potential government reshuffles that could occur prior to this date. In France, the Prime Minister is appointed by the President but must be supported by a majority in the National Assembly. This means that the composition of the National Assembly following legislative elections directly influences the appointment of the Prime Minister. 3. Potential for Shifts in Party Alliances: French politics has seen unexpected alliances and shifts in party loyalties. The period between now and July 30, 2024, allows for significant political maneuvering, including the possibility of new alliances forming outside of the New Popular Front and Together coalitions. 4. Public Opinion and Election Outcomes: Public opinion and election outcomes are inherently unpredictable. Factors such as economic conditions, social issues, and international events can significantly influence voter preferences and, consequently, the composition of the government.

If health issues become more pronounced or if he feels that his age significantly impacts his ability to serve effectively, he might consider not running. 2. Approval Ratings and Public Support: The president's approval ratings and public support are crucial indicators of his potential success in an election. If Biden's ratings are low and public support wanes, especially among key Democratic constituencies, he might decide against seeking another term. 3. Economic and Political Landscape: The state of the economy, ongoing political trends, and significant events (domestic or international) could influence Biden's decision. A strong economy and favorable political landscape might encourage him to run, while a recession or significant political challenges might deter him. 4. Democratic Party Dynamics: The dynamics within the Democratic Party, including the emergence of potential challengers or shifts in party priorities, could also play a role. If the party seems to be moving in a direction that significantly differs from Biden's vision or if strong challengers emerge, he might choose not to run. 5. Personal Decision: Ultimately, the decision might come down to Biden's personal desire to serve another term. Factors such as his energy levels, his family's support, and his own sense of purpose and legacy could all influence this decision. Given these considerations, and without current data on Biden's health, approval ratings, or the political and economic landscape as of early 2024, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that the market needs 78 more traders to reach the target. Assuming that the market has been growing steadily since its creation on July 4, we can estimate the average daily growth rate. Let's assume that the market had 0 traders on July 4 and has been growing linearly since then. To reach 299 traders (377 - 78) in 11 days (July 4 to July 15), the market would need to grow at an average rate of approximately 27 traders per day. To reach the target of 377 traders, the market would need to maintain this growth rate for the remaining 11 days. However, it's likely that the growth rate will slow down as the market approaches its target. Additionally, there may be external factors that affect the growth rate, such as changes in market conditions or the popularity of the market. Given these uncertainties, it's difficult to estimate the probability with high confidence.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update, Chris Christie, the former Governor of New Jersey, has been a significant figure in the Republican Party. However, his popularity and influence within the party have waxed and waned, particularly following his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal and his subsequent criticisms of Donald Trump. 2. Previous Presidential Runs: Christie has previously run for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election but dropped out early in the race. This history might suggest a challenge in gaining widespread support within the party for another run. 3. Competition: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates potentially running, including Donald Trump, who has a significant base within the party. Other potential candidates might include Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley, among others. The competition for the nomination will be fierce, making it challenging for Christie to stand out and secure the nomination. 4. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party's dynamics have shifted significantly since Christie's last run, with a greater emphasis on loyalty to Trump and his policies among a large segment of the party base. Christie's criticisms of Trump could make it difficult for him to win over Trump loyalists. 5. Fundraising and Support: Securing the nomination requires significant fundraising capabilities and support from major donors and party leaders. Christie's ability to attract these resources compared to other candidates is uncertain. Given these considerations, while Chris Christie has a certain level of recognition and experience, the challenges he faces in securing the Republican nomination for the 2024 US Presidential Election are substantial. The crowded field, the dynamics within the party, and his past performance in presidential politics suggest that his chances are relatively low compared to other potential candidates."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "200d3bf1-74b5-4bbd-a353-869e65c10ff5", "title": "Will Biden drop out before 7/13?", "body": "If Biden drops out or is otherwise unable to continue his run as president before midnight July 13 Central Time, this market will resolve to yes.

Facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, will Trump gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents? Analysis: Public opinion polls have shown that Joe Biden tends to perform worse against Donald Trump compared to a generic Democrat. This suggests a specific disadvantage for Biden in head-to-head matchups against Trump, which could be attributed to various factors including personal approval ratings, policy preferences, or simply the known quantity that is Joe Biden versus the hypothetical nature of a 'generic Democrat.' However, the question specifically asks about Manifold respondents, a group that might not perfectly mirror the broader public due to self-selection biases, political engagement, or other factors unique to the Manifold platform. Probability Assessment: Given the general trend in public opinion polls, it seems plausible that Trump could gain at least 3% more against Biden compared to a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. However, the representativeness of Manifold respondents compared to the general public is a critical unknown. Assuming Manifold respondents do reflect broader public opinion trends to some extent, I would cautiously estimate the probability of this event as somewhat likely, but with a significant margin for error due to the specificity of the platform and the respondents. 2. Will Donald Trump testify at the hush money trial? Analysis: This part of the question involves considerable uncertainty, as it pertains to legal proceedings and the strategic decisions of Donald Trump and his legal team. Trump testifying would be highly unusual given the conventional legal strategy of not having defendants testify in their own defense, especially in high-profile cases. However, Trump has historically defied conventions in many aspects of his public life. Probability Assessment: Given the unpredictability of Trump's actions and the rarity of defendants testifying in their own trials, this event seems less likely than the first. However, never ruling out Trump's inclination to defy norms, it's not an impossibility. I would estimate this probability as lower than the first event. Combined Probability Assessment: To find the combined probability of both independent events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event. However, since I've provided qualitative assessments rather than specific probabilities up to this point, let's translate those into rough numerical estimates for the purpose of calculation: 1. Trump gaining at least 3% against Biden compared to a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents might be around 60% likely, reflecting a cautious optimism that Manifold respondents will mirror broader public opinion trends but with significant uncertainty. 2. Trump testifying at the hush money trial could be estimated as around 20% likely, reflecting the unpredictability of Trump's actions but also the conventional wisdom against defendants testifying in their own defense. Combined Probability Calculation: 0.60 (first event) * 0.20 (second event) = 0.12. Reasoning and Probability Summary: Given the analysis of both components of the question, the probability that both events occur\u2014Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, and Donald Trump testifies at the hush money trial\u2014is estimated to be on the lower side due to the significant uncertainty and the generally unlikely nature of the second event."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "682c1618-37ad-4de9-a871-5d94683e7ccf", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat (b) Trump testifies at the hush money trial?", "body": "(a) There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6.

Historical Performance: Ireland has a rich history in Eurovision, with seven wins, the most recent being in 1996. However, their performance has varied significantly over the years, especially in the semi-finals era. Since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, Ireland has had mixed success, qualifying for the final roughly half the time. 2. Recent Trends: In recent years, Ireland has shown a slight improvement in qualifying for the final. For instance, in the 2020s, they have qualified more consistently than in the 2010s, suggesting a possible upward trend in their performance or selection process. 3. Song and Artist Selection Process: The method by which Ireland selects its entry can impact its chances. Some years, Ireland uses a national final, while other years the entry is internally selected. The success of either method can vary, but a well-chosen entry, regardless of the selection method, significantly boosts qualification chances. 4. Competition and Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be unpredictable and is influenced by many factors, including song quality, performance, and geopolitical considerations. Ireland, being a Western European country, might face challenges in garnering votes from Eastern European countries, which often vote for their regional neighbors. However, Ireland can rely on some consistent voting support from the UK and, to a lesser extent, other Western countries. 5. 2024 Entry Specifics: Without knowing the specifics of Ireland's entry for 2024 (song, artist, selection method), it's challenging to assess its potential for qualification accurately. A strong, catchy song with a memorable performance can significantly increase Ireland's chances of qualifying. Considering these factors, the probability of Ireland qualifying for the Grand Final is somewhat above a simple coin toss due to their historical success and recent trends of slight improvement.

Predicting stock market movements with precision is notoriously challenging due to the vast array of factors that can influence market behavior, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. However, we can consider historical trends and volatility to make an educated guess. The BSE SENSEX has shown a general upward trend over the years, but it also experiences fluctuations. The range specified (75,000 to 76,000) represents a relatively narrow band, making it a somewhat specific and challenging target to hit exactly by the end of the specified date. (b) The second part of the question involves predicting whether a linked market will attract at least 377 traders by the end of July 15.

Given the specificity of both predictions and the inherent uncertainties involved in market predictions and user engagement, the likelihood of both events occurring exactly as described seems low.

This is attributed to a combination of genetic factors, high-altitude training, and cultural influences that encourage running from a young age. 2. Current Talent Pool: As of the last available data, the world's top marathon runners include a significant number of athletes of Kalenjin descent. This suggests a strong talent pool that could potentially compete at the highest level in the 2024 Olympics. 3. Competition from Other Regions: Despite the historical dominance of Kalenjin athletes, marathon running has become increasingly competitive, with top-tier athletes emerging from various parts of the world, including Ethiopia, Uganda, and even Western countries. This diversification of talent could potentially challenge Kalenjin dominance. 4. Event-Specific Factors: The marathon is particularly susceptible to variables such as weather conditions, course layout, and race strategy. These factors can sometimes favor athletes who might not be the favorites based on personal best times or recent performances. 5. Injury and Form: The likelihood of both men's and women's favorites being in peak form and injury-free at the time of the Olympics is a critical factor. The high mileage required for marathon training increases the risk of injury, which can affect even the best athletes. Considering these factors, while Kalenjin athletes have a strong historical advantage and a deep talent pool, the nature of the marathon and the increasing global competition make it challenging to predict a sweep with absolute certainty.

Second, historically, swimmers have often been among the top medal winners at the Olympics. Athletes like Michael Phelps, who holds the record for the most gold medals won by an individual in Olympic history, demonstrate the potential for swimmers to accumulate a large number of gold medals. Third, the competition in swimming is fierce, but top swimmers often specialize in multiple events, increasing their chances of winning more medals.

Media's Ability to Break News Early: Major news outlets like the Associated Press News, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Reuters, and Washington Post have extensive networks of journalists and sources. They often break significant political news stories before official announcements, thanks to their investigative efforts and connections within political circles. 2. The Significance of the Story: If Joe Biden were to drop out, it would be a monumental story in American politics, especially considering his stature as the incumbent President. Such a decision would have profound implications for the Democratic Party, the presidential election, and the country's political landscape. Given its importance, media outlets would likely invest significant resources in covering any developments related to this story. 3. The Nature of Political Reporting: Political reporting, especially concerning high-profile figures like the President, is highly competitive. Journalists and news organizations strive to be the first to break significant stories, as this can lead to increased credibility, viewership, and readership. This competitive environment incentivizes media outlets to pursue leads aggressively and report on them as quickly as possible. 4. The Role of Unofficial Confirmations: The question specifies that an unofficial confirmation would suffice for the story to be considered covered. This means that the media outlet does not necessarily need an official statement from Joe Biden or his campaign to run the story. Unofficial confirmations can come from a variety of sources, including unnamed officials, people close to the President, or even internal documents. The willingness of media outlets to report on unofficial confirmations increases the likelihood that the story would be covered at least 6 hours before an official announcement. 5. The Possibility of Leaks: In the world of politics, significant decisions like a presidential dropout are often leaked to the press before an official announcement. These leaks can come from disgruntled staff members, political opponents, or even allies trying to gauge public reaction. The presence of leaks in political reporting means that there's a higher chance a reliable media outlet would get wind of the story and report on it before the official announcement. Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that there's a high likelihood a reliable media outlet would cover the story of Joe Biden dropping out at least 6 hours in advance. This is due to the competitive nature of political reporting, the significance of the story, the media's ability to break news early, the role of unofficial confirmations, and the possibility of leaks."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e6032260-93c3-4c55-9b40-2b1c3ad772c5", "title": "Will Donald Trump Jr. be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump Jr. is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Industry Trends and Best Practices: The AI industry is increasingly focusing on safety and transparency. Companies, especially those in the AI sector, are under growing pressure to demonstrate the safety and reliability of their models. External red-teaming, which involves hiring outside experts to attempt to find vulnerabilities in a system, is a recognized method for testing AI model safety. 2. Regulatory Environment: Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are starting to pay more attention to AI safety. There may be current or upcoming regulations that require or strongly encourage companies like Inflection to conduct external safety assessments and publish the results. 3. Company Culture and Commitment to Safety: Inflection's company culture and its publicly stated commitments to safety and transparency will play a significant role. Companies that prioritize these values are more likely to engage in voluntary safety assessments and publish the results to build trust with their users and the broader public. 4. Resource Availability: Conducting external red-teaming and preparing a report for public release requires significant resources, including time, money, and personnel. The availability of these resources and the company's willingness to allocate them to this effort could impact the likelihood of publication. 5. Competitor Actions: If competitors of Inflection have already published or announced plans to publish similar reports, Inflection might feel pressure to follow suit to maintain its competitive position and reputation in the industry. Given these factors, it's reasonable to believe that Inflection might see the value in conducting and publishing an external red-teaming report for safety reasons.

However, Malta has shown the ability to select competitive entries in the past. 3. Competition: The level of competition in the semi-finals is another crucial factor. The number of participating countries and the quality of their entries can significantly impact Malta's chances. Eurovision is known for its unpredictability, and strong entries can come from any participating country. 4. Voting Patterns: Voting patterns, including both jury and public votes, can influence the outcome. Some countries tend to vote more consistently for certain other countries, which can affect the chances of qualification. Malta might benefit from or be disadvantaged by these patterns, depending on the countries in their semi-final. 5. Recent Trends: Recent years have seen a variety of winners and qualifiers, indicating that the contest is open to different styles and newcomers have a chance to succeed. This openness could work in Malta's favor if they present a unique or particularly strong entry.

Malta has had a varied history in Eurovision, with some successful entries making it to the final and achieving high scores, while others have failed to qualify. Serbia has also had its share of successes and failures, winning the contest in 2007 and qualifying for the final several times since then. Given the information available up to April 2024, without knowing the specific entries for Malta and Serbia, it's challenging to predict their chances accurately. However, we can make a general assessment based on historical trends. Both Malta and Serbia have dedicated fan bases and can potentially produce high-quality entries that could appeal to both the jury and the public. The qualification process involves a combination of jury and public voting, which adds an element of unpredictability. Considering these factors, a reasonable approach is to estimate the probability based on their historical qualification rates, taking into account that there are usually around 18 countries competing in each semi-final and roughly half qualify for the final. Historically, both Malta and Serbia have qualified for the final slightly less than half the time they've participated. Without specific details on their entries for 2024, a conservative estimate would place their chances of qualifying slightly below the historical average due to the competitive nature of the contest. However, since the question asks for the probability of either Malta or Serbia qualifying, we need to consider the combined probability of at least one of them making it through.

Franchise Popularity and Momentum: Both Deadpool and Wolverine are highly popular characters within the X-Men franchise, which has a significant following. The success of previous films, especially 'Deadpool,' indicates a strong fan base eager for new content. 2. Marketing and Hype: The announcement of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' likely generated substantial buzz, given the team-up of two fan-favorite characters. Effective marketing campaigns leveraging their popularity could enhance the box office performance. 3. Competition and Market Conditions: The box office landscape at the time of 'Deadpool & Wolverine's' release will impact its performance. Other major releases around the same period could either overshadow it or, conversely, create a favorable environment if there's less competition. 4. Critical Reception and Word-of-Mouth: Early reviews and audience feedback will significantly influence the film's box office trajectory. Positive word-of-mouth can lead to sustained success, while negative reception might dampen performance. 5. Evolution of Viewing Habits: Since the release of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine,' audience viewing habits have evolved, with streaming services becoming more prevalent. This shift could affect box office numbers, as some viewers might opt for a home viewing experience over theaters. 6. Combined Appeal: The novelty of seeing both Deadpool and Wolverine in a single film might attract a broader audience, including those who are fans of one or both characters and are curious about their interactions. Considering these factors, the probability that the domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will be higher than that of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' combined leans towards being more likely than not, due to the combined appeal of the characters, potential marketing hype, and the generally strong performance of superhero team-up movies.

Understanding the Source: The question references 538's national polling average for the 2024 presidential election. 538 (FiveThirtyEight) is a reputable source known for its statistical analysis, especially in the realm of politics and elections. Their polling averages are based on a comprehensive aggregation of polls from various sources, adjusted for factors like the quality of the poll, sample size, and the time the poll was conducted. 2. Interpreting the Polling Average: The question specifically asks about Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden as reported on July 15, 2024. The lead is defined as a positive value if Trump is ahead and a negative value if Biden is leading. The question resolves based on whether Trump's lead is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points. 3. Factors Influencing Polling Averages: Several factors can influence polling averages, including significant political events, debates, economic changes, and even the methodology of the polls included in the average. However, without specific information about events occurring around July 15, 2024, it's challenging to predict how these factors might impact Trump's lead. 4. Historical Context and Volatility: Polling averages can be volatile, and leads can fluctuate significantly over short periods. Historical data from previous elections show that leads of 2-3 points are relatively small and can easily change with the normal ebb and flow of a campaign. 5. Predicting the Future: Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future polling results and the absence of specific details about the political landscape on July 15, 2024, making a precise prediction about Trump's lead is challenging. Considering these points, the best approach is to acknowledge the uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes. However, without specific data or events to analyze, we lean towards a probabilistic answer that reflects the inherent unpredictability of future polling results. Probability: 0.25 This probability reflects a general uncertainty and the understanding that predicting a specific range of lead in a polling average far in advance is subject to a wide range of variables and uncertainties.

Understanding the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS): This index measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index over the next three months. It's calculated based on the prices of options on the S&P 500 and reflects market expectations of near-term volatility. 2. Year-over-Year (YoY) Comparison: We're comparing the VXVCLS value on July 20, 2024, to its value on July 20, 2023. For the question to resolve to 'YES,' the 2024 value must be higher than the 2023 value. 3. Factors Influencing Volatility: Several factors can influence market volatility, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, financial crises, and policy changes. Market sentiment and unexpected events can also significantly impact volatility. 4. Historical Context and Trends: Historically, volatility indices can fluctuate widely. Periods of high volatility can be followed by periods of relative calm, and vice versa. Economic conditions, such as inflation, interest rates, and growth expectations, can also influence volatility. 5. Predicting Volatility: Predicting future volatility is inherently challenging due to the unpredictable nature of market-moving events. However, looking at recent trends and the overall economic environment can provide some insights. Given these considerations, predicting with certainty whether the VXVCLS will be higher on July 20, 2024, than it was on July 20, 2023, is difficult. However, we can consider the current economic environment and market sentiment. - If the global economy is experiencing or is expected to experience significant stress, uncertainty, or major geopolitical tensions are rising, we might expect volatility to increase. - Conversely, if the economic outlook is stable or improving, with low inflation and stable interest rates, volatility might decrease. Without specific data on the current (as of the question's resolution date) economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, or market sentiment, it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, given the natural fluctuations in market volatility and the tendency for periods of high volatility to arise in response to significant market stressors, there's always a potential for an increase in volatility indices over time, especially in a year-over-year comparison.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average: - Historical Context and Polling Trends: As of the question's creation on July 9, 2024, Trump was leading Biden by 2.4 points. Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors including political events, economic conditions, and public opinion shifts. However, significant changes in a short period (in this case, 6 days from July 9 to July 15) are less common unless prompted by a major event. - Predictive Challenges: Predicting polling numbers with such specificity (a lead greater than 2 but less than or equal to 3) is challenging due to the inherent volatility of public opinion and the margin of error in polling data. - Assessment: Given the short timeframe and the specificity of the margin, without any significant events that could drastically alter public opinion, the probability of Trump's lead falling within this exact range might be considered moderate.

(b) The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) being higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024: - Market Volatility and Economic Conditions: Market volatility can be influenced by a wide range of factors including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment.

Combined Assessment: Considering both components of the question, the specificity and the inherent uncertainties involved in predicting both polling averages and market volatility indices make it challenging to assign a high probability to either event occurring by its respective date.

These individuals have more direct political experience and, in some cases, broader appeal within the party and beyond. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has shown a willingness to nominate non-traditional candidates, as evidenced by Donald Trump's nomination and subsequent presidency. However, the party also has a history of favoring candidates with political experience, especially at the state or federal level, which Carlson lacks. 4.

While he has gained national attention for his leadership and policies, particularly among Republicans and independents, his national profile and political capital might not be as prominent as other potential or declared candidates for the Republican nomination. 2. Competitive Landscape: The field for the Republican nomination can be quite crowded, potentially including well-known figures such as former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and other governors, senators, and political personalities. The competition for the nomination is fierce, and Suarez would need to significantly elevate his national profile and appeal to a broad base of Republican voters to be competitive. 3. Republican National Convention Processes: The nomination process involves state primaries and caucuses, culminating in the Republican National Convention where delegates officially select the party's nominee. Suarez would need to perform well in the primaries and caucuses to accumulate enough delegates to make a viable bid for the nomination at the convention. Considering these factors, while Francis Suarez has shown political acumen and leadership in his role as Mayor of Miami, the leap to becoming the Republican nominee for President is substantial. The competition is fierce, and Suarez's current national profile and political resources might not be sufficient to overcome more established figures within the party.

For event (a), Francis Suarez is currently the Mayor of Miami and has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination. However, the field of potential candidates is still large, and it's difficult to predict who will ultimately be selected as the nominee. That being said, Suarez has gained some national attention and has been building a reputation as a rising star in the Republican Party. For event (b), FiveThirtyEight's election forecast is a well-respected and widely-followed predictor of election outcomes. As of the current date, it's difficult to predict what the forecast will look like on July 19, 2024, but we can look at current trends and polling data to make an educated guess. Currently, Biden's approval ratings are relatively low, and Trump's popularity within the Republican Party remains high. However, it's still early in the election cycle, and a lot can change between now and July 2024. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of either event (a) or event (b) occurring as follows: Event (a): Francis Suarez being selected as the Republican nominee - 10% (Suarez has a chance, but the field is still large and uncertain) Event (b): FiveThirtyEight projecting Joe Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024 - 40% (Biden's approval ratings are low, but the election cycle is still early and a lot can change) To calculate the overall probability of either event occurring, we can use the formula: P(either event) = P(event a) + P(event b) - P(both events) Since the events are independent, we can assume that P(both events) is approximately 0.

Given the large size of Elon Musk's proposed pay package ($57 billion), ISS might scrutinize it closely. ISS often evaluates executive compensation based on factors such as alignment with performance, peer comparison, and shareholder value creation. If ISS concludes that Musk's pay package does not align with these principles, it could advise shareholders to vote against it. Regarding the re-election of Kimbal Musk to the Tesla board of directors, ISS would likely assess his independence, contributions to the board, and whether his presence on the board is in the best interest of shareholders. If ISS finds any issues with his re-election that do not align with good governance practices, it might recommend against his re-election. However, without specific details on ISS's evaluation criteria for this particular case or any precedent that ISS has set with similar recommendations in the past, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction.

Will the linked market get at least 377 traders by the end of July 15? To estimate this probability, we should consider the current number of traders in the market, the growth rate of traders, and the time remaining until July 15. However, without specific data on the current number of traders and the historical growth rate, it's challenging to provide a precise estimate. Markets on platforms like Manifold can experience varied growth rates depending on their visibility, the interest in the topic, and the overall activity on the platform. Given the lack of specific data, a moderate estimate might place the probability of reaching 377 traders by July 15 at around 0.5, assuming steady but not explosive growth. 2. Will ISS advise Tesla shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $57 billion package OR the re-election of Kimbal Musk? ISS (Institutional Shareholder Services) provides recommendations to shareholders based on its analysis of corporate governance, executive compensation, and other issues. Its advice on executive compensation packages and board elections is based on criteria that include alignment with shareholder interests, performance-based conditions, and independence of the board. Given Elon Musk's significant influence over Tesla and the large size of his compensation package, ISS might scrutinize these aspects closely. Additionally, the re-election of Kimbal Musk could be evaluated based on his performance and independence as a board member. Without knowing ISS's specific criteria and how they apply to Tesla's situation, estimating this probability involves some guesswork. However, considering ISS's role in promoting shareholder interests and good governance practices, and given the potential for scrutiny around large compensation packages and board independence, a moderate estimate might place the probability of ISS advising against either the compensation package or Kimbal Musk's re-election at around 0.6. Given these estimates, the probability of both events occurring (the market reaching 377 traders and ISS advising against either the compensation package or Kimbal Musk's re-election) would be the product of the individual probabilities: 0.5 (market reaching 377 traders) * 0.6 (ISS advising against) = 0.3.

Taylor Swift Cameo in 'Deadpool & Wolverine': There has been no official announcement or credible rumor strongly suggesting Taylor Swift will appear in 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' While Taylor Swift is known for her surprise appearances and collaborations in various projects, her involvement in a film like 'Deadpool & Wolverine' would likely be a significant departure from her usual public persona and professional endeavors. Given the lack of evidence and the specificity of the claim, it's reasonable to consider this event unlikely. 2. Domestic Box Office Opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine': The original 'Deadpool' film was a groundbreaking success, known for its unique marketing strategy and the popularity of the character. 'The Wolverine,' while not as successful as 'Deadpool,' still performed well. The combination of these two characters in one film could potentially attract a large audience, especially considering the success of superhero movies in recent years. However, predicting box office success involves many variables, including marketing, competition at the time of release, and audience reception. Given the popularity of the characters and the general trend of superhero movies performing well, it's plausible that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could have a strong opening. However, surpassing the combined openings of the individual films is a high bar, especially considering the original 'Deadpool' was a surprise hit and 'The Wolverine' had a dedicated fan base. Given these considerations, while there's potential for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' to do well at the box office, the specific condition of surpassing the combined openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' is ambitious. The lack of information about Taylor Swift's involvement makes the first condition seem unlikely. The question requires both conditions to be met, which makes it even less likely given the uncertainty around each individual condition. Without concrete evidence or strong indicators for either condition, the probability leans towards the lower end of the spectrum."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "88f1fa27-e9bd-4eba-becf-1db11730d892", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Taylor Swift cameos in Deadpool and Wolverine (b) The domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is higher than \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine\" combined?", "body": "(a) Resolves YES if Taylor Swift appears in the movie \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" in any role, even if it is just her voice used for a character.

Historically, the United States has been very dominant in Olympic basketball. The Men's team has won 16 gold medals, and the Women's team has won 9 gold medals, with both teams having a significant winning streak in recent Olympics. However, the landscape of international basketball has been changing, with other countries investing heavily in their basketball programs and improving significantly. Despite this, the US has a deep talent pool and a strong organizational structure for basketball, which includes the NBA and WNBA, arguably the best professional leagues in the world. For the Men's team, the competition has become fiercer, with countries like Argentina, Spain, Australia, and more recently, European teams showing they can challenge and occasionally beat the US team in international competitions. However, the US Men's team has a strong track record of rising to the occasion and has not lost an Olympic gold medal since the introduction of NBA players in 1992, except for a bronze medal finish in 2004, which was an anomaly they quickly rectified. The Women's team has been even more dominant, with their last loss in the Olympics being in 1992. They have a strong collegiate and professional system feeding into the national team, and despite growing competition, they have maintained a high level of performance. Given this background, the probability of both teams winning gold would be high, but not a certainty. Factors such as team chemistry, coaching, injuries, and the specific draw of the tournament can all play a role. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many sports and training programs, which could have unpredictable effects on team performance. Considering these factors, a reasonable estimate for the US winning both gold medals would be around 70%.

The probability of winning gold could be slightly higher, around 70%. To simplify, let's take an average probability for both teams winning gold, which is (60% + 70%) / 2 = 65%. Condition 2: The Philadelphia 76ers are crowned the champion of the 2024 NBA Finals. The NBA is highly competitive, with several strong teams vying for the championship each year. Predicting a winner far in advance is challenging due to factors like team dynamics, player injuries, and potential trades. The Philadelphia 76ers have been a solid team but have not won an NBA championship since 1983. Without significant roster changes or improvements, it's difficult to predict them as clear favorites. Given the competitive nature of the NBA, let's assign a probability of the 76ers winning the championship at around 5%, considering they are not the current favorites and the difficulty in predicting future team performance. Now, to find the probability of both conditions happening (Team USA winning gold in both basketball events and the Philadelphia 76ers winning the 2024 NBA Finals), we multiply the probabilities of each condition happening: Probability = Probability of Team USA winning both golds * Probability of 76ers winning the NBA Finals = 65% * 5% = 0.65 * 0.05 = 0.0325. Reasoning: As explained above, combining the probabilities of two separate events requires multiplying their individual probabilities, leading to a final probability of 0.0325."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "a3a15a6d-1b87-42e1-95d6-7d2a8fa8d61c", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Team USA wins both Men's and Women's 5v5 basketball gold medals at the Paris Olympics (b) The Philadelphia 76ers win the 2024 NBA Finals?", "body": "(a) Resolves Yes if Team USA wins both gold medals in Men's and Women's 5v5 basketball at the Paris Olympics.

Cyprus has also had notable successes, especially with entries like 'Fuego' by Eleni Foureira in 2018, which came close to winning. However, both countries' performances can vary significantly from year to year, depending on the artist, song, and staging. The Eurovision Song Contest format involves two semi-finals, from which the top 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final, based on a combination of jury and public votes. This system makes it possible for countries with a strong appeal to either juries or the public (or both) to advance. Considering these factors, without knowing the specific entries for 2024, it's challenging to predict with certainty. However, given the past performances and the ability of both countries to produce competitive entries, we can make an educated guess. Malta and Cyprus both have the potential to produce high-quality entries that could appeal to voters.

However, without specific data on past trends in this particular election cycle, it's challenging to predict future movements accurately. 2. Margin of Error: Polling averages come with margins of error, which can affect the interpretation of the lead. A lead of 2 to 3 points might be within the margin of error, making it statistically insignificant. 3. Time Frame: The question pertains to a specific date, July 15, 2024. Events leading up to this date, including debates, policy announcements, or significant news stories, could influence polling numbers. 4. Source Reliability: FiveThirtyEight is a reputable source for polling averages, known for its rigorous methodology in aggregating and analyzing polls. However, the quality and number of polls available can impact the reliability of the average. 5. Campaign Dynamics: The dynamics of the Trump and Biden campaigns, including their strategies, funding, and voter engagement, can influence polling numbers. However, predicting these dynamics months in advance is highly speculative. Given these considerations, predicting the exact lead within a narrow range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) on a specific date is challenging.

Current Polling Data: As of the question's creation on July 4, 2024, Trump is leading by 2.4 points. This is within the specified range but closer to the lower bound. 2. Polling Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological differences among polls. However, significant shifts within a short period (11 days in this case) are less common, especially in averages like 538's, which are designed to smooth out outliers and minor fluctuations. 3. Trend Direction: Without access to the most current data or trends, it's challenging to assess whether Trump's lead is increasing or decreasing. However, given the relatively stable nature of polling averages unless there's a significant event, we might expect stability around the current figure. 4. Margin of Error: Most polls and polling averages come with a margin of error, typically around 2-3%. Given Trump's current lead is at the lower end of our target range, small fluctuations could easily move it outside the specified bounds. 5. Political Events and News: The period leading up to July 15 could include political events, announcements, or unexpected news that might influence public opinion. Such factors are inherently unpredictable and could impact polling numbers. Considering these factors, while Trump's current lead falls within the specified range, the potential for volatility and the inherent uncertainty of political polling suggest caution. The margin of error in polling and the unpredictability of political events could easily shift Trump's lead outside the 2 to 4-point range in either direction. Given the current data and the inherent uncertainties, a moderate probability seems appropriate. However, without specific details on the trend direction or significant events that could influence public opinion between now and July 15, 2024, we lean towards a somewhat conservative estimate."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d6920f0e-9daf-4472-b35f-48ab5e28f339", "title": "Will the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15?

Political Involvement and Popularity: Donald Trump Jr. has been actively involved in politics, particularly in advocating for his father's policies and supporting various Republican candidates. He has a strong following among some segments of the Republican base, partly due to his alignment with his father's political stances and his own efforts in promoting conservative causes. 2. Potential Competitors: The field of potential Republican nominees for the 2024 election could be quite crowded. Other prominent figures such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and possibly even Donald Trump himself might seek the nomination. The presence of well-established politicians with strong track records and broader appeal within the party and beyond could significantly dilute Trump Jr.'s chances. 3. Current Political Landscape: The Republican Party is currently navigating internal divisions, and the choice of nominee could reflect a desire for unity, electability, and the ability to attract a broad coalition of voters. While Trump Jr. has his supporters, it's uncertain whether he could unite the party behind him, especially considering potential competition from more experienced and possibly more electable candidates. 4. Experience and Electability Concerns: A significant factor in choosing a presidential nominee is the perception of their ability to win the general election. Compared to other potential candidates, Trump Jr. lacks direct political experience, having never held elected office. This could be seen as a liability by party leaders and delegates looking for a candidate with a proven track record of governance and broader appeal. Considering these factors, while Donald Trump Jr. has a dedicated following within the Republican Party, the competition from more established and potentially more electable candidates, combined with concerns about his own experience and broad appeal, make his nomination less likely."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "2236623c-2dc1-4047-9a47-4044b47e2b41", "title": "Facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, will Trump gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents?", "body": "There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6.

Understanding the Polls: There are two polls on Manifold. One poll pits Donald Trump against Joe Biden, and the other pits Trump against a generic Democrat. The question asks whether Trump will gain at least 3% more votes among Manifold respondents when facing Joe Biden compared to facing a generic Democrat. 2. General Public Opinion: Public opinion polls show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, but other Democrats hypothetically surveyed poll ahead or within the margin of error. This suggests a specific disadvantage for Biden in the general public's perception compared to other Democrats. 3. Manifold Respondents Representation: The question hints at whether Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. If they are, we might expect to see a similar pattern where Biden performs worse than a generic Democrat against Trump. 4. Resolution Criteria: The market resolves YES if Trump's percentage of votes in the poll against Biden exceeds his percentage in the poll against a generic Democrat by 3% or more. The formula provided calculates Trump's percentage of votes in relation to the total votes for Trump, the Democrat in question, and 'Someone else.' Given these points, let's consider the factors that could influence the outcome: - Specificity of the Candidate: Joe Biden, as a specific candidate, might have a different appeal or lack thereof compared to a generic Democrat. The general public's perception of Biden being less favorable than a generic Democrat could potentially translate to Manifold respondents, affecting Trump's performance in the poll against Biden. - Manifold Respondents' Representation: If Manifold respondents closely mirror the general public's opinions, we might see a similar disadvantage for Biden, potentially leading to Trump gaining more votes in the poll against Biden. However, without specific data on how Manifold respondents have voted in similar scenarios or how closely they align with general public opinion, we must consider the uncertainty of how these factors will play out. Given the general trend of public opinion and assuming Manifold respondents might reflect this trend to some extent, it seems plausible that Trump could gain more votes against Biden compared to a generic Democrat. However, the key is whether this gain will be at least 3%, which introduces a level of uncertainty. Therefore, considering the potential for Trump to perform better against Biden due to Biden's perceived disadvantage in public opinion, but also acknowledging the uncertainty in translating general public opinion to Manifold respondents and the specific 3% margin, a cautious estimate would lean towards a higher probability of Trump gaining at least 3% but with a recognition of the uncertainty involved."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "84cf8162-ae01-4e15-8389-40a5102ff6b8", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Donald Trump Jr. becomes the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (b) Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat?", "body": "(a) Donald Trump Jr. will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election if he is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee.

As of my last update, the conflict in Ukraine has been ongoing for several years, with both sides experiencing gains and losses. The situation around Chasiv Yar, specifically, would depend on the broader context of the war, including any significant offensives or counteroffensives by either side, changes in military support from international backers, and the effectiveness of each side's military strategy and tactics. Given the dynamic nature of the conflict and the numerous variables involved, predicting control of a specific location months in advance is highly speculative. However, we can consider a few general points: 1. Russia's Military Presence and Strategy: Russia's ability to maintain or gain control of areas in Ukraine would depend on its military strength, strategic decisions, and the level of support or resistance it encounters from local populations and Ukrainian forces. 2. Ukraine's Military Capabilities and Counteroffensives: Ukraine's ability to retake or maintain control of its territory would depend on its military capabilities, strategic decisions, and the level of international support it receives. 3. International Diplomacy and Support: The level and nature of international support for Ukraine, including military aid, economic sanctions against Russia, and diplomatic efforts, could significantly influence the situation on the ground. Given these considerations and the inherent unpredictability of war, making a precise probability estimate is challenging. However, considering the conflict's history and the potential for shifts in military momentum and international support, a cautious estimate might lean towards a lower probability of Russian control, acknowledging the potential for Ukrainian counteroffensives and international pressure on Russia.

First, let's consider the situation in Chasiv Yar. As of my knowledge cutoff, the conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, and the control of various territories, including Chasiv Yar, has been contested. Given the dynamic nature of military conflicts, it's difficult to predict with certainty who will control Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024. However, considering the recent trends and the fact that the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map is regularly updated to reflect changes in territorial control, I would estimate that the likelihood of Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, is around 0.4. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This scenario is highly speculative and would require significant legal developments. While there have been discussions and debates about the possibility of Trump being disqualified from holding public office under the 14th Amendment, the likelihood of this actually happening is low. I would estimate the likelihood of Trump being removed or blocked from the ballot as around 0.1. Since the question resolves as 'Yes' if either of these events occurs, we need to calculate the combined probability of these events.

Past Influence and Popularity: Donald Trump has had a significant impact on the Republican Party and maintains a strong base of supporters. His presidency and post-presidency have kept him in the public eye, and he has a robust social media presence, which he uses to communicate directly with his supporters. 2. Current Republican Party Dynamics: The Republican Party is currently divided between those who are staunchly loyal to Trump and those who wish to move the party in a different direction. Trump's influence over the party's direction and his ability to endorse candidates who then go on to win primaries have been notable. 3. Potential Challengers: While there are potential challengers within the party, such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others, Trump's decision to run would significantly impact the dynamics of the primary. His strong base of support and ability to command media attention would make him a formidable candidate. 4. Legal and Financial Investigations: Trump is facing several legal and financial investigations, which could potentially impact his decision to run or his viability as a candidate. However, it's also possible that these investigations could galvanize his base further. 5. Election Fatigue and Voter Sentiment: Voter sentiment and election fatigue could play a role. The political landscape is highly polarized, and Trump's candidacy would likely energize both his supporters and his detractors. Given these considerations, while there are factors that could work against Trump's nomination, such as internal party opposition and external legal pressures, his strong base of support, influence over the party, and the potential for him to command the media narrative suggest that he has a significant chance of being the Republican nominee if he chooses to run."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "aa4d9b34-fb5e-455d-98fe-ca8677c27b64", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) be higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024, and (2) Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(1) This question will resolve as **Yes** if the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) reported by the St. Louis Fed on July 20, 2024, is greater than the reported number on July 20, 2023.

Given this precedent, it's reasonable to expect debates to continue as part of the electoral process. 2. Number of Candidates and Competitive Nature: As of my last update, there are notable potential Democratic nominees, including those mentioned (Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, Biden, etc.). The presence of multiple candidates often necessitates debates to help voters differentiate between them, suggesting a likelihood of debates. 3. Democratic Party's Interest in Transparency and Voter Engagement: The Democratic Party has traditionally emphasized voter engagement, inclusivity, and transparency. Hosting debates aligns with these values, providing a platform for candidates to engage with a broad audience. 4. The Role of the Democratic National Committee (DNC): The DNC typically oversees the debate process, including setting criteria for participation and scheduling debates. The DNC's actions and decisions will significantly impact whether debates occur. 5. Public Demand for Debates: Voter interest and public demand for debates could influence the decision. If there's significant public interest in hearing from candidates in a debate format, this could push the DNC and candidates towards organizing debates. 6. The 2024 Election Landscape: The context of the 2024 election, including the issues at stake, the competitive nature of the race, and the desire for party unity, could influence the necessity and feasibility of debates. Considering these factors, it seems likely that there will be another Democratic party presidential debate.

As of the last available information, there was no clear indication that President Biden intended to step down or forgo the nomination. Thus, without specific evidence or context indicating otherwise, the likelihood of this event seems low. (b) Regarding another Democratic party presidential debate, these events are common during primary seasons, especially when there are multiple candidates vying for the nomination. However, the Democratic party's decision to hold another debate would depend on various factors, including the number of viable candidates, the competitive landscape, and the proximity to the Democratic National Convention. Given the relatively late stage in the primary process (considering the resolution date is in August 2024 and the Democratic National Convention is presumably in the summer of 2024), if there hasn't been a debate announced or held by the time this question is being considered, the window for scheduling and holding another debate before the convention is narrowing. Still, the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if there's a competitive primary race. Considering both components, the likelihood of either event occurring is difficult to predict with certainty, but based on historical patterns and the context provided, it seems more plausible that there could be another Democratic party presidential debate than Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the nomination. However, given the specificity of the conditions (especially the timing for Biden's announcement and the narrowing window for a debate before the convention), the overall probability leans towards the lower end of the spectrum but still acknowledges the inherent unpredictability of political events."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.23047258451691144, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.05761814612922786, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7079849932176355, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given that the market has about 11 days to reach the target (from July 4 to July 15), we can estimate the required daily growth rate.

Condition 1: ICC issues arrest warrants for listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024. The ICC issuing arrest warrants for high-profile individuals such as heads of state or government is a significant and relatively rare action. Given the political sensitivity and the legal hurdles involved, the likelihood of the ICC taking such a step before a specific deadline seems relatively low. Condition 2: A terrorist act occurs in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics. While the risk of a terrorist act cannot be eliminated entirely, the increased security measures during the Olympics would significantly reduce the likelihood of a successful attack.

Regarding event (a), the ICC issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders is a complex process that involves several steps, including preliminary investigations, authorization to open an investigation, and issuance of arrest warrants. Given the timeline and the complexities involved, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether this will happen by July 1, 2024. However, considering the ICC's history and the current geopolitical context, it's not entirely improbable. Regarding event (b), the occurrence of a terrorist act in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics, this is a concern for any major international event. France has faced terrorist threats in the past and has a robust security apparatus in place to mitigate such risks. However, despite the best efforts of security agencies, the risk of a terrorist act cannot be entirely eliminated. Given these considerations, we must assess the likelihood of either event occurring. Both are possible but not certain, and their probabilities are difficult to quantify with precision due to the complexity and unpredictability of geopolitical and security events. However, for the purpose of providing a reasoned estimate, let's consider the following: The ICC's process for issuing arrest warrants is lengthy and involves significant legal hurdles, making it less likely to happen by a specific deadline without significant prior developments. Terrorist acts, while possible, are relatively rare events, especially in countries with high levels of security preparedness like France during a major international event. Given these considerations, while both events are plausible, their likelihood is not extremely high. However, the nature of these events means that even a low probability is significant due to the potential impact. Therefore, considering the uncertainties and complexities involved, a reasoned estimate might place the probability of either event occurring slightly above the very low end of the spectrum, acknowledging the real but not overwhelming likelihood of these significant events."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.19175885693490463, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04793971423372616, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6144447090352879, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Will Hurd as the Republican Nominee: As of my last update, Will Hurd is a relatively lesser-known figure in the national political landscape compared to other potential Republican nominees like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others. The Republican nomination process is complex, involving state primaries and caucuses that lead up to the Republican National Convention. Historically, the nomination often goes to candidates who have higher national profiles, more resources, and more significant support from the party establishment and base. While Hurd has a compelling background, including being a former CIA officer and a moderate Republican, his path to the nomination seems challenging given the current field of contenders. 2. Donald Trump Testifying at the Hush Money Trial: The likelihood of Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial is uncertain and depends on various legal factors, including whether he is required to testify by a court order. Trump's legal team has typically fought such requests vigorously. However, if the court demands his testimony, he would likely have to comply, albeit possibly through a remote or deposition-style arrangement rather than in-person courtroom testimony. Given these considerations, let's estimate the probabilities: - Will Hurd being the Republican nominee seems unlikely, given his current standing and the nature of the Republican primary field. I'd estimate this at around 5%, considering the unpredictable nature of political campaigns and the fact that the Republican field may evolve. - Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial is somewhat more plausible due to the ongoing legal proceedings and the potential for a court to demand his testimony. However, given his history of avoiding such testimonies and the efforts his legal team would make to prevent it, this still seems less likely than more. Let's estimate this at around 10%. Combining these probabilities under the assumption of independence (which is not perfectly accurate since both are influenced by broader political and legal currents, but it serves as a rough approximation), the probability that at least one of these events occurs would be: 1 - (Probability neither happens) = 1 - (0.95 * 0.90) = 1 - 0.855 = 0.145 Therefore, the estimated probability is 14.5%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04833228607316681, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.012083071518291702, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3113034595042769, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Still, historical data on polling averages might suggest that such a scenario could occur with a moderate probability, especially if the campaign dynamics do not shift dramatically. Event (b) concerns Tim Scott becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This outcome is highly uncertain and subject to numerous factors, including the outcomes of primaries, the strategies of other candidates, and the preferences of the Republican National Convention delegates. Given the early stage of the election cycle and the large field of potential candidates, predicting any single candidate to become the nominee with high confidence is difficult. However, it's worth noting that as of the last update, Tim Scott has not been among the most frequently mentioned front-runners, which might imply a lower probability compared to other potential nominees. Considering both events, we must estimate the probability of either occurring. Given the specificity of event (a) and the high uncertainty of event (b), it seems reasonable to assign a moderate to low probability to the combined outcome. Event (a) has a somewhat bounded uncertainty due to its specific criteria, whereas event (b) is highly uncertain due to the inherent unpredictability of political nominations. Therefore, taking into account the difficulty in predicting both events with high confidence, but acknowledging that there is a clear pathway for each to occur, the probability should reflect a balanced assessment of these uncertainties."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.056957177181117424, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) Francis Suarez as the Republican Nominee: Francis Suarez is the current Mayor of Miami and has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination in 2024. However, as of my last update, he has not officially announced his candidacy. The Republican field for 2024 is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates potentially running, including former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and several current or former governors and senators. Given the current landscape, it's difficult to predict with certainty who will emerge as the Republican nominee. However, Suarez's lack of national recognition and the presence of more established candidates in the field make it challenging for him to secure the nomination. (b) Democratic Party Brokered Convention: A brokered convention occurs when no candidate secures the majority of delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot, leading to multiple rounds of voting. This can happen when there is a large field of candidates, and no single candidate can garner enough support to win outright. The Democratic Party has made changes to its nomination process to try to avoid a brokered convention, such as allowing states to award delegates proportionally rather than winner-takes-all. However, if there is a large and competitive field of candidates, it's still possible that no candidate could secure the majority of delegates needed to win on the first ballot.

Firstly, as of my last update, the specific polling data for July 15, 2024, is not available, which means we have to rely on historical trends and the understanding that polling averages can fluctuate over time due to various factors such as political events, candidate performance, and changes in public opinion. Given the nature of polling averages, a lead of greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4 points is a relatively narrow margin, indicating a competitive race. Historical data from 538's national polling averages show that margins in presidential races can fluctuate significantly over time, influenced by a wide range of factors including major political events, debates, and campaign strategies. Moreover, the closer we get to the election, the more stable polling averages tend to become, but July 2024 is still far enough from the election date that significant shifts in public opinion could occur. Considering these factors, making a precise prediction is challenging without current data. However, based on the general trends and the understanding that polling averages can be volatile but tend to stabilize closer to the election, we can make an educated guess.

Current Political Standing: As of my last update, Larry Elder is known as an American conservative talk radio host, author, politician, and attorney who was a candidate in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election. While he has a following and has been involved in significant political activities, his national profile and political experience might not be as extensive as other potential candidates. 2. Competitive Landscape: The Republican Party has several high-profile figures who could potentially run for the presidency in 2024, including former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and other prominent politicians. The competition for the nomination is expected to be fierce, with several candidates having broader national recognition and potentially stronger political machinery behind them. 3. Selection Process: The Republican nominee is selected by delegates at the Republican National Convention. This process involves a series of primaries and caucuses where candidates compete for delegate votes. The ability to win a majority of these delegates across various states is crucial for securing the nomination. Considering these factors, while Larry Elder has a political presence and could potentially attract a segment of Republican voters, the field of potential candidates for the 2024 Republican nomination is likely to be highly competitive, with several candidates having more established national profiles and political infrastructures.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average: Historical Context and Polling Trends: As of my last update, polling data can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors, including political events, economic conditions, and candidate popularity. A lead of greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4 points suggests a relatively tight race but with a slight edge for Trump. Polling Margin Variability: Polling averages can shift due to changes in public opinion, but they also have margins of error. A consistent lead within such a narrow range suggests a race where public opinion is fairly stable but slightly leaning towards Trump. Assessment: Given the variability in polling data and the specific range required (greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4), this event seems somewhat unlikely due to the precise nature of the margin required. However, without current data, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. Historically, such narrow margins are not uncommon in close races, but sustaining them over time is less predictable. (b) Larry Elder being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Primary Elections and Candidate Popularity: The outcome of primary elections can be highly unpredictable and is influenced by numerous factors, including candidate popularity, fundraising capabilities, debate performances, and voter turnout. Larry Elder's Standing: Without current polling data or information on the Republican primary race dynamics, it's challenging to assess Larry Elder's chances accurately. However, if Elder is not among the top-tier candidates in terms of polling, fundraising, or national recognition as of the last update, his chances would be considered lower compared to more prominent figures in the party. Assessment: Given the lack of information suggesting Larry Elder is a front-runner or has significant party backing, this event seems unlikely. However, primary races can be highly volatile, and underestimating outsider candidates can be a mistake, as evidenced by past electoral surprises. Combining the Probabilities: Given the above assessments, both events occurring seems highly unlikely. The first event, concerning Trump's lead, is somewhat unpredictable due to the nature of polling averages and the narrow margin specified. The second event, concerning Larry Elder's nomination, appears unlikely without evidence of strong support within the party or significant national recognition. Reasoning: Both events are individually somewhat to highly unlikely, and when combined, the probability of both occurring is even lower due to the multiplication of their individual probabilities."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "0a62c6d6-e47f-4539-9a49-a7e925202121", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, or (b) Larry Elder be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's [national polling average for the 2024 presidential election](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/) as reported on the chart for the date of July 15, 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024.

Sports like association football (soccer), basketball (both 3x3 and 5x5), field hockey, handball, rugby sevens, volleyball, and water polo have different global footprints and competitive levels. 2. Global Competitiveness: The global competitiveness in women's sports has been increasing, with more countries investing in women's sports programs. However, certain nations have historically dominated in specific sports, largely due to cultural popularity, investment in infrastructure, and long-standing programs. For example, the United States has been strong in basketball and soccer, while the Netherlands has a strong presence in field hockey. 3. Historical Performance: Looking at past Olympics, it's not uncommon for a few nations to win multiple gold medals across team sports. The United States, for instance, has a strong record in several team sports. 4. New Entrants and Upsets: Every Olympic cycle, there are new entrants or teams that significantly improve, potentially causing upsets. However, the nature of team sports often sees established teams perform well due to experience and team dynamics. 5. Event-Specific Factors: Each sport has its nuances that can affect outcomes, such as rule changes, venue specifics, and how teams adapt to the Olympic environment. Considering these factors, while there is a broad range of competitors and the possibility of upsets, historical trends suggest that at least one nation will likely win more than one gold medal in the women's team sports at the 2024 Olympics.

On the other hand, if the political landscape has been relatively stable, it's possible that her odds may remain steady or even decrease. It's also worth noting that Nate Silver's model is based on a complex set of algorithms and data, and it's difficult to predict exactly how the model will respond to new information.

The next presidential election is scheduled for November 2024, which would naturally end his term if he does not win re-election or is not a candidate. 2. Impeachment or Resignation: Short of the natural end of his term, a president can leave office early due to impeachment and removal, resignation, or incapacitation. As of my last update, there were no widely recognized or imminent proceedings for impeachment that had gained significant traction or were expected to result in his removal from office before the end of July 2024. Similarly, there were no public indications that President Biden intended to resign. 3. Health Concerns: President Biden's health has been a subject of public interest due to his age. However, as of my last update, there were no publicly disclosed health issues that would indicate he would be unable to continue in his role through the end of July 2024. 4. Term Limitations: President Biden is eligible to serve his full term until January 2025, unless re-elected for a second term in the 2024 elections. Considering these factors, there are no clear indications as of my last update that President Biden would not be president by the end of July 2024.

His influence over the Republican voter base is considerable, and he has been vocal about his intentions to run again in 2024. 2. Political Climate: The political climate within the Republican Party has been highly polarized, with Trump supporters making up a large and vocal segment. However, there are also factions within the party looking for alternatives to Trump, citing concerns over his electability and the controversies surrounding his presidency. 3. Potential Competitors: Several other Republicans have expressed interest or have been mentioned as potential candidates for the 2024 nomination. These include former Vice President Mike Pence, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, among others. The strength of these candidates and their ability to challenge Trump for the nomination will play a crucial role in determining the outcome. 4.

Trump's ability to mobilize his base and secure delegates in various states will be crucial. His past experience with the process and his continued popularity among a significant portion of Republican voters are advantages.

Event 1: Donald Trump is selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. As of my last update, the Republican Party's nomination process for the 2024 presidential election has not concluded, and several factors could influence the outcome, including primary election results, delegate counts, and party dynamics. However, without current polling data or primary results, it's challenging to assign a precise probability to Trump's nomination. Historically, Trump has maintained a strong base within the Republican Party, but the nomination process can be unpredictable. For the sake of estimation, let's consider a moderate probability reflecting his significant influence within the party but also accounting for uncertainties and potential challengers. Event 2: On July 21, 2024, the closing value of BSE SENSEX is greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k. Predicting the exact range of a stock market index like the BSE SENSEX on a specific future date is inherently difficult due to the numerous factors that can influence market movements, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and global health crises. The range specified (greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000) is relatively narrow, making the prediction even more challenging. Stock markets can exhibit significant volatility over short periods, and long-term predictions are generally less reliable. Given these considerations, the probability of the BSE SENSEX closing within this specific range on July 21, 2024, is relatively low due to the inherent unpredictability of stock markets. Combining the Probabilities: To find the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening. Without precise data, assigning exact probabilities is speculative, but for illustrative purposes, let's assume a moderate probability for Trump's nomination (e.g., 0.4, reflecting a competitive nomination process) and a lower probability for the BSE SENSEX condition (e.g., 0.1, given the narrow range and market unpredictability). The combined probability would be 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04.

Trump's Previous Behavior: Donald Trump has a history of being vocal and defensive in public about various allegations against him. However, this behavior does not necessarily indicate a willingness to testify under oath in a trial setting. 3. Legal Strategy: Trump's legal team might advise against testifying to avoid potential risks, such as being caught in a lie under oath or providing evidence that could be used against him. The strategy could be to rely on other witnesses and evidence to build the defense. 4. Public and Political Considerations: Given Trump's political career and potential future ambitions, his team might weigh the political implications of testifying. Testifying could be seen as a bold move, but it could also expose him to further scrutiny and criticism. 5.

However, his legal team might argue that his testimony is not necessary or relevant, especially if they believe other witnesses or evidence can adequately address the allegations.

This format means that qualification is not solely dependent on the quality of the performance but also on the voting dynamics, which can be unpredictable. 3.

A catchy, well-performed song can significantly increase a country's chances of qualifying. However, without knowing the specific entry for 2024, it's challenging to assess this factor accurately. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geopolitical factors, cultural affinity, and diaspora voting patterns. Iceland might benefit from some of these patterns, particularly if their song resonates with specific voter groups, but this is speculative without knowing the song. 5. Randomness and Unpredictability: Eurovision outcomes are notoriously unpredictable. Factors like performance order, staging, and the mood of the audience and juries on the night can significantly impact results. Given these considerations, it's challenging to provide a precise probability without knowing Iceland's entry and the specifics of the competition. However, considering the general factors: - Historical performance suggests a moderate chance. - The competition format and voting patterns introduce unpredictability. - The quality of the song and artist is a significant unknown variable. Given these factors, a cautious approach is to estimate a probability slightly above the midpoint, reflecting the unpredictability of the contest and the lack of specific information about Iceland's entry."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "27e681fa-b1f5-4d64-b3fe-94e7f99ee0d1", "title": "Will both Albania and Iceland qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following occur: (a) Albania participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, and (b) Iceland participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Current Political Standing: As of my last update, Donald Trump remains a significant figure within the Republican Party. Despite losing the 2020 presidential election, he has maintained a strong base of support among Republican voters. This support is crucial in primary elections, where voter turnout is often lower, and the most dedicated and partisan voters have a disproportionate influence. 2. Potential Challengers: The field of potential challengers to Trump within the Republican Party is broad. Figures like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence have been mentioned as possible contenders. However, as of now, none of these potential candidates have officially announced their candidacy or demonstrated the same level of grassroots support as Trump. 3. Political Climate: The political climate leading up to the 2024 election is expected to be highly polarized. Issues such as the economy, healthcare, immigration, and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be central to the election. Trump's stance on these issues resonates with a significant portion of the Republican base, which could help him secure the nomination. 4. Republican National Convention: The nomination process at the Republican National Convention is key. Delegates are often party loyalists, and their selection of a nominee can sometimes diverge from the preferences of the broader electorate. However, in recent years, the convention has largely ratified the choice of the primary voters. Considering these factors, while there are certainly challenges to Trump's nomination, including potential legal issues and the emergence of strong challengers, his current standing within the party and his ability to connect with the Republican base make him a strong contender for the nomination."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "df086ce3-0d7a-4737-8bce-a63fec36b351", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) On July 21, 2024, will the closing value of BSE SENSEX be greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k?

First, let's look at Albania's past performance. Albania has participated in Eurovision since 2004 and has had mixed results. They have qualified for the Grand Final several times, most recently in 2021, but have also failed to qualify in some years. Their performance suggests that while they have the potential to create songs and performances that appeal to voters, they are not among the strongest or most consistent competitors in the contest. The Eurovision contest format involves semi-finals from which the top 10 countries, based on a combination of public and jury voting, progress to the Grand Final. The competition is fierce, with many countries investing heavily in their entries and employing strategic tactics to appeal to a broad audience. The use of both public and jury voting means that songs need to appeal to both the general public and music industry professionals, making it a challenging competition to predict. Given Albania's history and the competitive nature of the contest, it is difficult to confidently predict their qualification without knowing the specific details of their entry, such as the song and performance. However, past performance can give us some indication. Assuming Albania is participating with a song of similar quality to their recent entries, we can consider their qualification rate over the past few years as a rough guide. Without detailed information about the 2024 entry, it is reasonable to assume that Albania has a chance of qualifying, but it is by no means a certainty.

Past Performance: Moldova has participated in Eurovision since 2005 and has qualified for the Grand Final several times, most notably coming third in 2017 with 'Hey, Mamma!' by SunStroke Project. Their performance has been somewhat inconsistent, but they have shown the ability to produce songs that appeal to both juries and the public. 2. Current Trends: Eurovision voting trends can shift due to various factors, including changes in musical tastes, political considerations, and the composition of the jury panels. In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend towards rewarding songs with strong musicality, unique staging, and emotional resonance. Moldova would need to select an entry that aligns with these trends to increase its chances. 3. Contest Format and Rules: The Eurovision format involves two semi-finals, from which the top 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final based on a combined vote from a professional jury and public televoting. Any changes to the voting system or the way countries are allocated to semi-finals could potentially impact Moldova's qualification chances. 4. Entry Selection Process: Moldova's method for selecting its Eurovision entry can significantly affect its chances. Some years, Moldova has used a national final (e.g., O melodie pentru Europa), while in others, the entry has been selected internally. The success of the entry often depends on the quality of the song and performance selected through this process. Considering these factors, predicting Moldova's qualification with certainty is challenging without knowing the specifics of their 2024 entry, the entries of competing countries, or any potential changes to the contest format.

Past Performances: Both Moldova and Australia have had mixed results in Eurovision. Moldova has qualified for the Grand Final several times, most notably coming third in 2017 with 'Hey Mamma' by SunStroke Project. Australia, since its debut in 2015, has consistently qualified for the Grand Final until 2021, when Montaigne failed to qualify with 'Technicolour.' This history suggests both countries have the potential to qualify, but there's variability in their success. 2. Current Trends in Music: Eurovision song styles and preferences can vary significantly from year to year. If either Moldova or Australia submits an entry that aligns well with current musical trends and tastes, their chances of qualifying could increase. However, without knowing the specific entries for 2024, this factor remains speculative. 3. Competition Format and Voting System: The Eurovision semi-finals are divided into two groups, with countries allocated to either semi-final through a draw. The voting system, which includes both jury and public votes, can also influence outcomes. Changes to these systems could affect countries' chances, but as of my last update, no significant changes to the format or voting have been announced for 2024. Given these considerations, we can look at the general qualification rates for countries. Historically, about half of the countries in each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final. However, countries like Australia have had higher qualification rates since their debut, despite a recent miss.

Meta's commitment to AI safety: Meta has been actively involved in AI research and development, and like other major tech companies, it has emphasized the importance of AI safety. This commitment suggests a motivation to engage in practices like external red-teaming to ensure the safety of their AI models. 2. Industry trends and peer pressure: The AI industry has seen a trend towards more transparency and collaboration on safety issues. Companies like Google and Microsoft have engaged in various forms of safety assessments and collaborations. This trend might encourage Meta to follow suit, including publishing results from external red-teaming. 3. Regulatory environment: There's a growing call for regulation around AI, especially concerning safety and transparency. Anticipating or responding to regulatory pressure, Meta might choose to proactively engage in and publish external red-teaming exercises to demonstrate compliance and commitment to safety. 4. Public and stakeholder expectations: The public and stakeholders increasingly expect tech companies to be transparent about their AI practices, including safety measures. Publishing a report on external red-teaming could be seen as a way for Meta to meet these expectations and maintain trust. 5. Internal capacity and resource allocation: Whether Meta has the internal capacity and resources allocated to conduct and publish such a report by June 30, 2024, is crucial. Large companies often have the resources, but prioritization and internal processes can affect the timing. 6. Potential risks and downsides: Publishing a report on external red-teaming might expose vulnerabilities or issues with Meta's AI models, which could impact public perception or even lead to regulatory scrutiny. This might deter or delay such publication. Considering these factors, while there are incentives for Meta to engage in and publish external red-teaming exercises for their AI models, the decision to do so publicly by a specific date involves complexities of internal priorities, potential risks, and the evolving regulatory and public expectation landscape. Given the current trends and the factors mentioned, I would estimate the probability of Meta publishing a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, as follows:"}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "dba77d13-a72a-4c9c-a205-ee875582110b", "title": "Will the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15?

Trade Relations and Policies: The EU has been actively engaged in protecting its domestic industries, including the automotive sector, from what it considers unfair trade practices. This includes imposing tariffs or duties on imports that are deemed to be subsidized or dumped in the EU market at below market prices. Given the strategic importance of the EV sector for the EU's green transition and industrial policy, there is a strong incentive to ensure a level playing field for domestic manufacturers. 2. Electric Vehicle Market Dynamics: The global EV market is rapidly expanding, with China being a leading producer and exporter of electric vehicles. Chinese EV manufacturers have been making significant inroads into the global market, including the EU, with competitive pricing that has raised concerns among European manufacturers about unfair competition. 3. Recent Developments and Investigations: The EU has mechanisms in place to investigate allegations of dumping or unfair subsidies. If there have been recent investigations into Chinese EV imports, this could indicate a higher likelihood of tariffs being imposed. 4. Political and Economic Considerations: The decision to impose tariffs also involves political considerations, including the potential impact on trade relations with China, the effect on EU consumers (who might face higher prices for EVs), and the overall economic implications. Given these factors, the likelihood of the EU announcing new tariffs or duties on Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024, could be considered moderate to high. This is because the EU has a track record of protecting its industries, and the EV sector is of strategic importance.

Previous Announcements and Trends: Disney often uses the D23 Expo as a platform to announce new attractions and expansions. Given the popularity of Moana and the trend of incorporating successful franchises into theme park attractions, there's a reasonable expectation that such an announcement could happen. 2. Moana's Popularity: Moana has been a significant hit for Disney, both critically and commercially. Its themes, characters, and music have resonated with audiences worldwide, making it a prime candidate for theme park integration. 3. Magic Kingdom's Expansion and Updates: Magic Kingdom, like other Disney parks, continuously evolves to incorporate new attractions and themed areas to keep the experience fresh for visitors. Given the park's layout and the ongoing trend of updating and expanding existing lands, there's potential for a Moana-themed ride to be part of future plans. 4. Competition and Market Demand: The theme park industry is highly competitive, with parks constantly looking for ways to attract new visitors and keep repeat visitors engaged. A Moana-themed ride would likely generate significant interest and could be seen as a strategic move to maintain or increase market share. 5. D23 as a Platform for Announcements: D23 is a major event where Disney fans and investors expect significant announcements. Given the anticipation and the tradition of making impactful announcements at D23, if a Moana ride is in development for Magic Kingdom, it's plausible that D23 2024 would be the chosen platform for its reveal. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Disney announcing a new Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024 seems reasonable, especially given the franchise's popularity and the strategic importance of continually updating the park's attractions. However, without insider information or leaks, it's impossible to be certain. The estimate must balance between the plausible reasons for such an announcement happening and the inherent uncertainty of predicting corporate decisions."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "7b7e4eb5-5f21-40ec-8b2b-c74e464836e2", "title": "Will Deadpool & Wolverine have biggest opening weekend ever for R-rated movie?

Mike Pence, as the former Vice President under Donald Trump, has a significant profile and could be a contender. However, his chances depend on various factors, including his decision to run, his campaign's strength, and the overall field of candidates.

Regulatory Compliance: The European Union has been actively working on regulations that impact AI services, notably the AI Act. The AI Act aims to ensure that AI systems, including chatbots like ChatGPT, comply with EU standards on safety, transparency, and accountability. For ChatGPT to be generally available in the EU, OpenAI must ensure that it complies with these regulations. Given the complexity and the evolving nature of these regulations, there's a risk that OpenAI might face challenges in meeting all the requirements by June 30, 2024. 2. OpenAI's Strategic Plans: OpenAI has shown a keen interest in expanding its services globally, including to the EU. However, the company also needs to balance its expansion plans with regulatory compliance and ethical considerations. OpenAI might strategically choose to delay full availability in the EU if it believes that meeting the regulatory requirements will take longer than anticipated. 3. Current Status and Technical Challenges: As of the last available information, ChatGPT has faced restrictions in certain EU countries due to concerns over data privacy and the potential for the service to be used in ways that violate local laws. For general availability, OpenAI needs to address these concerns, which might involve technical updates to the service, changes in how user data is handled, or agreements with local authorities. Considering these factors, while OpenAI is likely working towards making ChatGPT available in the EU, the path to general availability by June 30, 2024, is fraught with regulatory, strategic, and technical challenges.

This suggests that Chung has the capability to produce high-quality films that critics appreciate. 2. **Cast Performance History**: Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones have been involved in successful projects. Powell's performance in 'Top Gun: Maverick' (2022) and Edgar-Jones's role in 'Normal People' (2020) were well-received. The cast's past performances can contribute positively to a film's overall reception. 3. **Sequel Nature**: Being a standalone sequel to a well-known film like 'Twister' (1996) could have mixed effects. On one hand, it may draw in audiences nostalgic for the original. On the other hand, sequels often face the challenge of living up to their predecessors or justifying their existence, which can impact critical reception. 4. **General Trends in Film Criticism**: Critics tend to evaluate films based on their artistic merit, originality, and technical quality, among other factors.

Given the volatility in polling numbers, predicting such a specific outcome months in advance involves considerable uncertainty. (b) Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024: This event's occurrence is subject to geopolitical tensions, strategic considerations, and covert operations, making it inherently unpredictable. The history of Israeli-Iranian relations includes instances of conflict and covert operations, suggesting a plausible scenario but with uncertain timing. The specificity of the attack leading to the death of at least five individuals adds to the complexity of predicting this event accurately. Given the uncertainty and specificity of both predictions, estimating their combined probability requires acknowledging the low likelihood of accurately forecasting such precise outcomes independently. Assuming these events are largely independent (the occurrence of one does not significantly affect the probability of the other), we multiply their individual probabilities.

Still, unforeseen health problems could potentially impact his ability to serve. 2. Political Factors: The political landscape in the United States is highly polarized. However, unless there is a significant shift in political dynamics or a major scandal that directly implicates the President in a manner that forces his resignation or removal (which is a high bar given the requirements for impeachment and removal), it's unlikely that political factors alone would result in him not completing his term. 3. 25th Amendment: The question explicitly mentions that a temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment does not count as a resolution. Therefore, unless Biden permanently steps down due to incapacity, which is not currently indicated, this factor does not significantly impact the probability. 4. Resignation or Death: Without specific reasons to believe otherwise (such as a terminal illness diagnosis or a stated intention to resign), these outcomes are difficult to predict but generally considered low probability given the information available.

Current Polling Trends: As of the question's creation in June 2023, we don't have real-time data, but we can infer that polling numbers can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors, including campaign events, economic conditions, and external global events. 2. Historical Context: In past presidential elections, leads in polls have shifted over time, but a consistent lead of more than 3 points, especially in a general election matchup, is significant. It indicates a notable preference for one candidate over the other among the electorate at that point in time. 3. Polling Margin of Error: Most polls have a margin of error, typically ranging from 2 to 4 percentage points. A lead of greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4 points is within the margin of error for many polls, making it a relatively tight race in terms of statistical significance. 4. Time Until the Election: The question pertains to a date roughly a year after its creation and a few months before the actual election. A lot can change in the political landscape, including the candidates' popularity, due to debates, policy announcements, and unforeseen events. 5. FiveThirtyEight's Methodology: 538's polling average incorporates data from numerous polls, weighing them based on factors like the pollster's quality, sample size, and recency. This methodology provides a comprehensive view of the election landscape but can also be influenced by outliers or a sudden proliferation of polls favoring one candidate. Given these considerations, predicting a specific margin a year in advance is highly speculative. Poll numbers can and do change, often in response to factors that are unpredictable. Therefore, while it's possible that Trump could lead Biden by more than 3 but less than or equal to 4 points on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, the likelihood of such a precise outcome is relatively low due to the inherent volatility of election polling."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a2573c46-2546-404a-bf05-3a2a406da847", "title": "Will Glenn Youngkin be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Glenn Youngkin is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Historical Performance of Swimmers: Historically, swimmers have been among the top medal winners at the Olympics. Swimmers like Michael Phelps, who holds the record for the most gold medals won by an individual in Olympic history, demonstrate the potential for high medal counts in swimming. This suggests a strong precedent for swimmers performing exceptionally well. 2. Number of Events: Swimming offers a wide range of events (50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, and 1500m in each stroke, plus relays and individual medleys), providing numerous opportunities for athletes to win multiple medals. This is in contrast to many other sports that offer fewer medal opportunities. 3. Competition Depth: While swimming is highly competitive, the depth of talent in other sports like track and field, gymnastics, and cycling can also be considerable. However, the sheer number of events in swimming increases the chances of a swimmer accumulating more medals than athletes in other sports. 4. Current Talent Pool: Knowing the current talent pool in swimming as of the 2024 Olympics is crucial. Swimmers like Katie Ledecky and Caeleb Dressel have shown dominance in their respective events, similar to Phelps in his prime. If such dominant swimmers are competing in 2024, the likelihood of a swimmer winning the most gold medals increases. 5. Olympic Program Changes: Any changes to the Olympic program, such as the addition or removal of events, could impact the potential for medal wins in swimming compared to other sports. Considering these factors, the likelihood of a swimmer winning the most gold medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics appears strong, given the historical performance of swimmers, the broad range of events offering multiple medal opportunities, and the presence of dominant swimming athletes."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "35dab4c5-db9c-47e7-aa4a-71739325b605", "title": "At the 2024 Olympics, will at least 5 countries win their debut gold medal?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if 5 or more countries win their first-ever Olympic gold medal at the Paris Olympics, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).", "resolution_date": "2024-08-11T18:20:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-16T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.55, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal at the 2024 Olympics, let's break down the reasoning step by step: 1. Historical Context: First, it's essential to look at the historical trend. At each Olympic Games, there are usually a few countries that win their first-ever gold medal. This can happen for various reasons, such as improvements in training, new sports or events being added, or simply the natural fluctuation in performance levels among athletes. 2. Number of Participating Countries and Athletes: The number of countries and athletes participating in the Olympics has been increasing over the years. With more participants, there's a higher chance of countries winning their first gold medal. However, this also means the competition gets fiercer, which can counterbalance the increased number of opportunities. 3. New Sports and Events: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has added new sports and events to the Olympic program for the 2024 Paris Olympics. This could provide opportunities for countries that have a strong tradition in these new additions but haven't won gold in other Olympic sports. 4. Global Development of Sports: The global development of sports, including investment in sports infrastructure and training programs, means that athletes from more countries are now capable of achieving high-level success. This could lead to an increase in the number of countries winning their first gold medal. 5. Statistical Analysis: While a detailed statistical analysis would require more specific data on participating countries, athletes, and past performances, a rough estimate based on past trends can be made. For example, if we look at the past few Olympics, it's common for around 2-4 countries to win their first-ever gold medal at each Games.

Historical Context: It's helpful to look at past Olympics to see the trend of new countries winning their first gold medals. Over the past few Olympics, there has been a steady but small number of countries achieving this milestone. For instance, at the 2016 Rio Olympics, 3 countries won their first gold medals, and at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the number was slightly higher, with 5 countries achieving this feat. 2. New Sports and Events: The inclusion of new sports and events at the Olympics can significantly impact the chances of countries winning their first gold medals. The 2024 Paris Olympics will introduce breakdancing as a new sport, among other additions. New sports often bring new countries to the forefront, increasing the chances of debut gold medals. 3. Global Talent Spread: The spread of athletic talent around the globe has been increasing, with more countries investing in sports infrastructure and training programs. This global spread of talent increases the likelihood of new countries winning medals, including gold. 4. Competition Intensity: The Olympics feature the best athletes from around the world, making the competition extremely intense. While there are many talented athletes from countries that have not yet won a gold medal, the leap to winning a gold medal is significant and requires not just talent, but also experience, top-notch training, and often a bit of luck. 5. Statistical Approach: Without a clear pattern or a comprehensive statistical model that can accurately predict the outcome based on historical data, we must rely on general trends and the understanding of the factors influencing Olympic outcomes. Given these considerations, the estimation of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal seems plausible but challenging. The introduction of new sports and the global spread of talent support the possibility, but the historical context and the intense competition provide caution."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d5a3abc2-4614-4fe5-8088-290cf1cfe330", "title": "Will Individual Neutral Athletes Win \u226515 Gold Medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Individual Neutral Athletes collectively win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

Event (a): \"House of the Dragon\" S2E8 Rated >8.5 on IMDB - Historical Context: IMDB ratings for \"House of the Dragon\" have shown a range from 8.0 to 9.3 for Season 1 and 6.1 to 9.6 for Season 2 episodes. This indicates a general positive reception but with significant variability. Season Finale Expectations: Season finales often receive higher ratings due to their conclusive nature and the resolution of plot arcs. However, this is not a guarantee, as the quality of the episode and fan expectations play crucial roles. IMDB Rating Mechanism: IMDB ratings can fluctuate over time and are subject to various biases, including fan bias and the timing of reviews (early reviews might be more extreme). Given these considerations, while it's plausible that the season finale could receive a high rating, the strict threshold of >8.5 introduces some uncertainty. High-quality episodes that meet fan expectations can achieve such ratings, but external factors like trolls, overly high expectations, or divisive plot choices could lower the rating. Event (b): M. Night Shyamalan's \"Trap\" (2024) Receives a CinemaScore of B or Above - M. Night Shyamalan's Track Record: Shyamalan has a mixed track record with CinemaScores, ranging from B+ for \"Split\" to C+ for \"Old\" and C for \"Knock at the Cabin\". This variability suggests that while he can produce well-received films, it's not a consistent outcome. CinemaScore Significance: CinemaScore reflects immediate audience reaction, which can be influenced by expectations, marketing, and the overall cinema experience. Considering Shyamalan's recent films, achieving a B or higher is possible but not guaranteed. His films often have unique twists, which can polarize audiences, leading to a range of CinemaScores. Combined Probability: To calculate the combined probability of both independent events occurring, we multiply their individual probabilities. Assuming Independence: The success of one event does not directly influence the other since they are related to different media and creators. Individual Probabilities: Event (a) might have a slightly higher probability due to the general positive reception of \"House of the Dragon\" and the potential for a well-received season finale. Let's estimate this at around 0.6 (60% chance), considering the strict >8.5 threshold. Event (b) is harder to predict due to Shyamalan's mixed track record. A cautious estimate might place this at around 0.45 (45% chance), given the range of his recent CinemaScores. Calculation: Combined Probability = Probability of Event (a) * Probability of Event (b) = 0.6 * 0.45 = 0.27.

One possible scenario that could lead to an increase in Harris's odds is a strong performance in the polls. If Harris were to gain ground in key battleground states or show significant improvement in national polls, Silver's model might adjust her odds upward. Additionally, if there were a major development in the campaign, such as a high-profile endorsement or a notable mistake by an opponent, it could also impact Harris's chances.

Given the inherent uncertainty in predicting election outcomes, it's difficult to make a confident prediction.

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) advises Tesla shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $57 billion package OR the re-election of Kimbal Musk: ISS is a leading provider of corporate governance solutions and proxy advisory services. Their recommendations are influential among institutional investors, and they often focus on governance issues, executive compensation, and board composition. Given Elon Musk's significant influence over Tesla and the controversies surrounding his compensation package, it's plausible ISS could advise against it, especially if they perceive it as not aligning with shareholder interests. Similarly, ISS might scrutinize Kimbal Musk's re-election due to concerns about board independence and family ties within the company's leadership. However, predicting ISS's stance with certainty is challenging, as their recommendations are based on detailed analyses of company performance, governance practices, and peer comparisons. While there's a basis for potential opposition due to governance and compensation concerns, ISS's actual advice could go either way based on their comprehensive evaluation. 2. Donald Trump Jr. is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of my last update, the Republican field for the 2024 presidential election was not yet fully defined, and while Donald Trump Jr. has been involved in political activities and could be a potential candidate, predicting his nomination is highly speculative. The outcome depends on numerous factors, including the field of candidates, the primary election process, and the preferences of Republican voters. Given these considerations, assessing a precise probability for Donald Trump Jr. becoming the nominee involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The dynamics of political campaigns can shift rapidly due to a wide range of factors, including candidate performance, voter sentiment, and external events. Combining these assessments: Given the speculative nature of both components, especially the second one concerning Donald Trump Jr.'s potential nomination, we are dealing with two uncertain events. The first event, concerning ISS's advice, has a somewhat more contained set of outcomes based on past practices and governance principles. However, predicting ISS's exact stance is still challenging. The second event, concerning Donald Trump Jr.'s nomination, is highly uncertain and subject to the unpredictable dynamics of political campaigns. Therefore, when considering the likelihood of both events occurring (ISS advising against Elon Musk's package or Kimbal Musk's re-election AND Donald Trump Jr. being the Republican nominee), we are compounding uncertainties, which naturally leads to a lower overall probability. Probability: Given the speculative nature of these events, especially the political nomination, and the inherent uncertainty in predicting ISS's recommendations, I would assess the combined probability as relatively low, likely in the range of 0.05 to 0.15. This reflects the compounded uncertainties and the specific, somewhat unlikely, nature of both events occurring as described.

It's plausible ISS could advise against it if they perceive it as not aligning with shareholder interests. Regarding Kimbal Musk's re-election, if his performance or independence is questioned, ISS might advise against it, but this seems less likely than advice against the compensation package. Event (b): Donald Trump Jr. Becomes the Republican Nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This depends on various factors, including his decision to run and the preferences of Republican voters. As of the last update, there was no clear indication that he intended to run.

(a) The Crimean Bridge is hit with an attack before July 1, 2024: The Crimean Bridge, a strategic and symbolic connection between Russia and Crimea, has been a target in the past, notably in October 2022 when it was hit by a truck bomb. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine increases the likelihood of such strategic assets being targeted. Given the bridge's importance and the past attempts to disrupt it, there is a plausible scenario in which it could be attacked again. However, predicting such specific events with high confidence is challenging due to the numerous variables involved, including security measures, military strategies, and the dynamics of the conflict. (b) Joe Biden is still president by the end of July 2024: As of the question's creation in May 2024, Joe Biden is the President of the United States. For him not to be president by the end of July 2024, several unlikely events would have to occur, such as resignation, incapacitation, or removal from office. Given the stability of the U.S. political system and the procedures in place for the transition of power, any sudden change within such a short timeframe is improbable without extraordinary circumstances. Combining the Probabilities: Given these considerations, we can assign a moderate to high probability for the first event (attack on the Crimean Bridge) due to the ongoing conflict and past precedents, but with a recognition of the unpredictability of specific military actions. For the second event (Joe Biden still being president), we can assign a high probability due to the stability of the U.S. political system and the improbability of sudden changes. Let's assign a rough estimate of 0.4 for the first event (reflecting a moderate chance but with significant uncertainty) and 0.9 for the second event (reflecting a high level of confidence in the stability of the U.S. presidency). The combined probability of both independent events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.4 * 0.9 = 0.36.

Joe Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election, and his campaign is already underway. Resigning from the presidency would also be an extraordinary step, typically reserved for extreme circumstances. As of my last update, there has been no credible indication from Biden or his administration that he intends to take such drastic actions. Political decisions of this magnitude are usually the result of careful consideration and strategy, and it would be highly unusual for them to be announced without prior signals or leaks. Furthermore, the timing of such an announcement would be peculiar, given the proximity to the election and the potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances. The party would need to scramble to find a new candidate, which could put them at a disadvantage.

These factors include economic indicators, monetary policies, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. 1. Economic Indicators: The strength of the US economy compared to Japan's can significantly impact the USD/JPY exchange rate. Indicators such as GDP growth, inflation rates, employment rates, and trade balances can influence the value of the dollar relative to the yen. If the US economy is expected to grow stronger than Japan's by August 2024, this could support a higher value of the USD against the JPY. 2. Monetary Policies: The interest rate differential between the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is a crucial driver of the USD/JPY exchange rate. Higher interest rates in the US compared to Japan can attract more investment to the US, increasing demand for the dollar and thus its value against the yen. As of the last update, the Fed has been on a path of tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, while the BoJ has maintained a more accommodative stance. 3. Geopolitical Events and Market Sentiment: Global events, political tensions, and market sentiment can also impact the exchange rate. The USD often acts as a safe-haven currency during times of global uncertainty, which can drive up its value against other currencies, including the JPY. Given these considerations, predicting the exact value of the USD/JPY exchange rate by August 9th, 2024, involves significant uncertainty.

(a) Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President: As of my last update in early 2023, Joe Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election but has not made a formal announcement. The decision for a sitting president to seek re-election is complex and influenced by numerous factors, including health, popularity, potential opponents, and party support. Given Biden's age and the scrutiny of his health, there's speculation about his capacity to serve another term. However, unless there's a significant health issue or a major scandal, it's unlikely he would announce not seeking re-election before the specified date, as such announcements typically happen after considerable deliberation and strategic planning. The Democratic Party would also likely encourage Biden to seek re-election if his popularity and health are perceived as assets rather than liabilities. Probability of (a) occurring: 0.15 (b) Chris Christie being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Chris Christie, a former governor of New Jersey and a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, has maintained a national profile but faces significant challenges in securing the Republican nomination. The Republican field for 2024 is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates potentially running, including former President Donald Trump, who, if he runs, would significantly alter the dynamics of the primary. Christie's path to the nomination would require him to outperform in debates, build a strong campaign apparatus, and navigate the complex web of Republican Party politics, all while likely facing opposition from Trump and other formidable opponents. Probability of (b) occurring: 0.05 To find the probability that either event occurs, we can use the formula for the union of two events, which is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Assuming that the events are independent (Biden's decision to run and Christie's nomination are not directly dependent on each other), P(A and B) would simply be P(A) * P(B). P(A or B) = 0.15 + 0.05 - (0.15 * 0.05) = 0.15 + 0.05 - 0.0075 = 0.1925 Reasoning: Based on the analysis of both events, considering the factors that would lead to Joe Biden not seeking re-election and Chris Christie securing the Republican nomination, the combined probability takes into account the low likelihood of each event happening and adjusts for the near impossibility of both happening together."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0035529663124657662, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0008882415781164416, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08678874530901011, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

There are several factors to consider: 1. Biden's intentions and past statements: As of my last update, Joe Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election. There has been no strong indication from him or his administration that he plans to drop out of the race or resign from office. 2. Health and personal factors: The health and personal well-being of the President could be a factor in such decisions. However, without specific information indicating a significant health issue or personal crisis that would lead to resignation and dropping out of the election, it's difficult to speculate on this basis. 3. Political and strategic considerations: From a political standpoint, announcing resignation and dropping out of the election would have significant implications for the Democratic Party, including the need to rapidly find a new candidate and the potential impact on the party's unity and electoral prospects. Such a decision would likely be made with considerable consultation within the party and would need to be strategically advantageous, which seems unlikely given the potential for disruption and the advantage it could give to political opponents. 4. Historical precedent: There is no strong historical precedent for a U.S. President to both drop out of a re-election campaign and resign from office. While presidents have chosen not to seek re-election or have resigned, doing both simultaneously before the end of their term, especially in the context of an upcoming election, is highly unusual.

Major political shifts or emergencies that could precipitate such a change were not publicly anticipated. 2. Health and Status of the President: The health and status of President Biden are crucial. Unless President Biden is incapacitated or resigns, the transfer of power to Vice President Harris would not occur. As of the last public update, there was no indication of such a scenario. 3. Legal and Constitutional Mechanisms: The transfer of power to the Vice President is governed by the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides for the Vice President to assume the office of the President if the President resigns, is removed from office, or is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office. This amendment also allows the President to temporarily transfer power to the Vice President, who then acts as Acting President. 4. Historical Precedents: While there have been instances where Vice Presidents have assumed the presidency due to the incumbent's resignation or incapacitation, these events are rare and usually occur with some forewarning or under extraordinary circumstances. 5.

Past Behavior and Frequency: Joe Biden has shown a willingness to engage in lengthy interviews, as evidenced by his 70-minute appearance on The Howard Stern Show in April. This indicates that he is open to in-depth conversations, increasing the likelihood of future occurrences. 2. Public Engagement and Media Strategy: As the President of the United States, Biden's public appearances and interviews are strategically chosen to address various audiences and topics. Given the broad range of platforms he can appear on (from podcasts to late-night shows and in-depth news programs like 60 Minutes), there are multiple avenues for such an interview to take place. 3. Political Climate and Necessity: The period leading up to July 2024 is significant in the context of U.S. politics, considering it precedes the presidential election. Biden and his team may see lengthy interviews as opportunities to connect with voters, explain policies, and build a personal rapport with the public, which could be crucial in an election year. 4. Constraints and Limitations: The criteria for this question are quite specific, excluding common formats like press conferences, speeches, and rallies. While this narrows the scope, Biden's past engagements suggest that he does occasionally participate in the types of interviews that would qualify. 5. Timeframe: With the resolution date set at the end of July 2024, there is a considerable window of time for such an interview to occur. Given the frequency of public appearances by political figures, especially in an election year, this timeframe offers ample opportunity. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Joe Biden engaging in an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024 seems relatively high.

(a) Joe Biden has an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024: As the President of the United States, Joe Biden regularly engages in various forms of public communication, including interviews, press conferences, and speeches. However, the specific criterion here is an in-person interview lasting at least 45 minutes. Given that 2024 is an election year, President Biden might be more inclined to participate in longer, more in-depth interviews to reach voters and discuss his policies.

(b) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment has rarely been invoked, and for Trump to be removed, there would need to be a legal determination that he engaged in insurrection, which is a high bar. Given the short timeline until July 15, 2024, and the complexity of legal proceedings, it seems unlikely that a final determination could be made in time. Considering these factors, the probability of (a) occurring seems relatively high, while the probability of (b) occurring seems low.

Past Performance: Georgia has participated in Eurovision since 2007 but has had mixed results. They have qualified for the Grand Final a few times, most notably in 2010 and 2011 with Sofia Nizharadze and Eldrine, respectively. However, their qualification record is not consistent, and they have often missed the final. This mixed bag of past performances doesn't strongly indicate a high probability of qualification. 2. Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the performance of the artist are crucial factors in Eurovision success. Without knowing who the artist is or what the song sounds like for 2024, it's challenging to predict how well they will do. However, if Georgia selects a catchy song with a memorable performance, their chances of qualifying could increase. 3. Competition: The level of competition in Eurovision is high, with many countries sending talented artists with well-produced songs. The competition in the semi-finals, from which countries must qualify for the Grand Final, is particularly fierce. The draw for the semi-finals (which determines the order of performance) can also affect a country's chances, as performing later in the show often results in more votes. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical and cultural factors, with countries often voting for their neighbors or countries with similar cultural backgrounds. Georgia might benefit from votes from neighboring or culturally aligned countries, but this is not a guarantee of qualification. 5. Jury and Public Vote: The outcome is determined by a combination of jury and public votes. The professional juries and the public may have different preferences, which can affect a country's chances. A strong performance might appeal to both, increasing the chances of qualification. Considering these factors, without specific information about Georgia's entry for 2024, such as the song and artist, and acknowledging the high level of competition and unpredictable nature of Eurovision voting, a cautious approach is warranted.

First, we need to understand what 'red-teaming' means in the context of AI safety. Red-teaming is a process where a team, often external to the organization developing the AI, actively tries to find vulnerabilities or exploits in the AI system. This can include attempting to bypass safety protocols, manipulate the AI into producing harmful outputs, or identifying biases that could lead to unsafe behavior. Next, we consider Meta's current stance and practices regarding AI safety and transparency. Meta has been under scrutiny for the safety and ethical implications of its AI technologies, and there has been a growing demand for more transparency and accountability from tech giants regarding their AI research and deployment practices. Given these considerations, let's weigh the factors for and against the likelihood of Meta publishing a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024: For: 1. Public Pressure and Regulatory Scrutiny: Meta, like other tech giants, is under increasing pressure from the public, media, and regulatory bodies to demonstrate accountability and transparency in its AI development practices. Publishing a report on external red-teaming efforts could be seen as a proactive step towards addressing these concerns. 2. Industry Trends: There's a growing trend in the tech industry towards more openness about AI safety and ethics, including the publication of safety audits and assessments. Meta might follow this trend to maintain a competitive edge in terms of public perception of its commitment to safety. 3. Internal Research and Development: Meta invests heavily in AI research, including aspects related to safety and ethics. An external red-teaming effort could complement this internal work, providing additional insights and credibility. Against: 1. Competitive Disadvantages: Publishing detailed reports on vulnerabilities found through red-teaming could potentially give competitors insights into Meta's technology, possibly revealing trade secrets or areas of weakness. 2. Reputation Risk: If the report reveals significant safety issues, it could harm Meta's reputation and public trust, especially if the issues are perceived as severe or if the company's responses are deemed inadequate. 3. Cost and Resource Intensive: Conducting thorough external red-teaming exercises and preparing detailed public reports can be costly and resource-intensive.

Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the artist representing Malta play a significant role in their chances of qualifying. A strong, memorable song performed well can significantly increase a country's chances of making it to the final. 3. Competition: The level of competition in the semi-final Malta is participating in is crucial. Some semi-finals are more competitive than others, depending on the participating countries and their entries. 4.

Historical Performance: Both Croatia and Malta have had mixed results in Eurovision. Croatia has had some successful entries, especially in the early 2000s, but their performance has been inconsistent. Malta, on the other hand, has had a few standout entries but also struggles with consistency. Neither country has been a regular finalist in recent years. 2. Qualification Process: The qualification for the Grand Final is determined by a combination of jury and public votes in the Semi-finals. The top 10 countries from each Semi-final, based on the combined voting, qualify for the Grand Final. This means that the competition is fierce, and qualification is not solely dependent on the quality of the song but also on how it is received by both the professional juries and the public. 3. Recent Trends: Recent years have seen a dominance of certain countries in the qualification process, often due to strong diaspora support, memorable performances, or effective use of social media for promotion. However, both Croatia and Malta have shown potential in these areas, with Croatia having a strong fan base and Malta often presenting visually engaging performances. 4. Song Quality and Performance: The quality of the song and the live performance are crucial factors. Both countries have shown the ability to produce and select competitive entries. However, the competition is highly unpredictable, and what might seem like a strong entry can sometimes fail to connect with the audience or juries. 5. EBU Voting System: The voting system, which combines professional jury votes and public votes, adds an element of unpredictability. The jury tends to favor songs with artistic merit and strong vocal performances, while the public vote can be swayed by a variety of factors, including the performance's entertainment value, the song's catchiness, and the artist's charisma. Given these considerations, while it's difficult to predict with certainty, both Croatia and Malta have the potential to qualify for the Grand Final, especially if they select strong entries and execute their performances well. However, the competition is fierce, and qualification is never guaranteed."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.005148768230993417, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0012871920577483542, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1014823195145212, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
