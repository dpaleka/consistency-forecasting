Current Political Standing: Mike Pence, as the former Vice President under Donald Trump, holds a significant position within the Republican Party. He has a strong conservative record and is well-regarded by many within the party's establishment. However, his popularity and influence have been overshadowed by Trump, and it's unclear how much of Trump's base he could command should he decide to run. 2. Potential Competitors: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could be crowded, with several high-profile figures potentially vying for the spot. This includes Donald Trump himself, should he decide to run again, as well as other prominent Republicans like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Ted Cruz. Each of these candidates could pose a significant challenge to Pence, particularly in terms of fundraising, media attention, and grassroots support. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party is currently deeply influenced by Donald Trump and his supporters. Pence's relationship with Trump and his ability to appeal to Trump's base will be crucial in securing the nomination. However, navigating this dynamic can be complex, especially if Trump decides not to endorse Pence or, more critically, decides to run himself. 4. Historical Context: Historically, former Vice Presidents have had mixed success in their own presidential bids. Pence's ability to carve out his own identity separate from Trump while still leveraging his experience and conservative credentials will be key. Given these considerations, while Mike Pence has a solid foundation within the Republican Party, the competition and the current political landscape present significant challenges. His success heavily depends on Trump's decision regarding the 2024 election and his ability to stand out in a potentially crowded field."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "0791f664-4287-45fc-b228-c4e9ad2e4541", "title": "Will either Vivek Ramaswamy or Mike Pence be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Vivek Ramaswamy or Mike Pence is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, his influence has waxed and waned, and other figures within the party are vying for prominence. 2. Mike Pence's Position: Mike Pence, as the former Vice President under Donald Trump, holds a unique position. He has maintained a lower profile than Trump but has a strong base within the evangelical wing of the party. His actions and statements since leaving office have been cautious, balancing loyalty to Trump with attempts to carve out his own identity. 3. Potential Candidates: The field for the Republican nomination is likely to be crowded. Other potential candidates, such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Ted Cruz, among others, have been mentioned or have shown interest. The dynamics of a crowded field can lead to unpredictable outcomes, as seen in the 2016 primaries. 4. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party is currently divided between those loyal to Trump and those looking to move beyond him. Pence's association with Trump could be both a blessing and a curse, depending on how the party's sentiment evolves. 5. Electability: Pence's perceived electability in a general election could influence his chances. Some might view him as a safer choice than more divisive figures, but others might see him as too closely tied to Trump's policies and controversies.

Health Concerns: As of my last update, President Biden, like many individuals of his age, has had health issues, but none that have indicated an immediate threat to his ability to serve as President through July 2024. His health has been a subject of public scrutiny, but he has shown resilience and an ability to recover from illnesses and maintain his duties. 2. Resignation: There has been no clear indication from President Biden or his administration that he intends to resign. His commitment to serving his term has been consistent, and unless there's an unforeseen circumstance, it's unlikely he would resign before July 2024. 3. 25th Amendment: The question explicitly mentions that a temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment does not constitute a resolution of NO. This means unless President Biden permanently ceases to be President due to incapacity (which would involve a permanent transfer of power, not a temporary one), this scenario does not affect the resolution. 4. Impeachment and Removal: While there have been political tensions and calls for impeachment from some quarters, the process of impeachment and removal by Congress is complex and has a high threshold for success. Given the current political landscape, the likelihood of President Biden being impeached and removed before the end of July 2024 is low. 5. Other Circumstances: Any unforeseen circumstances (such as accidents or sudden severe illness) are inherently unpredictable but are considered low probability given the security, medical care, and scrutiny the President is under. Given these considerations, the probability of President Biden remaining in office through the end of July 2024 is high. While unforeseen events can occur, based on current information and trends, it is reasonable to estimate a high likelihood of him completing this period as President."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "3890bdcd-5680-4da4-bc81-5bfe1275da76", "title": "Will Joe Biden die before Saturday or will he cease to be President before the end of July 2024?", "body": "Resolves YES if either (a) there is an official announcement of Joe Biden's death before market close at the end of Friday, July 26th, or (b) Joe Biden resigns, dies, or otherwise ceases to be US President before the end of July 2024 (ET).

However, the field of candidates for the Republican nomination is expected to be crowded, including prominent figures like Donald Trump, who has also announced his candidacy. 2. Popularity and Recognition: Nikki Haley has a certain level of national recognition, having served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under President Donald Trump and as the Governor of South Carolina. However, her level of recognition and popularity might not be as high as some other potential candidates, particularly Donald Trump, who maintains a significant base of support within the Republican Party. 3. Fundraising Ability: The ability to raise funds is crucial in any presidential campaign. Nikki Haley has shown she can raise money, but competing with the fundraising capabilities of candidates like Trump, who has a proven track record of raising significant amounts of money for his campaigns, will be challenging. 4. Primary Elections and Debates: Performance in primary elections and debates can significantly influence a candidate's chances. Nikki Haley will need to perform well in these arenas to increase her visibility and attract more support. 5. Party Support: The support of the Republican Party establishment can also play a significant role. While Nikki Haley has connections within the party, it's unclear how much official or unofficial support she will receive compared to other candidates.

Potential Field of Candidates: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination is not yet fully defined, but it could include former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and other notable Republicans. Trump's decision on whether to run will significantly impact the race, as he maintains a strong base of support within the party. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has shown a strong inclination towards populist and conservative candidates in recent years. DeSantis's policies and public persona align with these trends, which could make him an attractive candidate to Republican voters. 4. Primary Process: The Republican nomination process involves a series of state primaries and caucuses, culminating in the Republican National Convention. Success in early states can create momentum, but the process also allows for candidates to accumulate delegates over time. DeSantis's ability to fundraise and organize in key states will be crucial. Considering these factors, DeSantis has a strong foundation for a candidacy, but the field is potentially crowded, and Trump's influence looms large.

His presidency and post-presidency have seen a devoted base of supporters who could potentially back him or a family member for the nomination. 2. Donald Trump's Intentions: As of my last update, Donald Trump has hinted at the possibility of running again in 2024.

Other Trump Family Members: While other family members like Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump have been involved in politics to varying degrees, their potential candidacies are less clear. They might have smaller, yet still significant, chances of securing the nomination if they were to run, primarily due to the recognition and support that comes with the Trump name among Republican voters. 4. Challengers within the Party: The Republican Party has several other potential candidates who could challenge a Trump family member for the nomination. The success of these challengers would depend on various factors, including their ability to appeal to the broad Republican base, their fundraising capabilities, and how they navigate the complex dynamics of Republican politics in the shadow of Trump's influence. 5. Historical Context: The Republican Party's nomination process can be unpredictable, with several instances of unexpected candidates gaining traction. However, the party also tends to favor candidates who have run previously or have strong name recognition, which could favor a Trump candidacy. Given these considerations, while there are factors that could lead to a Trump family member securing the Republican nomination, including Donald Trump's own potential candidacy and the family's enduring popularity among a segment of Republican voters, the outcome is far from certain.

First, let's consider Chris Christie's chances of becoming the Republican nominee. Chris Christie, the former Governor of New Jersey, has been involved in Republican politics for many years but has had a mixed relationship with the Trump-dominated Republican Party. While he has a strong political background, his popularity and influence within the party have waned in recent years, especially after his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal and his criticisms of Donald Trump. Given the current field of potential Republican candidates and the party's dynamics, it seems unlikely that Christie would emerge as the nominee. Next, let's consider the possibility of a Trump family member becoming the nominee. Donald Trump, as the incumbent president at the time this question was created (though not at the time of answering), naturally had a significant advantage in terms of name recognition, fundraising capabilities, and support within the party. His family members, particularly Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, have also been floated as potential political candidates in various contexts. However, their actual chances of becoming the nominee are difficult to assess without specific campaigns to evaluate. Given the information available up to my last update in 2023, the most plausible scenario among the options provided for a Trump family member becoming the nominee would involve Donald Trump himself. Despite losing the 2020 presidential election, Trump has maintained a strong base of support within the Republican Party and has indicated interest in running again in 2024. Considering these factors, the likelihood of either Chris Christie or a member of the Trump family becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election hinges largely on Trump's decision and the dynamics within the Republican Party.

Current Political Standing: Vivek Ramaswamy is an entrepreneur and author who has gained attention for his conservative views and criticism of 'woke' culture. However, as of my last update, he does not have a strong political background or widespread recognition within the Republican Party compared to other potential candidates. 2. Competitive Landscape: The Republican field for the 2024 presidential election is expected to be crowded, with several well-known figures potentially running. These include former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and other established politicians with strong party connections and national recognition. The competition for the nomination will be fierce, and Ramaswamy's lack of political experience and lower profile make it challenging for him to stand out. 3. Historical Trends: Historically, the Republican Party has tended to nominate candidates with strong political backgrounds, such as current or former governors, senators, or high-ranking government officials. While there are exceptions, candidates without such backgrounds face significant challenges in securing the nomination. 4. Primary Process: The Republican primary process involves a series of state contests where delegates are allocated based on the results. To win the nomination, a candidate must secure a majority of the delegates. This process often favors candidates with strong organizational capabilities, financial resources, and party support, all of which could be challenging for Ramaswamy to assemble compared to more established candidates. Given these considerations, while it's not impossible for Vivek Ramaswamy to secure the Republican nomination, the odds are against him due to his relatively low profile, lack of political experience, and the competitive nature of the Republican field."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "f0f8f5f2-3f19-4f67-bcce-cc7ca72ce783", "title": "Will Chris Christie be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Chris Christie is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Previous Experience and Recognition: Ted Cruz has run for the presidency before, in the 2016 election. Although he didn't win the nomination, he gained significant national recognition and has maintained a strong profile within the Republican Party. This experience and recognition could be beneficial in another presidential bid. 2. Current Political Climate and Competition: The political landscape is constantly evolving, with new figures emerging and others fading from prominence. The competition within the Republican Party for the nomination could be fierce, especially considering potential candidates like Donald Trump, who has hinted at running again, and other prominent Republicans who might enter the race. 3. Policy Positions and Appeal: Cruz's policy positions and his ability to appeal to a broad spectrum of Republican voters will be crucial. His stance on issues such as immigration, healthcare, and the economy could either alienate or attract different factions within the party. 4. Fundraising and Campaign Infrastructure: The ability to raise funds and build a strong campaign infrastructure is vital for any presidential candidate. Cruz has shown in the past that he can raise significant funds, but the landscape of donors and the strategies for fundraising can shift. 5. Party Dynamics and Convention Process: The Republican National Convention's process for selecting a nominee can be complex and influenced by party dynamics, including the preferences of delegates and party leaders. Cruz's relationship with these stakeholders could play a significant role in his chances of securing the nomination. Given these considerations, while Ted Cruz has a strong profile and experience, the competition and the fluid nature of political races make it difficult to predict with certainty. However, considering his past performance and the potential field of candidates, it seems reasonable to estimate a probability that acknowledges his viability but also the challenges he faces."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e177d31b-cbcb-4b7b-bec0-c8fab81c41e5", "title": "Will Ron DeSantis be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Ron DeSantis is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

While he has a following among certain segments of the Republican base, his appeal is not as broad. 2. Primary Process: The Republican nomination process involves a series of primaries and caucuses across the United States, culminating in the Republican National Convention.

Potential Candidates: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 election is likely to be crowded, including possibly Donald Trump himself, which would overshadow his son's candidacy. Other contenders might include well-established politicians with broader appeal and stronger political machinery. 4. Donald Trump Jr.'s Political Experience and Appeal: Compared to other potential candidates, Donald Trump Jr. lacks significant political experience. His appeal is mostly limited to those already loyal to his father, and it's uncertain whether he can expand his base of support. 5. Historical Precedents: While family members of politicians have successfully followed in their relatives' footsteps, the path to the presidency, especially through a major party nomination, is extremely challenging without strong political credentials or a unique national appeal.

This support is crucial in primary elections, where voter turnout is often lower and more partisan. 3. Potential Challengers: While there are other significant figures within the Republican party who could potentially challenge Trump (e.g., Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley), Trump's early announcement of his candidacy and his continued popularity among a significant portion of the Republican base pose significant hurdles for challengers. 4. Legal and Financial Factors: Trump faces several legal challenges, which could potentially impact his ability to campaign effectively or could lead to legal disqualification, though the latter seems less likely. Financially, Trump has a strong fundraising capability, which is crucial for a successful campaign. 5.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update, Glenn Youngkin is known for winning the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, which drew national attention. However, the field for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination is expected to be crowded, including potential candidates with higher national profiles and broader bases of support. 2. National Recognition and Support: While Youngkin has gained recognition for his gubernatorial win, he may not have the same level of national recognition or support as other potential candidates. The Republican Party tends to nominate candidates who are well-known nationally and have a strong base of support across multiple states. 3. Primary Election Dynamics: The Republican primary process is complex and involves multiple states with different voter demographics and preferences. Candidates who perform well in early states tend to gain momentum in later states. Youngkin's ability to perform well across a broad range of states is untested at this level. 4. Fundraising and Endorsements: Successful presidential candidates typically have strong fundraising capabilities and endorsements from key figures within their party. Youngkin's ability to raise funds and secure endorsements compared to other candidates is an important factor. 5. Party Convention Dynamics: The Republican National Convention's selection process can sometimes be unpredictable, with delegates occasionally diverging from the outcomes of primary elections. However, this is rare and usually occurs when no candidate has a clear majority of delegates. Considering these factors, while Glenn Youngkin has shown political viability in Virginia, the field for the 2024 Republican nomination is expected to be highly competitive, with several candidates potentially having stronger national profiles and broader support bases. Youngkin's path to the nomination would require him to significantly expand his national recognition and support, outperform other candidates in the primaries, and navigate the complexities of the party convention effectively."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a8ca8042-acd8-48ea-ab2c-0ac70395ef5b", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

His influence within the party and his ability to raise funds are considerable factors. Despite controversies and legal challenges, Trump has consistently maintained a high level of popularity among a segment of Republican voters. 2. **Glenn Youngkin's Rise**: Glenn Youngkin, the Governor of Virginia, has been gaining attention for his potential as a national candidate. His victory in Virginia, a state that has trended Democratic in recent years, has been seen as a significant win for Republicans. Youngkin's ability to appeal to both Trump supporters and more moderate Republicans could make him a formidable candidate. 3. **Other Potential Candidates**: The field for the Republican nomination could include other notable figures such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence, among others. The dynamics of the primary process, including debates, fundraising capabilities, and voter turnout, will significantly influence the outcome. 4. **Primary Process and Delegate Selection**: The Republican National Convention's delegate selection process is crucial. The ability of candidates to win over delegates in various states, under different rules (e.g., winner-takes-all vs. proportional allocation), will determine the nominee. Trump's previous experience with this process could be an advantage. 5. **Political Climate and Voter Sentiment**: The political climate in 2024, including issues like the economy, foreign policy, and social issues, will influence voter preferences. Candidates who can best align themselves with the prevailing sentiments of Republican primary voters will have an advantage. Given these considerations, while it's early to predict with certainty, both Glenn Youngkin and Donald Trump have significant advantages that could propel them to the nomination. Trump's established base and Youngkin's broad appeal make them both strong contenders. However, the unpredictable nature of primary elections, the potential for other strong candidates to emerge, and the ever-changing political landscape mean that while they have notable advantages, nothing is assured."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.028835269454083295, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.009611756484694431, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.24065547555594477, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current Political Standing: As of my last update, Francis Suarez is the Mayor of Miami, Florida. While he has gained national attention for his leadership and policies, particularly among Republicans and independents, his national profile is not as prominent as some other potential candidates. However, being a relatively fresh face with executive experience could work in his favor, especially if voters are looking for a candidate who is perceived as being outside the Washington establishment. 2. Competitive Landscape: The field for the Republican nomination is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates potentially running, including former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and several current and former governors and senators. Suarez would need to differentiate himself significantly and build a substantial campaign apparatus to compete effectively against these more established figures. 3. Historical Trends: Historically, the Republican Party has often nominated candidates who have previously held high-level federal offices or have run in a previous presidential primary. While there are exceptions, Suarez's background as a mayor, without federal experience, might be seen as unconventional for a presidential nominee. However, the political landscape is continually evolving, and there is a growing trend towards considering non-traditional candidates. 4. Fundraising and Endorsements: Suarez's ability to raise funds and secure endorsements from key Republican figures and organizations will be crucial. Without significant financial backing and support from party leaders, it would be challenging for him to mount a successful campaign.

Given that the market was created on May 26, 2023, and resolves on July 15, 2024, there is roughly one year for the market to attract the additional traders needed. The growth rate of traders in such markets can be highly variable, influenced by factors such as market visibility, the relevance of the topic, and community engagement. Without specific data on the growth trend of this market, we must make a general assessment based on typical patterns. Many prediction markets experience slow growth initially, followed by a period of more rapid expansion as they gain visibility and attract more participants. However, reaching a specific number of traders (in this case, 377) within a tight time frame (by the end of July 15) can be challenging, especially if the market's topic is niche or does not generate significant interest among potential traders. Given the roughly one-year timeframe and the need for 78 more traders, the task seems achievable but still carries uncertainty.

Recent Participation: Luxembourg returned to the contest in 2024 after a long absence, which might impact their performance due to lack of recent experience.

Without knowing the specifics of Luxembourg's entry for 2024, it's challenging to assess how well they will do. However, the choice of artist and song can significantly influence voting outcomes. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical, cultural, and political factors. Luxembourg, being a Western European country, might benefit from voting patterns that tend to favor Western European nations. However, these patterns can vary, and the introduction of a mixed voting system (jury and public vote) has aimed to make the contest more unpredictable. 5. Competition: The overall quality and appeal of entries from other countries will also play a significant role. In a year with many strong entries, the competition for a spot in the Grand Final increases. Given these factors and without specific information about Luxembourg's entry for 2024, we must rely on general trends and the inherent unpredictability of the Eurovision Song Contest. Luxembourg's return after a long absence could bring a fresh and potentially competitive entry, but the lack of recent experience and the unknown quality of their entry make it challenging to predict a qualification with high certainty. Considering the mixed bag of historical performance, the unpredictability of voting, and the lack of information on their 2024 entry, a cautious approach is to assign a probability that reflects a moderate chance of qualification, acknowledging both the potential for a strong return and the challenges inherent in the contest."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "a5146eab-3832-44e6-871e-b32a720a1182", "title": "Will either Ireland or Luxembourg qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either of the following occurs: (a) Ireland participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, or (b) Luxembourg participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Taylor Swift's Acting Career: Taylor Swift is a renowned musician but has also made appearances in film and television. Her most notable roles include appearances in 'Valentine's Day' (2010), 'The Lorax' (2012), 'One Chance' (2013), and 'Cats' (2019). This shows she is open to acting roles, albeit usually in smaller or voice-over capacities. 2. The Movie 'Deadpool and Wolverine': This upcoming film is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and combines two of the most popular characters from the X-Men comics. Given the nature of both Deadpool and Wolverine, the movie is expected to be a mix of action, comedy, and possibly some musical elements, considering Deadpool's breaking of the fourth wall and the inclusion of comedic relief. 3. The Role of Dazzler: Dazzler is a character from the X-Men comics known for her ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams. Given Taylor Swift's background as a musician, there was speculation and fan-casting about her potentially playing Dazzler in an X-Men or related movie. The article from People magazine suggests there was at least some consideration or fan discussion about this possibility. 4. Cameos in MCU Movies: The MCU is known for including cameos in their films, often featuring well-known actors or celebrities in small, sometimes uncredited roles. Given the nature of 'Deadpool and Wolverine' and the tendency for unexpected cameos, especially in Deadpool movies, it's plausible that Taylor Swift could appear in a small or voice-over role. Considering these points, while there's no concrete evidence confirming Taylor Swift's appearance in 'Deadpool and Wolverine' as of the last update, the nature of the film, combined with the MCU's history of cameos and Taylor Swift's openness to acting roles, makes it a plausible possibility. However, without direct confirmation, the likelihood remains speculative."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "daea5486-34b3-499b-b1cc-292cab51a7e6", "title": "Will Deadpool & Wolverine have biggest opening weekend ever for R-rated movie?

Current Standing in Polls: As of my last update, Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and author, has announced his candidacy but is not among the top contenders in most national polls regarding the Republican primary. The front-runners have typically included figures like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, though the landscape can change. 2. Political Experience: Ramaswamy lacks significant political experience compared to other potential nominees. This could be a disadvantage in securing the nomination, as party delegates might prefer a candidate with a proven track record in politics. 3. Competitive Landscape: The Republican primary field is expected to be crowded, with several candidates vying for the nomination. This fragmentation could potentially benefit a dark horse candidate, but it generally favors those with higher name recognition and political capital. 4. Republican National Convention Dynamics: The nomination process at the convention can be unpredictable, with delegates sometimes changing their allegiances. However, this unpredictability is more likely to benefit candidates with significant political backing or those who have managed to build a substantial coalition within the party. Considering these factors, while Vivek Ramaswamy has a unique appeal that could attract a segment of Republican voters, his lack of political experience and the competitive nature of the primary make it challenging for him to secure the nomination.

As of the question's creation date (April 25, 2024), the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map does not show Chasiv Yar under Russian control. However, the situation on the ground can change rapidly due to ongoing military operations. Several factors could influence the outcome: 1. Ongoing Conflict Dynamics: The conflict in Ukraine is highly dynamic, with both sides engaging in military operations that could lead to changes in territorial control. Ukrainian forces might launch counteroffensives or partisan warfare, potentially pushing Russian forces back or disrupting their control over certain areas. 2. Russian Military Strategy: Russia's military strategy and priorities could shift, potentially leading to a focus on securing or retaking specific locations, including Chasiv Yar. This could involve increased military presence or operations in the area. 3. International Support and Sanctions: The level of international support for Ukraine, including military aid and economic sanctions against Russia, could impact the balance of power on the ground. Increased support for Ukraine might help Ukrainian forces to resist or counter Russian advances more effectively. 4. Geopolitical Developments: Diplomatic efforts or changes in the international political landscape could lead to pressure on Russia to withdraw from certain areas or to negotiate a ceasefire, potentially affecting control over Chasiv Yar. Given these factors and the inherent unpredictability of military conflicts, it's challenging to assign a precise probability. However, considering the current situation and the potential for ongoing conflict dynamics, a moderate probability seems reasonable.

Eastern Conference Competition: The Eastern Conference is filled with strong contenders, including the Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics, and Philadelphia 76ers, among others. These teams have consistently shown high levels of performance and have rosters that are arguably more talented and cohesive than the Knicks. 4. Injury and Team Chemistry Factors: The NBA season is long, and injuries can significantly impact a team's chances. Additionally, team chemistry and coaching play crucial roles in a team's success. While the Knicks have shown improvement in these areas, predicting how these factors will influence their season is challenging. 5. Offseason Moves and Trades: The NBA offseason can drastically change a team's fortunes. Significant trades or free agent signings can elevate a team from a playoff contender to a championship favorite.

The quality and appeal of the song Poland selects for the contest are crucial factors. A catchy, well-performed song that resonates with a broad audience can significantly improve a country's chances of qualifying for the Grand Final.

Lastly, any changes to the contest format, voting system, or rules could potentially affect Poland's chances. For instance, changes in how jury and public votes are weighted or the introduction of new voting mechanisms could impact the outcome.

Current Position and Experience: Kamala Harris is currently the Vice President of the United States under President Joe Biden. She has been in this role since January 2021 and has gained significant national and international experience. This existing role could give her a strong advantage in being renominated. 2. Relationship with President Biden: Harris and Biden's working relationship appears to be strong.

The stability and continuity of having the same running mate for a potential second term could be seen as beneficial. 3. Popularity within the Party: Harris is well-regarded within the Democratic Party. She has been a vocal advocate for progressive policies and has used her platform to address issues such as voting rights, immigration reform, and women's rights. However, like any political figure, she has her detractors, but her overall standing within the party seems solid. 4. Potential Alternatives: The pool of potential alternatives to Harris is deep, including other high-profile Democrats who might bring different strengths or appeal to different segments of the electorate. However, changing running mates can sometimes be perceived as a sign of weakness or dissatisfaction, which might make it less likely unless there's a compelling reason to do so. 5. Health and Personal Factors: Both Biden and Harris's health and personal factors appear stable, with no publicly known issues that would impact their ability to run again.

Competition Format: Swimming competitions at the Olympics are structured in a way that allows top athletes to participate in multiple events. This is unlike some other sports where athletes might specialize in a single event. The ability to compete in multiple events increases a swimmer's chances of accumulating more medals. 3. Current Talent Pool: As of my last update, there are several talented swimmers who could potentially win multiple gold medals. The likes of Katie Ledecky (USA), Caeleb Dressel (USA), and other emerging talents are expected to dominate in their respective events. However, the landscape of sports talent can shift rapidly due to new athletes emerging, training advancements, and other factors. 4.

For Nvidia to surpass Apple's market cap, Nvidia would need to experience significant growth, while Apple would need to see a substantial decline in its market value. Nvidia has been growing rapidly in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) in gaming, artificial intelligence, and other applications.

Historical Context: It's essential to look at past Olympic Games to understand the trend of countries winning their first-ever Olympic gold medal or their first-ever Olympic medal. Historically, each Olympic Games has seen a number of countries achieving this milestone, reflecting the increasing global participation in the Olympics and the improving standards of athletes from a wider range of countries. 2. Increasing Global Participation: The participation in the Olympics has been expanding over the years, with more countries and athletes taking part. This expansion increases the likelihood of countries winning their first Olympic medals, including gold medals. 3. New Sports and Events: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been adding new sports and events to the Olympic program, which opens up opportunities for countries that may not have traditional strengths in the existing Olympic sports. This diversification can lead to a higher number of countries winning their first medals. 4. Paris 2024 Specifics: For the 2024 Paris Olympics, there are several new sports and events added to the program, such as surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing, and breakdancing. These additions could favor countries that have a strong culture or talent pool in these areas but may not have been as competitive in traditional Olympic sports. 5. Global Development of Sports: The development of sports infrastructure, training methods, and talent identification programs around the world has been improving. This global development increases the chances of athletes from a broader range of countries achieving the level of excellence required to win Olympic medals. Considering these factors, it's reasonable to anticipate that the trend of countries winning their first Olympic medals, including gold medals, will continue. Given the addition of new sports, the increasing global participation, and the ongoing development of sports capabilities worldwide, it seems likely that at least 5 countries will achieve this milestone at the 2024 Paris Olympics."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Past Performance and Reputation: Chris Christie served as the Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018 and ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. His campaign was notable for his outspoken style, but he ultimately dropped out early in the primary process. Christie's reputation has been mixed, with both praise for his directness and criticism for his handling of certain policies and controversies, such as the Bridgegate scandal. 2. Current Political Climate: The Republican Party has significantly shifted since Christie's last presidential bid, with a greater emphasis on Trumpism and conservative values. Christie's more moderate stance on certain issues might make it challenging for him to gain traction with the party's base, which has become increasingly conservative. 3. Field of Candidates: The potential field for the 2024 Republican nomination is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates, including former President Donald Trump, who maintains a strong base within the party. Other potential candidates might include more conservative figures, moderates, and newcomers, making it a competitive landscape for Christie. 4. Delegate Selection Process: The question specifies that the outcome is determined by who is selected by the delegates of the Republican National Convention. This process can be unpredictable and influenced by factors such as party politics, candidate momentum, and strategic maneuvering. Considering these factors, while Chris Christie has political experience and a certain level of recognition, his path to the nomination appears challenging due to the current political climate within the Republican Party and the expected field of candidates.

Current Landscape and Candidates: As of my last update, the Republican field for the 2024 presidential election is wide open. While there are several potential candidates, including Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others, Glenn Youngkin and Chris Christie are among those who have shown interest or have been mentioned as possible contenders. However, neither Youngkin nor Christie has gained significant traction or widespread national support compared to some of the other potential candidates. 2. Popularity and Support: Glenn Youngkin, the Governor of Virginia, has gained some attention for his 2021 gubernatorial win in a state that has trended Democratic in recent years. However, his national profile and appeal to a broad Republican base are still relatively limited compared to other figures like Trump or DeSantis. Chris Christie, a former Governor of New Jersey and a 2016 presidential candidate, has maintained a national profile but faces significant challenges in gaining broad support within the party due to his past criticisms of Trump and some of his policy positions. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party is currently deeply influenced by former President Donald Trump and his supporters. Candidates who have been critical of Trump or are seen as not sufficiently aligned with his policies face significant challenges in gaining the nomination. Both Youngkin and Christie would need to navigate these dynamics carefully. Considering these factors, while it's possible for either Glenn Youngkin or Chris Christie to emerge as the Republican nominee, especially in a field that could become highly fragmented, the current indications suggest that they face significant hurdles. Their path to the nomination would require building substantial support and navigating the complex internal dynamics of the Republican Party."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.01581653468331276, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00527217822777092, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17789201674120503, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

In contrast, the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) held around 24% and 20% of the seats, respectively. While there has been a rise in left-wing and populist movements in some European countries, it is unlikely that GUE/NGL will surpass the EPP and S&D to become the largest group in the European Parliament. Firstly, the GUE/NGL's current seat share is relatively low, and it would require a significant surge in support to overtake the larger groups. Secondly, the European Parliament elections tend to favor established parties and groups, making it harder for smaller groups like GUE/NGL to make substantial gains. Furthermore, the European Parliament's electoral system, which is based on proportional representation, tends to favor coalitions and alliances rather than single groups.

However, based on their past performance and the general trends in the contest, it's reasonable to assume that they have a good chance of qualifying. One factor that could work in Azerbaijan's favor is the diversity of their entries. Azerbaijan has a history of sending a wide range of songs and artists to the contest, from traditional folk-pop to more modern and experimental sounds. This diversity could help them appeal to a broad range of voters and increase their chances of qualifying.

Historically, debates among candidates of the same party are common before the party's national convention. These debates serve as a platform for candidates to present their policies, engage with their opponents, and increase their visibility among voters. Given that the Democratic Party has traditionally held multiple debates in the run-up to its national convention, it's reasonable to expect this pattern to continue. The presence of notable candidates such as Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, and Biden (assuming he seeks re-election) would typically necessitate debates. These events allow candidates to differentiate themselves, which is crucial in a competitive primary environment. The Democratic Party, like its Republican counterpart, has an interest in showcasing its candidates and policies to the American public. Debates are an effective way to do this, as they attract significant media attention and public interest. Given the resolution date of August 12, 2024, and considering the Democratic National Convention is usually held in the summer, there is ample time for the organization and execution of at least one debate before the convention. The political climate is always a factor in election cycles. Given the polarization and the high stakes of the 2024 election, debates would serve as critical moments for candidates to address key issues and attempt to sway undecided voters. Considering these points, it's logical to conclude that there will indeed be another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

Trump's direct involvement in the case makes his testimony potentially relevant. 2. Trump's Role: As the central figure in the allegations, Trump's testimony could be crucial for both the prosecution and the defense. However, as a former President, Trump might use his status and legal team to resist testifying. 3. Past Behavior: Trump has a history of avoiding direct testimony in legal cases, often preferring written statements or using his lawyers to communicate his stance. This pattern suggests he might resist testifying in this case as well. 4. Legal Strategies: The prosecution might subpoena Trump to testify, but his legal team could fight such a subpoena, potentially delaying or preventing his testimony. The defense strategy might also evolve based on how the trial progresses, influencing the decision on whether Trump testifies. 5. Public and Political Pressure: The decision for Trump to testify could also be influenced by public opinion and political considerations, especially given his ongoing political activities and potential future campaigns.

The question resolves YES if either of these conditions is met.\n\nScenario 1: Trump Gaining at Least 3% More Votes Against Biden Than a Generic Democrat\n\nThis scenario depends on the outcomes of two Manifold polls closing on July 6, one featuring Joe Biden and the other a generic Democrat. The calculation to determine if Trump gains at least 3% more votes is based on the formula: (Trump / (Trump + (the Democrat in the question) + Someone else)).\n\nReasoning for Scenario 1:\n\n- Historical Context: Trump's performance against named opponents versus generic Democrats can vary significantly. Named opponents can bring their own set of baggage and voter perceptions, which can affect polling outcomes.\n- Polling Variability: Polls, especially those conducted online or through specific platforms like Manifold, can have biases and may not perfectly reflect the broader electorate. However, for the purpose of this question, we're focused on the internal dynamics within Manifold's respondent pool.\n- Biden's Popularity: As of the last update, Joe Biden's popularity has been relatively stable but can fluctuate. A generic Democrat might not carry the same level of recognition or polarizing factors as Biden.\n\nGiven these considerations, predicting a 3% gain specifically might be challenging without more current polling data or trends. However, it's plausible that facing a named opponent like Biden could consolidate more support behind Trump among certain groups within the Manifold respondents, potentially leading to a slight increase in his polling numbers compared to facing a generic Democrat.\n\nScenario 2: Trump Testifying at the Hush Money Trial\n\nReasoning for Scenario 2:\n\n- Legal Strategy: Whether Trump testifies is largely dependent on his legal team's strategy and whether they believe his testimony could benefit or harm his case.\n- Public Perception: Trump's decision might also consider public perception and how his base might react to him testifying or not.\n- Precedent: It's relatively rare for defendants in such cases to testify, especially in high-profile trials where the defendant is a public figure.\n\nGiven these factors, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether Trump will testify. However, considering the rarity of defendants testifying in their own trials, especially in high-profile cases, this scenario might be less likely.\n\nCombined Probability\n\nGiven the complexity and uncertainty in both scenarios, assigning a precise probability is challenging. However, considering the factors above:\n\n- Scenario 1 has a degree of plausibility due to the dynamics of named opponents versus generic ones in polling.\n- Scenario 2, while less likely due to the nature of high-profile trials, cannot be ruled out entirely due to the unpredictable nature of Trump's actions.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios, the probability that either Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden or he testifies at the hush money trial is somewhat above a coin toss but not overwhelmingly likely."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.00042043631344379495, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00014014543781459832, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.028970298940987363, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Unfortunately, the prompt does not provide information on the current number of traders or the historical growth rate of the market. However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that the market needs 78 more traders to reach the target. Assuming that the market has been growing steadily since its creation on July 4, we can estimate the average daily growth rate. Let's assume that the market had 0 traders on July 4 and has been growing linearly since then. To reach 299 traders (377 - 78) in 11 days (July 4 to July 15), the market would need to grow at an average rate of approximately 27 traders per day. To reach the target of 377 traders, the market would need to maintain this growth rate for the remaining 11 days. However, it's likely that the growth rate will slow down as the market approaches its target. Additionally, the market's growth may be affected by various factors such as changes in market conditions, competition, or external events. Given the uncertainty surrounding the market's growth rate and the limited information provided, I would estimate the probability of the market reaching at least 377 traders by the end of July 15 as follows: Probability: 0.4.

He ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, where he was the second-to-last candidate standing, ultimately losing to Donald Trump. This experience could be beneficial in another presidential nomination bid. 2. Current Political Climate: The political landscape is highly polarized, and the popularity of candidates can fluctuate rapidly. Cruz maintains a strong base of support, particularly among conservative Republicans. However, his appeal to a broader audience and ability to navigate the complex political environment will be crucial. 3. Potential Competitors: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could be crowded, with potential candidates including former President Donald Trump, other senators, governors, and political figures. The competition will be fierce, and Cruz's ability to stand out and garner widespread support will be tested. 4. Nomination Process: The Republican National Convention's delegate selection process is key to winning the nomination. Candidates must perform well in primaries and caucuses across the country to accumulate delegates. Cruz's strategic approach to targeting specific states and his ability to connect with voters in those states will be critical.

Markets like the BSE SENSEX can be volatile, and their day-to-day movements can be influenced by a wide range of factors including economic indicators, political events, and global market trends. Given the specific nature of the question, which asks for a precise range (greater than 75k and less than or equal to 76k), it implies a relatively narrow margin for the index's closing value. Historically, the SENSEX has shown the ability to move significantly in either direction, but predicting such a specific range requires detailed technical analysis and access to current market conditions, which I do not have. However, considering the general volatility of stock markets and the relatively narrow range specified in the question, I would consider this a challenging prediction to make accurately without current data. Given these constraints, my approach is to consider the vast number of possible outcomes for the SENSEX's closing value on any given day and the inherent unpredictability of market movements. While it's entirely plausible for the SENSEX to close within the specified range, predicting this outcome with high confidence is difficult without specific data indicating a trend towards stabilization within that range.

Historical Performance: Georgia has participated in Eurovision since 2007 but has had mixed results. They have qualified for the Grand Final on several occasions, most recently in 2016. Understanding their past performances can give us insight into their potential for qualification. 2. Song and Artist Quality: The quality of the song and the performing artist plays a significant role in a country's success at Eurovision. Without knowing who will represent Georgia in 2024 and what their song will be, it's challenging to assess their chances accurately. However, if Georgia selects a strong and catchy song with broad appeal, performed by a talented and charismatic artist, their chances of qualifying would increase. 3. Competition: The level of competition in the Semi-finals is another crucial factor. The lineup for Eurovision 2024, including which countries will participate in the same Semi-final as Georgia, will significantly impact their qualification chances. A Semi-final with several traditionally strong Eurovision countries could make qualification more difficult. 4. Voting Patterns: Voting patterns, including both jury and public votes, can influence the outcome. Countries with large diasporas or those that tend to receive high scores from certain other countries may have an advantage. Georgia might benefit from votes from neighboring or culturally aligned countries. 5. Performance and Staging: The live performance, including staging, choreography, and overall visual impact, can greatly affect how well a song is received by both the audience and the juries. A memorable and visually appealing performance can elevate a song's chances. Given these factors and without specific information about Georgia's entry for Eurovision 2024, it's difficult to provide a precise probability.

However, their recent performances have been less consistent, with their last qualification for the Grand Final being in 2015.

Both countries have shown the ability to produce competitive entries, but the competition in Eurovision is fierce, with many countries investing heavily in their entries. The semi-finals are divided into two groups, with the top 10 countries from each semi-final qualifying for the Grand Final. This means that both Georgia and Estonia need to outperform a significant portion of the other participating countries in their respective semi-finals to qualify. Given these considerations, while it's possible for either or both countries to qualify, the competition is intense, and their recent track records have been inconsistent.

The Nature of News Reporting: Major news outlets like the Associated Press, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Reuters, and Washington Post have extensive networks of journalists and sources within the government and political circles. These networks are designed to uncover and report significant political developments before they become official. 2. Advance Notice and Leaks: In the world of politics, especially concerning high-profile decisions such as a president dropping out of an election, leaks and rumors often circulate before an official announcement. Given the significance of a sitting president deciding not to run for re-election, it's likely that there would be some level of internal discussion or preparation that could be leaked or otherwise uncovered by diligent reporting. 3. Media's Role and Incentives: The first news outlet to break a story of this magnitude gains significant prestige, credibility, and viewership. This creates a strong incentive for news organizations to invest in investigative journalism and to cultivate sources that can provide early warnings of such developments. 4. Definition of \"Unofficial Confirmation\": The question specifies that an \"unofficial confirmation\" is required. This could mean a report from a trusted source within the Biden administration or campaign that is not an official spokesperson but is credible enough for a major news outlet to stake its reputation on the story. 5. Consideration of False Positives: While there's a chance of false positives (stories that suggest Biden will drop out when he doesn't), the specified news outlets are generally considered reliable and have processes in place to verify information before publication. This reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of false positives. 6. Timeframe and the Election Cycle: The resolution date is set before the end of the National Democratic Convention, which is a critical juncture for candidate nominations. If Biden were to drop out, it would likely be before this point to allow the party to nominate another candidate. This timeframe increases the likelihood of media scrutiny and, consequently, the chance of a leak or early report. Considering these factors, it seems probable that if Joe Biden were to drop out, a reliable media outlet would have the resources, incentives, and possibly the information to cover the story at least 6 hours in advance of an official announcement."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "336bd6ef-bd57-4288-bbdc-3ccf100739cd", "title": "Will Donald Trump Jr. be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump Jr. is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Firstly, Malta has a mixed history in Eurovision. While they have qualified for the Grand Final several times, their participation has also seen them not qualifying on multiple occasions. Their most recent performances have been inconsistent, which makes predicting their success challenging. Secondly, the competition format of Eurovision involves two semi-finals, from which a certain number of countries qualify for the Grand Final. The qualification is based on a combination of jury and public voting. This format means that the competition is not only about the quality of the song but also about the appeal it has to both the professional juries and the public across Europe and beyond. Lastly, factors such as the song choice, artist popularity, staging, and the running order in the semi-final can significantly impact a country's chances of qualifying. Since the details about Malta's entry for Eurovision 2024 are not provided, it's difficult to assess their potential appeal and quality compared to other competing entries. Given these considerations and without specific information about Malta's entry for 2024, we can only look at their general past performance and the unpredictable nature of the competition.

Franchise Popularity: Both Deadpool and Wolverine are extremely popular characters within the X-Men franchise, which has a large and dedicated fan base. The success of previous films, especially 'Deadpool,' indicates a strong interest in these characters. Combining them in one movie could potentially attract an even larger audience, including fans of both characters who might not have been as interested in solo films. 2. Marketing and Hype: The marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will likely capitalize on the popularity of both characters, potentially generating significant hype. The success of 'Deadpool' was partly due to its innovative marketing strategy, which could be replicated or even surpassed with the addition of Wolverine. 3. Cinematic Universe Expansion: The movie might also serve as a vehicle to expand the cinematic universe these characters inhabit. If the film hints at a larger universe or introduces elements that will be explored in future movies, it could attract viewers interested in the broader narrative beyond just the characters of Deadpool and Wolverine. 4. Competition and Release Date: The release date of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' and the competitive landscape at the time of its release will significantly impact its box office performance. A release date during a less crowded period or one that strategically avoids direct competition with other blockbuster films could contribute to a higher opening weekend. 5. Critical Reception and Word-of-Mouth: Positive reviews and strong word-of-mouth were crucial for the success of 'Deadpool.' If 'Deadpool & Wolverine' receives similar acclaim, it could lead to a strong opening weekend as fans and critics alike rush to see the film. 6. Inflation and Box Office Trends: The box office performance of movies has generally increased over time due to inflation and the growing popularity of cinema. Since 'The Wolverine' was released in 2013 and 'Deadpool' in 2016, the natural increase in box office numbers over time could alone contribute to 'Deadpool & Wolverine' having a higher opening weekend than the sum of the two previous films. Considering these factors, it seems likely that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will have a strong opening weekend. The combination of two highly popular characters, the potential for a robust marketing campaign, the expansion of the cinematic universe, and the general increase in box office numbers over time all suggest that the film could outperform the combined openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine.'"}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "3f77dd86-bf90-4d04-934c-4c8a7fa8cce2", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Taylor Swift cameos in Deadpool and Wolverine, or (b) the domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" exceeds $185,548,391?", "body": "(a) Taylor Swift cameos in Deadpool and Wolverine.

Current Polling Average: As of the question's creation on July 9, 2024, Trump's lead over Biden is 2.4 points. This value falls within the specified range, indicating a positive start. 2. Polling Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological adjustments by pollsters. However, significant shifts within a short period (in this case, six days from July 9 to July 15) are relatively uncommon, especially in averages that smooth out individual poll variations. 3. Trend Stability: The closer we get to the election, the more stable polling trends tend to become, as more voters solidify their choices. However, July 2024 is still several months before the election, a period where public opinion can be influenced by campaign events, debates, and external factors. 4. Margin of Error and Statistical Noise: Polling averages have margins of error, and individual polls can introduce statistical noise. However, 538's model incorporates multiple polls and adjusts for these factors, providing a more stable estimate. Considering these factors, the current lead of 2.4 points as of July 9 is a positive indicator. However, the inherent volatility and statistical noise in polling data mean there's always a chance the numbers could shift outside the specified range. Given the short time frame and the stability generally observed in polling averages, significant shifts are less likely but not impossible. Given the current information and understanding of polling dynamics, the probability that Trump's lead over Biden will be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, seems relatively high but not certain due to the inherent uncertainties in polling data."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "235a2281-ed59-4d24-9416-43bddd1b3068", "title": "Will the  CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS)\t\n be higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve based on reporting by the St. Louis Fed here: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VXVCLS.

This section allows the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or another relevant body) to declare the President unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, making the Vice President the Acting President. Several factors suggest that this event is unlikely: 1. Historical Precedent: The 25th Amendment has been invoked a few times since its ratification in 1967, but these instances were primarily for temporary transfers of power due to medical procedures or the President's brief incapacitation. The use of Section 4 to permanently declare a President incapacitated is unprecedented and would be a significant political and constitutional step. 2. Political Considerations: Invoking Section 4 would be a highly politicized move, likely to face significant opposition and legal challenges. The political climate would need to be extremely conducive to such an action, with broad bipartisan support or overwhelming evidence of the President's inability to serve. 3. Procedural Hurdles: The process requires the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to agree. Alternatively, if the Cabinet does not agree, a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate is needed to declare the President incapacitated. This is a high bar to clear, especially in a closely divided Congress. 4. Public Perception and Support: The President enjoys a certain level of public support and goodwill. Declaring him incapacitated without clear and compelling evidence of his inability to serve would likely be met with skepticism and resistance from a significant portion of the public. 5. Context of the Question: The mention of a GOP lawmaker asking Merrick Garland to invoke the 25th Amendment suggests a partisan initiative, which might not garner the broad support needed for such a measure.

However, in 2021, they achieved a respectable 3rd place with Gjon's Tears and the song 'Tout l'univers.' This suggests that Switzerland is capable of fielding competitive entries. 2. Qualification System: The qualification for the Grand Final is determined by a combination of jury and public voting in the Semi-finals. The top 10 countries from each Semi-final qualify for the Grand Final. This system emphasizes both the quality of the performance as perceived by professional juries and the appeal to the broader audience. 3. Song and Artist Selection Process: Switzerland has been using an internal selection process to choose their Eurovision entries. This process involves a professional jury selecting the artist and song without a public vote. While this method can sometimes lead to less predictable outcomes, it also means that the selection is based on a strategic assessment of what might do well in the contest. 4. Competition: The level of competition in Eurovision is high and varies significantly from year to year. Factors such as the quality of the songs, the performance of the artists, and the voting patterns (including political and cultural biases) can all impact a country's chances of qualifying. 5. Recent Trends: In recent years, Switzerland has shown an improvement in their approach to Eurovision, with more contemporary and competitive entries. If this trend continues, it could enhance their chances of qualifying. Given these factors, while it's challenging to predict with certainty due to the subjective nature of the contest and the variables involved, Switzerland has demonstrated the potential to field strong entries.

His popularity among a substantial segment of Republican voters could make him a strong candidate for the 2024 nomination. Additionally, his family members, particularly those involved in politics like Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, might benefit from his endorsement and popularity. 2. **Primary Elections and Republican Party Dynamics**: The Republican Party's nomination process involves primary elections and caucuses across the states. This process can be highly competitive, and the outcome is influenced by various factors, including the candidates' campaign strategies, fundraising capabilities, and their appeal to a broad base of Republican voters. 3. **Potential Candidates**: Besides the Trump family, there are other prominent Republicans who might run for the presidency in 2024. These could include current or former governors, senators, and other political figures with strong track records and support within the party. The competition among these candidates, including any from the Trump family, would play a crucial role in determining the nominee. 4. **Public Opinion and Polls**: Public opinion, as reflected in polls, can provide insights into the potential candidates' popularity and chances of winning the nomination. However, it's essential to consider that public opinion can shift significantly over time, influenced by events, campaigns, and the candidates' performances in debates and primaries. 5. **Legal and Health Factors**: The eligibility and health of potential candidates, including those from the Trump family, could impact their ability to run and win the nomination. Any legal issues or health concerns might deter or disqualify a candidate from the race. Given these considerations, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024.

His influence over the party and his ability to raise funds are considerable advantages. 2. **Potential Challengers**: The field of potential challengers within the Republican Party includes other notable figures, some of whom have already announced their candidacy or are rumored to be considering a run. The strength of these challengers, their ability to fundraise, and their appeal to a broad spectrum of Republican voters will play a significant role in determining Trump's chances. 3. **Political Climate**: The political climate leading up to the 2024 election is expected to be highly polarized, with both major parties facing internal divisions. The Republican Party's stance on various issues, including the economy, immigration, and healthcare, and how these stances align with or diverge from Trump's positions, could impact his nomination prospects. 4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Trump faces several legal challenges that could potentially impact his candidacy, though it's uncertain how these will resolve or if they will significantly affect his standing within the party. 5. **Historical Context**: Historically, it's rare for a major party to nominate the same individual for president three times consecutively, especially after losing the previous election.

However, he has also shown a willingness to engage with the legal system in cases where he feels strongly about the outcome or perceives a political advantage. 3. Potential Legal and Political Ramifications: Testifying could expose Trump to further legal scrutiny and potential perjury charges if his testimony is later found to be false. However, not testifying could also have political implications, especially if it's perceived as an admission of guilt or an attempt to hide something. 4. Public Statements and Intentions: As of my last update, there hasn't been a clear indication from Trump or his legal team that he intends to testify. However, this could change based on the trial's progression and strategic decisions made by his legal team. 5. Legal Maneuvering and Negotiations: Often, in such high-profile cases, negotiations and legal maneuvering occur behind the scenes. These could influence whether Trump ends up testifying, possibly as part of a deal or to avoid further legal complications.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update, Tucker Carlson is a prominent figure in American conservative media, hosting a highly-rated show on Fox News. However, being a media personality and a political candidate are vastly different roles. While his media presence could be an advantage in terms of name recognition and fundraising, it also means he has a history of public statements that could be scrutinized or used against him in a political campaign. 2. Political Experience: Carlson has no direct experience in elected office, which is often (though not always) a significant factor in successful presidential candidacies. His lack of a political track record could make it difficult for him to navigate the complexities of a national campaign and to appeal to voters who prioritize governance experience. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has a broad base with diverse interests and factions. Carlson's appeal to certain segments of the party (e.g., the more conservative or populist wings) is clear, but his ability to unite the party as a whole is less certain. His controversial stances on some issues could alienate moderate Republicans or those who prefer a candidate with a proven electoral track record. 4. Competition: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination is likely to be crowded, with several candidates who have more traditional political backgrounds and possibly broader appeal within the party and beyond. The competition for funds, media attention, and voter support will be intense, and Carlson would need to outmaneuver experienced politicians to secure the nomination. 5. Historical Precedents: While not unheard of, it is relatively rare for individuals without prior elected office to secure a major party's presidential nomination. When it has happened (e.g., with Donald Trump in 2016), it often involves a unique combination of factors, including celebrity status, significant personal wealth, and a political environment conducive to outsider candidates. Given these considerations, while it's impossible to rule out Tucker Carlson's candidacy entirely, the factors stacked against him (lack of political experience, the competitive nature of the Republican primary, and the rarity of non-politicians winning major party nominations) suggest that his chances are relatively low compared to more traditional candidates."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6cbcd95f-12a4-4ffb-a927-97bf4124a8c8", "title": "Will Francis Suarez be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Francis Suarez is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Current Polling Average: As of the question's creation on July 8, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points, which falls within the specified range. However, polling averages can fluctuate over time due to various factors such as new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological adjustments by 538. 2. Volatility in Polling Averages: Polling averages can be volatile, especially in the context of a presidential election where public opinion can shift rapidly in response to news events, campaign strategies, and external factors. However, the range specified (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) is relatively narrow, suggesting that significant volatility would be required to move the average outside this range. 3. Time Frame: The question pertains to a specific date, July 15, 2024, which is about a week from the question's creation. Over such a short period, significant shifts in public opinion are less likely, but not impossible, especially in the fast-paced environment of a presidential election. 4. Methodological Stability: 538's polling average methodology is designed to smooth out some of the volatility by incorporating multiple polls over time and adjusting for factors like pollster bias and sample size. This methodological stability tends to reduce the likelihood of sudden, large shifts in the polling average. Considering these factors, the current lead of 2.4 points is already within the specified range, and given the short time frame and the methodological stability of 538's polling average, significant changes are less likely but not impossible. Therefore, the probability that Trump's lead remains within this narrow range is relatively high but not a certainty due to the inherent volatility of election polling."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "ae838b50-ebcc-489a-bc63-76d3c9c07d05", "title": "Will Joe Biden have an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes, before the end of July 2024?", "body": "The most recent qualifying interview was Biden's appearance on The Howard Stern Show in April, when Biden answered questions for ~70 minutes. \n\nIf Biden appears in another such in-person interview for at least 45 minutes, this market resolves YES.

(a) For Trump's lead over Biden to be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, several factors come into play. These include the current polling numbers, trends in public opinion, and any significant events that could influence these numbers between now and July 15. Given the fluid nature of election polling and the relatively narrow margin specified, predicting this outcome involves considerable uncertainty. However, if we observe current trends and assume no major events drastically alter public opinion, we might estimate a probability for this event. Without specific current polling data in the prompt, let's conservatively estimate this probability as relatively low, given the specificity of the margin and the inherent volatility of election polls. (b) For Joe Biden to have an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024, we consider his past behavior and the context of his recent interviews. Given that he has participated in such interviews in the past (e.g., The Howard Stern Show in April), it's plausible he could do so again, especially considering the strategic importance of media appearances during an election year. However, the requirement for at least 45 minutes of new footage in a single appearance is somewhat specific and narrows the range of qualifying events. Still, given the strategic value of such appearances for election campaigns, this event seems more likely than not, assuming the campaign seeks to maximize visibility and engagement. Combining these considerations, we have two events with different likelihoods. Event (a) is less likely due to its specificity and the inherent unpredictability of polling averages. Event (b) is more plausible, given past behavior and campaign strategies. To combine these into a single probability estimate for either event occurring, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but given the distinct nature of these events, we'll simplify by assuming their independence and that the occurrence of one does not significantly impact the likelihood of the other. Let's assign a rough estimate for event (a) as 0.2, reflecting its lower likelihood due to specificity and polling volatility. For event (b), a more moderate estimate could be 0.6, considering past behavior and campaign strategy but also the specific requirements for a qualifying interview. The probability of either event happening is 1 minus the probability of neither happening. Assuming independence: P(Either) = 1 - P(Neither) = 1 - (1 - P(a))(1 - P(b)) P(Either) = 1 - (1 - 0.2)(1 - 0.6) = 1 - (0.8)(0.4) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

While several names have been floated, including former President Donald Trump and several other prominent Republicans, the field has not yet solidified. This openness means there is still significant room for candidates to enter and make a substantial impact. 2. Tim Scott's Profile: Tim Scott, a U.S. Senator from South Carolina, has been mentioned as a potential candidate. He has built a reputation as a conservative with the ability to connect with a broad audience. Scott's personal story, policy positions, and ability to potentially bridge some of the divides within the Republican Party could make him an attractive candidate to some voters. 3. Primary Election Dynamics: The Republican primary process is complex, involving multiple states with different voter demographics and preferences. Success in the primaries often requires a combination of appealing to the base, having strong fundraising capabilities, and building a robust campaign infrastructure. Scott's ability to perform well across these dimensions will be crucial. 4. Competition: The potential for Donald Trump to run again could significantly impact the race. Trump has a strong base within the Republican Party, and his candidacy could overshadow other contenders, including Scott. Additionally, other candidates could enter the race, further complicating Scott's path to the nomination. 5.

Historical Precedent: It's not uncommon for top tennis players to compete in and win multiple events at the Olympics. For instance, the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, have both won multiple gold medals in singles and doubles. Given the right combination of skill, experience, and team dynamics (in doubles), it's entirely plausible for an athlete to win more than one medal. 2. Competition Format: Tennis at the Olympics typically includes singles and doubles events for both men and women, as well as mixed doubles. This variety increases the opportunities for athletes to compete in more than one event and, consequently, win more than one medal. 3. Player Participation: The decision of top players to participate in the Olympics can significantly impact the outcome. While the Olympics are a prestigious event, the tennis calendar is packed, and some players might choose to focus on other tournaments. However, the allure of an Olympic medal often attracts a strong field, increasing the competition but also the likelihood of a talented player dominating. 4. Skill and Form: The form and skill level of the athletes at the time of the Olympics will play a crucial role. An athlete in peak form has a higher chance of winning multiple medals, especially if they are versatile enough to excel in both singles and doubles. 5. Injury and Fatigue: The physical demands of competing in multiple tennis events within a short timeframe should not be underestimated. The risk of injury or fatigue impacting performance increases with each additional event an athlete participates in, which could affect their chances of winning multiple medals. Considering these factors, while it is challenging to predict with certainty, the possibility of an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis at the Olympics is certainly plausible and has historical precedent.

He has gained national attention for his conservative views and his efforts in promoting diversity and inclusion within the Republican Party. However, his national recognition and appeal might not be as broad as some other potential candidates.\n\n2. **Pool of Potential Candidates**: The field of potential Republican candidates for the 2024 presidential election is wide and includes figures like Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, and Ron DeSantis, among others. The presence of such prominent figures, especially Donald Trump, who has a significant base within the party, complicates Scott's path to the nomination.\n\n3. **Republican Party Dynamics**: The dynamics within the Republican Party have been heavily influenced by Donald Trump since his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump's decision on whether to run in 2024 will significantly impact the race. If Trump decides to run, it could overshadow other candidates, including Scott. If Trump does not run, it opens up more opportunities for other candidates, but it also means a potentially more crowded and competitive field.\n\n4. **Primary and Caucus Process**: The process of selecting the Republican nominee involves a series of state primaries and caucuses, culminating in the Republican National Convention. This process tests a candidate's ability to connect with voters across different states, raise funds, and build a robust campaign infrastructure. Scott's success would depend on his ability to perform well in these areas.\n\nConsidering these factors, while Tim Scott has a notable presence within the Republican Party and could potentially attract a significant number of voters, the competition for the 2024 Republican nomination is likely to be fierce.

Chris Christie, a former governor of New Jersey, has been a notable figure in the Republican Party. However, his popularity and influence have waned since his failed presidential bid in 2016. Christie has been critical of Trump, which might alienate him from Trump's base but could also attract Republicans looking for an alternative to Trumpism. Christie has not announced his candidacy for the 2024 election, and his intentions are unclear. Christie faces several challenges, including his past controversies, such as the Bridgegate scandal, and his mixed record as governor. Additionally, he would need to navigate a crowded field and differentiate himself from other candidates who may have stronger national profiles or more robust fundraising capabilities.

The dynamics can shift rapidly based on various factors, including candidate announcements, debates, and primary election results. 2. Tim Scott's Profile: Tim Scott is a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the presidency. He has built a national profile with his response to President Biden's address to Congress and has been involved in high-profile legislative efforts. However, as of the last update, he has not officially declared his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election. 3. Primary Election Dynamics: The outcome of primary elections is notoriously difficult to predict, especially this far in advance. Factors such as voter turnout, campaign funding, media coverage, and endorsements can significantly influence the outcome. Moreover, the preferences of the Republican base and the broader electorate can shift over time, affecting the viability of different candidates. 4. Historical Context: Historically, U.S. presidential elections have been unpredictable, with candidates rising and falling in popularity over the course of the campaign. Early favorites do not always win the nomination, and unexpected events can propel previously underdog candidates into contention. Considering these factors, while Tim Scott has a certain level of national recognition and could potentially be a strong candidate, the field is crowded, and the dynamics of primary elections are inherently unpredictable.

Historical Context and Ideological Differences: The Republicans Party is a center-right political party in France, while the National Rally is positioned on the far-right of the political spectrum. Historically, there has been a significant ideological divide between these two parties, which has generally prevented them from forming alliances. 2. Recent Political Trends and the 2022 Presidential Election: In recent years, especially leading up to and following the 2022 French presidential election, there has been a notable shift in the political dynamics of France. The National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen, has been working to 'de-demonize' its image, aiming to make the party more palatable to a broader audience. Meanwhile, the Republicans Party has faced internal divisions and challenges in maintaining its voter base amidst the rise of Emmanuel Macron's La R\u00e9publique En Marche and the growing popularity of far-right ideologies. 3. Potential for a Tactical Alliance: Given the current political climate, there is a possibility that the Republicans Party might consider a tactical alliance with the National Rally for strategic purposes, such as to counterbalance the influence of President Macron's party or to secure more seats in the National Assembly. Such an alliance would be unprecedented but reflects the evolving nature of French politics. 4. Internal Divisions and External Pressures: Any potential alliance between the two parties would face significant internal and external challenges. Within the Republicans Party, there would likely be substantial resistance from members who oppose the National Rally's ideologies. Externally, an alliance could lead to backlash from other political parties, civil society groups, and the broader public. 5. Conclusion: Considering the factors above, while there is a historical precedent against such an alliance, the shifting political landscape in France means that an electoral alliance or coalition agreement between the Republicans Party and the National Rally for the 2024 French legislative election cannot be entirely ruled out. However, given the significant ideological and practical hurdles, it remains an unlikely scenario."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "3c76378a-5023-462b-883f-6c55070aed4f", "title": "Will the Prime Minister of France belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as Yes if the party of the Prime Minister of France is Together on July 30th, at 12:00 Central European Time, according to credible sources.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-31T11:13:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-06-13T16:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.75, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To answer this question, we need to consider the current political landscape in France and the prospects of the Together coalition, which is a centrist political alliance formed around President Emmanuel Macron. The Prime Minister of France is appointed by the President but must also be able to command the support of the National Assembly to govern effectively. 1. Current Political Context: As of my last update in early 2024, Emmanuel Macron's party, Renaissance (formerly La R\u00e9publique En Marche!), and its allies in the Together coalition were facing significant challenges from both the left (NUPES coalition) and the far right (National Rally). However, Macron's ability to navigate political crises and maintain a centrist coalition has been a hallmark of his presidency. 2. Election and Appointment Processes: The French Prime Minister is appointed by the President, but the appointment must be in line with the political composition of the National Assembly to ensure the government can pass legislation. If the Together coalition maintains a majority or significant influence in the Assembly, it is likely that the Prime Minister will come from this coalition. 3. Recent Trends and Polls: Polls and political trends in France have shown a volatile electorate with shifting allegiances. However, the Together coalition has demonstrated resilience, partly due to the fragmentation of the opposition and Macron's strategic political maneuvering. 4. Potential for Shifts: Until the resolution date of July 30, 2024, there is time for significant political shifts, including changes in public opinion, potential scandals, or economic factors that could influence the composition of the government.

Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, including new polls being released, changes in public opinion, and methodological differences among polls. Given the nature of polling averages, which aggregate data from multiple polls to provide a more stable estimate of public opinion, significant shifts over short periods are less common but can occur, especially in response to major events. The specific range of greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 is quite narrow. For Trump's lead to fall within this range, it suggests a scenario where Trump is leading but not by a wide margin, indicating a competitive race. Historically, polling averages can be volatile, and a lead of this margin can change due to various factors, including campaign events, debates, economic conditions, and external factors that might influence public opinion. Given these considerations, without current data, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

For event (a), Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, several factors come into play: 1. Historical Context and Polling Trends: As of my last update, polling data for the 2024 presidential election is subject to significant fluctuations. Historically, polls this far out from the election have not been highly predictive of the final outcome. However, they can give us a snapshot of current public sentiment. 2. Margin of Error and Polling Variability: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3-4%, which means that small leads (like those within our target range) are often within the margin of error and should be interpreted with caution. 3. External Events: The period leading up to July 2024 is long enough for numerous events to potentially impact public opinion, including debates, policy announcements, and unforeseen domestic or international incidents. Given these considerations, predicting Trump's lead to fall within such a narrow range on a specific date is challenging. While it's plausible, the specificity of the range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points) makes it a relatively low-probability event without more precise current data indicating a stable trend in that direction. For event (b), Larry Elder being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: 1. Primary Election Dynamics: The outcome of primary elections can be highly unpredictable, influenced by factors like voter turnout, debate performances, and the ability of candidates to build momentum at the right time. 2. Establishment vs. Non-Establishment Candidates: The Republican Party's nomination process can sometimes favor establishment candidates, but there's also a significant precedent for non-establishment candidates gaining traction, especially if they have strong grassroots support. 3. Larry Elder's Specific Chances: Without current, specific data on Larry Elder's standing in the polls or his campaign's strength compared to other potential nominees, it's difficult to assess his chances accurately. However, given the crowded and dynamic nature of presidential primaries, unless Elder has a particularly strong showing early on or unique factors in his favor, the probability of him securing the nomination might be considered relatively low compared to more established or currently leading candidates. Combining these assessments, both events (a) and (b) seem to have relatively low probabilities of occurring based on the information provided and the inherent uncertainties in polling and primary election outcomes. However, without specific current data (like recent polling numbers for both scenarios), providing a precise probability is challenging.

Third, there has been no credible evidence widely accepted across the political spectrum indicating President Biden is unable to discharge his duties.

Historical Dominance: Certain countries have historically dominated specific sports. For example, the United States has a strong record in basketball (both 3x3 and 5x5) and volleyball. The Netherlands and Great Britain have been successful in field hockey. Norway and other Scandinavian countries often dominate handball. New Zealand and Australia have strong rugby sevens teams. Understanding these historical trends can help identify which countries might win in multiple sports. Diversity in Sports: The diversity of sports included (association football, 3x3 basketball, 5x5 basketball, field hockey, handball, rugby sevens, volleyball, and water polo) means that different countries have opportunities to excel in different areas. This diversity increases the chances that more countries will win at least one gold medal.

A single loss can eliminate a favorite from contention, which opens the door for underdog teams to win medals.

For event (a), we need to consider the factors that could influence Harris's odds of winning. These could include changes in polling data, endorsements from influential figures, or significant events that impact her campaign. However, without specific information on these factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether her odds will increase. For event (b), we need to consider the likelihood of Biden making a definitive announcement that he will not accept the nomination. This could be influenced by his current health, his campaign's performance, and internal party dynamics. However, it is also difficult to predict with certainty whether Biden will make such an announcement. Given the uncertainty surrounding both events, we can consider the following general factors: The stability of the Democratic primary field: If the field is relatively stable, it is less likely that Harris's odds will increase significantly or that Biden will drop out. The polling data: If polling data shows a significant shift in support towards Harris or away from Biden, it could increase the likelihood of one of these events occurring. External events: Significant external events, such as economic downturns or major scandals, could impact the campaign and influence the likelihood of one of these events occurring. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of either event (a) or event (b) occurring as follows: Probability: 0.3.

Condition (a) - Joe Biden still being officially president of the United States at 11:59 pm on July 31st, 2024 - hinges on several factors, including his health, political standing, and any potential impeachment proceedings or resignation. As of the last available information in early 2024, President Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election, suggesting his intention to remain in office through the end of his term and beyond. However, unforeseen circumstances can always arise. Condition (b) involves a public letter opposing the early nomination plan signed by at least 20 House Members or Senators who caucus with the Democratic Party before the end of Sunday, July 21st, 2024. This scenario depends on internal party dynamics, the level of support for Biden's early nomination within the Democratic Party, and the willingness of party members to publicly oppose leadership's plans. Given the short timeframe for this condition (just over a week from the creation of the question), significant dissent would need to be present and organized within the party for this threshold to be met. Given these considerations: For condition (a), while President Biden's intentions and current political context suggest he will remain in office, the unpredictability of political events, especially in an election year, means there's always some level of uncertainty. For condition (b), the short timeframe and the need for significant, public dissent within the Democratic Party make it a challenging threshold to reach, but not impossible given the right circumstances.

We will analyze each event separately and then consider the overall probability of either event occurring. (a) Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average: To estimate the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range, we need to consider the current polling trends and the uncertainty associated with polling averages. As of the created date (July 8, 2024), the polling average is not provided, but we can assume that Trump's lead is around 2-4 points based on the question's wording. Given the uncertainty in polling and the time remaining until July 15, 2024, it's difficult to predict the exact lead. However, we can assume that the polling average will not change drastically in a short period. Let's assume a normal distribution of the polling average with a mean of 3 (midpoint of the range) and a standard deviation of 1.5 (to account for the uncertainty). Using this distribution, we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4: P(2 < lead \u2264 4) = P(lead \u2264 4) - P(lead \u2264 2) \u2248 0.67 - 0.33 = 0.34. So, the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range is approximately 0.34. (b) Democratic Party having a brokered convention in 2024: A brokered convention occurs when no candidate receives a majority of the delegates in the first round of voting, leading to multiple rounds of voting. To estimate the probability of this event, we need to consider the current state of the Democratic primary and the number of candidates. As of the created date (July 8, 2024), the Democratic primary is likely to be contested, but the exact number of candidates and their delegate counts are not certain. However, we can assume that the probability of a brokered convention is relatively low, given the typical patterns of primary elections. Let's assume a probability of 0.1 for a brokered convention, considering the uncertainty and the historical context of primary elections. Now, we need to calculate the overall probability of either event (a) or event (b) occurring: P(either event) = P(event a) + P(event b) - P(both events). Since events (a) and (b) are independent, P(both events) = P(event a) \u00d7 P(event b) \u2248 0.34 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.034. P(either event) \u2248 0.34 + 0.1 - 0.034 = 0.406. Based on the analysis of Trump's lead in 538's national polling average and the probability of a brokered convention, we estimate the probability of either event occurring."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0019789394901552626, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0006596464967184209, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.06287870496727008, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current Political Standing: As of my last update, Glenn Youngkin is known for winning the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, a notable victory for Republicans in a state that had been trending Democratic. This victory has raised his national profile and could be seen as an asset in a presidential nomination process. 2. Competitive Landscape: The field for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination is expected to be crowded, potentially including high-profile figures such as former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, and other governors, senators, and political personalities. The competition for the nomination will be fierce, and candidates will need to differentiate themselves and build significant support among Republican voters and delegates. 3. Selection Process: The Republican National Convention's process involves primaries and caucuses across the states, leading to the accumulation of delegates who then vote on the nominee at the convention. A candidate needs to win a majority of the delegates to secure the nomination. This process emphasizes both the importance of performing well in key states and the ability to build a broad coalition of support within the party. Given these considerations, while Glenn Youngkin has shown political acumen and success, particularly in his gubernatorial campaign, the crowded and competitive nature of the Republican field, combined with the complex process of securing the nomination, suggests that his path to becoming the nominee would be challenging. Without specific polling data or more detailed information on Youngkin's intentions and the evolving field of candidates, it's difficult to assign a precise probability.

The trial's focus on financial transactions and potential campaign finance violations means Trump's testimony could be crucial, especially if he is directly implicated in the decision-making process behind these payments. 2. **Trump's Past Behavior**: Historically, Donald Trump has been reluctant to testify in court, often preferring to settle cases or invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. This behavior suggests a preference for avoiding direct involvement in legal proceedings when possible. 3. **Legal Context**: If Trump is subpoenaed, he would likely be compelled to testify unless he can successfully argue for an exemption or delay. Given the high profile of the case and its political implications, any attempt to avoid testifying would be heavily scrutinized and potentially challenged in court. 4. **Political Considerations**: Trump's decision to testify or not will also be influenced by political considerations, including the potential impact on his public image and any future political aspirations. Testifying could provide an opportunity to present his side of the story but also risks further entangling him in legal controversies.

His influence over the party and his ability to raise funds are considerable advantages. 2. Potential Challengers: The field of potential challengers within the Republican Party includes several notable figures, such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence, among others. The ability of these candidates to gain traction and support within the party, as well as their potential to appeal to a broader electorate, could impact Trump's chances.

Understanding the Source: The resolution source for this market is FiveThirtyEight's 2024 presidential election forecast. Specifically, the numbers indicated by the blue and red trend lines for the market's resolution date, which is July 19, 2024, will be used. 2. Methodology Changes: Any changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates its figures will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. This means we should focus solely on the reported probabilities without worrying about how they were calculated. 3. Resolution Criteria: The market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Joe Biden has a higher probability of winning than Donald Trump according to the forecast for July 19, 2024. It will resolve to \"No\" if Trump's probability is higher, and it will resolve 50-50 if their odds are equal. 4. Availability of Data: The market will resolve according to the datapoints for July 19 as soon as datapoints for July 20 become available. If no datapoints for July 19 are available by July 22, 11:59 PM ET, the market will resolve according to the nearest previous figures to July 19. Given these points, to estimate the probability of this market resolving to \"Yes\", we would ideally need access to current polling data and trends up to the point of making the forecast. However, without direct access to real-time data or the ability to fetch the latest forecasts from FiveThirtyEight or other sources, we must rely on general knowledge and the typical behavior of election forecasts. Historically, election forecasts can fluctuate significantly in the months leading up to an election due to various factors such as debates, policy announcements, and external events. However, without specific information on the current political climate, recent polling trends, or significant events that could sway public opinion, making a precise forecast is challenging. Given the lack of specific, up-to-date information, a forecaster would typically look at historical trends and the general political landscape. Since I cannot access real-time data or specific trends as of the moment of this query, and given the instructions to provide a detailed reasoning followed by a probability estimate, I must emphasize that any estimate provided here is highly speculative and based on the structure of the question rather than current, specific data. Given the speculative nature of this response and the lack of direct evidence to inform a precise probability, the most prudent approach is to acknowledge the limitations of this forecast. Probability: 0.5 This estimate reflects a neutral stance, acknowledging the binary nature of the outcome without specific evidence to skew the probability significantly in either direction.

Condition 1: Joe Biden has a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Donald Trump according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for the day of July 19, 2024. Condition 2: Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's national polling average for the 2024 presidential election is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 points as reported on the chart for the date of July 15, 2024. First, let's consider Condition 1. The FiveThirtyEight election forecast is a sophisticated model that incorporates a wide range of data, including polling, economic indicators, and demographic trends. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at current trends and the general state of the election. As of the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), the election is still several months away, and a lot can happen between now and then. However, if we assume that the current trends hold, it's possible that Biden could be favored by the model, especially if he maintains a strong polling lead or if Trump's campaign faces significant challenges. Next, let's consider Condition 2. This condition requires Trump's lead over Biden to be within a specific range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 points) on July 15, 2024. Polling averages can fluctuate rapidly, and a 2-4 point lead is relatively narrow. Given the volatility of polls, it's possible that Trump's lead could fall within this range, but it's also possible that it could be outside of this range or that Biden could be leading. Given these considerations, it's difficult to assign a high probability to either condition being met. However, it's also difficult to rule out either condition entirely. A reasonable approach is to consider the probability of each condition being met and then combine them to get an overall probability. Assuming that the probability of Condition 1 being met is around 0.4 (based on current trends and the uncertainty of the election) and the probability of Condition 2 being met is around 0.3 (based on the volatility of polls and the narrow range of the lead), we can combine these probabilities to get an overall probability. Since the two conditions are mutually exclusive (i.e., they cannot both be true at the same time), we can add the probabilities together. However, we need to be careful not to double-count the probability of both conditions being met, so we'll use the inclusion-exclusion principle to combine the probabilities. Let's assume that the probability of both conditions being met is approximately 0.05 (a rough estimate, as it's difficult to quantify). We can then calculate the overall probability as follows: P(Condition 1 or Condition 2) = P(Condition 1) + P(Condition 2) - P(Both conditions) P(Condition 1 or Condition 2) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.05 P(Condition 1 or Condition 2) = 0.65. The probability of either condition being met is difficult to quantify, but by considering current trends and the uncertainty of the election, we can estimate the probability of each condition and combine them to get an overall probability."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.01200395279237032, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.004001317597456773, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15504341823651052, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, their model incorporates a wide range of data, including polls, economic indicators, and other factors.

Condition (a) involves Meta publishing a public report with results from an external party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models by June 30, 2024. The practice of red-teaming, especially by external parties, is increasingly recognized as a valuable method for identifying vulnerabilities and improving the safety and security of AI systems. Given the growing emphasis on AI safety and the transparency required to ensure public trust, it's plausible that Meta would engage in such practices and potentially publish the results. However, the specific timeline and the public nature of the report are critical factors. Companies like Meta often conduct internal reviews and may not always make the findings public, especially if they reveal significant vulnerabilities. The likelihood of this happening by June 30, 2024, depends on Meta's current priorities, the maturity of their AI safety initiatives, and their strategy for transparency and public engagement. Condition (b) pertains to the linked market achieving at least 377 traders before market close on July 15. This condition's likelihood is influenced by the visibility of the market, the interest in the question among potential traders, and the overall activity level of the platform. Without specific data on the current number of traders and the growth rate of the market, it's challenging to estimate this directly. However, achieving such a specific number of traders could be influenced by factors like the relevance of the question, the ease of market access, and any incentives for participation.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update in 2023, the Republican field for the 2024 presidential election is wide open. Several candidates have expressed interest or are rumored to be considering a run. The lack of a clear frontrunner makes it a competitive race. 2. Will Hurd's Background: Will Hurd is a former CIA officer and served as a U.S. Representative from Texas's 23rd congressional district from 2015 to 2021. He has a unique background that could appeal to some voters, especially given his experience in national security. However, his relatively low national profile compared to other potential candidates might be a disadvantage. 3. Fundraising and Support: A successful presidential campaign requires significant fundraising capabilities and support from major donors and grassroots contributors. As of my last update, there isn't substantial information indicating Hurd has built the necessary financial backing to compete with more established names. 4. Primary Election Dynamics: The Republican primary process involves a series of state-by-state contests that can be unpredictable. Candidates need to perform well in early states to gain momentum. Without a strong showing in these initial contests, it's challenging for a candidate to remain viable. 5. Party Establishment Support: The support of the Republican Party establishment can significantly influence the nomination process. Candidates endorsed or favored by party leaders often have an advantage in terms of resources and media attention. It's unclear as of now whether Hurd would receive such support. Considering these factors, while Will Hurd has a unique profile that could attract some voters, the lack of a strong national presence, the competitive nature of the Republican field, and the uncertainties around his fundraising capabilities and party support make his path to the nomination challenging."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "35866a7a-129d-4db3-90f2-280a03b0f9e4", "title": "[Metaculus] Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democra...nomination for President?", "body": "Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nResolves the same as the original on Metaculus.\n\n(https://www.metaculus.com/questions/question_embed/25755/?theme=dark)Resolution criteria\n\nThis question will resolve as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.\n\nTo qualify for a Yes resolution, the statement must be unambiguous and conclusive: it should leave no room for the possibility that Biden would accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nIf such a definitive statement is not made prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, this question will resolve as No.\n\nFine print and additional background information can be found on Metaculus.\n\nOnce the original resolves, its resolution will be applied to this market automatically.

First, let's look at what Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states. It prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The application of this section to Donald Trump would depend on whether his actions, particularly those surrounding the events of January 6, 2021, could be classified as engaging in insurrection or rebellion. As of my last update, there have been ongoing investigations and legal debates regarding Trump's involvement and responsibility for the January 6th insurrection. The outcome of these investigations and any subsequent legal proceedings would significantly influence whether Trump could be removed or blocked from a primary election ballot under the grounds of the 14th Amendment. However, it's essential to note that any legal process, including investigations, potential indictments, trials, and appeals, can be lengthy and may not be resolved by July 15, 2024. Furthermore, the process to remove or block a candidate from a ballot varies by state, adding another layer of complexity and uncertainty to the outcome. Additionally, the political implications and the potential for public and partisan backlash against any move to remove or block a candidate as prominent as Donald Trump must be considered. Such actions could have significant implications for the political landscape of the United States, affecting both the primary and general elections in 2024. Given these considerations, while it's possible that Donald Trump could face legal challenges regarding his eligibility to hold federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the likelihood of these challenges being resolved in a manner that results in his removal or blocking from any U.S. state's primary election ballot by July 15, 2024, seems relatively low. The complexity of the legal processes, the time required to reach a definitive conclusion, and the political dynamics involved suggest that a resolution within this timeframe is unlikely. Therefore, based on the available information and the considerations outlined above, my probability estimate for Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as of July 15, 2024, is: Probability: 0.15"}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "a98b0b89-5de2-4408-8de4-3d015a376460", "title": "Will either Elon Musk appear at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or Donald Trump be removed from a primary election ballot under the 14th Amendment?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n(b) On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

The question resolves to YES if either of these events occurs. First, let's consider Elon Musk appearing at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024. Elon Musk has shown interest in cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in the past, and it's not entirely unlikely that he could be invited as a guest to a major Bitcoin conference. However, without any specific information about an invitation or confirmation of his attendance, it's difficult to estimate this probability accurately. Given Musk's busy schedule and the variety of engagements he could potentially have, a rough estimate might place this probability in the range of 5% to 10%. Next, we consider the event of Donald Trump being removed from a primary election ballot under the 14th Amendment. This scenario involves complex legal and political processes. The 14th Amendment, specifically Section 3, is a rarely invoked part of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The process of removing a candidate from a ballot under these grounds would likely involve significant legal battles, court decisions, and official state government actions. Given the unprecedented nature of such an event and the political and legal hurdles involved, the probability of this occurring might be estimated in the range of 1% to 5%. Given these are two independent events, we can calculate the overall probability of either event occurring by adding their probabilities. However, because we're estimating ranges rather than precise figures, we need to approach this qualitatively. If we take the higher end of both ranges (10% for Elon Musk appearing at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and 5% for Donald Trump being removed from a ballot), the combined probability could be seen as approximately the sum of these two, around 15%.

However, Czechia has shown the ability to select entries that appeal to both the public and the juries in the past. 3. Competition: The level of competition in Eurovision is high, with many countries investing significant resources into their entries. The competition in the semi-finals, from which Czechia must qualify, is particularly fierce, as countries compete for a limited number of spots in the Grand Final. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by geographical and cultural factors, with countries often voting for their neighbors or countries with which they have cultural ties. Czechia, being a Central European country, might benefit from votes from neighboring countries, but this is not a reliable factor to count on for qualification. 5. Recent Trends: Recent years have shown a slight shift in voting patterns, with juries and public votes sometimes diverging significantly.

Director's Track Record: Lee Isaac Chung, the director of 'Twisters' (2024), has a notable track record. His film 'Minari' (2020) received widespread critical acclaim, with a 98% Rotten Tomatoes score. This suggests Chung has the ability to create films that resonate with critics. 2. Cast: The film stars Glen Powell ('Top Gun: Maverick') and Daisy Edgar-Jones ('Normal People'), both of whom have been involved in successful projects. While the cast's past successes do not guarantee a high Rotten Tomatoes score, they do bring a level of credibility and appeal that could positively influence the film's reception. 3. Standalone Sequel Nature: Being a standalone sequel to the 1996 original, 'Twisters' (2024) has the challenge of living up to or surpassing the original's reputation. Standalone sequels can be hit or miss, but given the time gap and the fresh perspective from a new director, there's potential for a compelling narrative that both honors the original and brings something new. 4. Genre and Critics' Expectations: Action-adventure films, especially those involving natural disasters like tornadoes, can be subject to a wide range of critical reception. However, the involvement of a critically acclaimed director and a cast with proven track records could elevate the film beyond typical genre expectations. 5. Marketing and Hype: The level of marketing and hype surrounding the film could also impact its critical reception. A well-executed marketing campaign could generate positive buzz, potentially influencing critics' expectations and perceptions. Considering these factors, while there's no guarantee of success, the elements are in place for 'Twisters' (2024) to receive a positive critical reception.

Franchise Popularity and Growth: The popularity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and related franchises has grown significantly since the release of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine.' The success of these films, along with the broader X-Men franchise, has likely expanded the fan base, potentially leading to a higher box office opening for 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' 2. Marketing and Hype: The announcement of a joint film featuring two of the most beloved characters from the X-Men universe is likely to generate substantial hype. The marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could capitalize on this excitement, drawing in fans eager to see the dynamic between these characters explored on the big screen. 3. Cinematic Universe Expansion: The integration of the X-Men universe into the MCU following Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox could also boost interest in 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' Fans curious about how these characters will be integrated into the larger MCU might flock to see the film, contributing to a higher opening weekend. 4. Inflation and Ticket Price Increases: Since 2016 and 2013, ticket prices have increased due to inflation and other factors. This natural increase in ticket prices could contribute to a higher box office opening for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' without necessarily indicating more tickets sold. 5. Competitive Landscape: The competitive landscape of movie releases around the time 'Deadpool & Wolverine' comes out could impact its box office performance.

However, being a media personality and a political candidate are vastly different roles. While his media presence gives him a platform and potential donor base, it doesn't directly translate to political viability or the organizational infrastructure needed for a presidential campaign. 2. Political Experience: Carlson lacks direct political experience, having never held elected office. This is a significant factor since the Republican Party often nominates candidates with political experience, whether at the state or federal level. 3. Competition: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could include seasoned politicians and possibly former President Donald Trump, who has hinted at running again. Such competition would make it challenging for Carlson to stand out and secure the nomination. 4. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party's internal dynamics and the preferences of its base are crucial. While Carlson is popular among some segments of the party, it's unclear whether he could broaden his appeal enough to secure the nomination. 5.

The leap from television to the top of the ticket would be unprecedented.

Condition A: Nikki Haley Being the Republican Nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. As of my last update in 2023, Nikki Haley has indeed announced her candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, the field of candidates for the Republican nomination can be quite large, and the outcome is far from certain. The nomination process involves a series of primaries and caucuses across the United States, culminating in the Republican National Convention, where delegates officially select the party's nominee. Predicting the outcome of this process is complex due to the numerous factors at play, including candidate popularity, campaign funding, debate performances, and the preferences of various factions within the Republican Party. While Nikki Haley has a certain level of recognition and support, other candidates, including incumbent President Donald Trump (if he decides to run), could pose significant challenges to her nomination. Given these considerations, it's difficult to assign a precise probability to Nikki Haley securing the nomination without more up-to-date information on her campaign's progress and the overall political landscape. However, as a rough estimate based on historical trends and the competitive nature of the primaries, one might cautiously suggest a probability in the range of 10% to 20%. Condition B: Joe Biden's Death Before Saturday. Predicting the death of an individual is inherently uncertain and morbid. However, for the sake of answering the question, we can look at actuarial tables and consider Joe Biden's age and reported health status. As of 2023, Joe Biden is 80 years old, and while he has had health issues, he appears to be in relatively good health for his age. The probability of death within a short time frame (in this case, before the end of Friday, July 26th) for an otherwise healthy individual is quite low. Actuarial tables can provide some guidance, but without specific health information, it's challenging to give an exact figure. A very rough estimate might place this probability in the range of 0.1% to 1%. Combining the Probabilities: To find the overall probability of either event happening, we add the probabilities of the two independent events. Based on the rough estimates provided: Condition A (Nikki Haley nomination): 10% to 20%; Condition B (Joe Biden's death): 0.1% to 1%. The combined probability would then range from 10.1% to 21%. Given the wide range and the rough nature of these estimates, selecting a precise probability within this range is somewhat arbitrary without further information. The above analysis provides a detailed breakdown of the factors influencing the two conditions that could lead to a 'Yes' resolution.

Health and Age: President Biden's health and age are significant factors. Born on November 20, 1942, he will be 81 years old by the end of July 2024. While he has had health issues in the past, there's no public indication that these issues are currently debilitating enough to force him out of office. 2. Resignation: There's no current indication or precedent to suggest that President Biden plans to resign. His administration has been focused on various policy initiatives, and there's no public evidence of any intent to leave office prematurely. 3. Impeachment and Removal: Impeachment by the House of Representatives followed by a trial in the Senate could potentially remove President Biden from office. However, given the current political makeup of the Senate and the high threshold required for conviction (two-thirds of the Senate), this seems unlikely unless there's a significant shift in political dynamics or compelling evidence of wrongdoing that garners bipartisan support for removal. 4. 25th Amendment: The question explicitly states that temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment does not constitute a resolution of NO. Therefore, unless President Biden permanently relinquishes his duties due to incapacitation (which is not currently indicated), this factor does not contribute to a NO resolution. 5. Historical Precedent: Historically, U.S. Presidents have served out their terms unless faced with extraordinary circumstances (e.g., resignation due to scandal, severe health issues, or death). There's no indication that President Biden faces such circumstances. Given these considerations, the likelihood of President Biden remaining in office through the end of July 2024 appears high. The absence of clear indicators of resignation, severe health issues that would necessitate permanent incapacitation, or political conditions ripe for impeachment and removal all contribute to this assessment."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "3cd56d9e-2c31-43da-8797-1a963735b92f", "title": "Will Ron DeSantis be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Ron DeSantis is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Secondly, we should consider the possibility of resignation or removal from office. While these are possibilities, they are rare in U.S. history. Only a few presidents have resigned or been impeached and removed from office. The process for impeachment and removal is also quite lengthy and involves both the House of Representatives and the Senate, making a sudden removal before the end of July unlikely without significant prior proceedings. Lastly, we should consider health factors. While the health of any individual can change suddenly, Joe Biden would have access to the best medical care available. Unless there is specific information about his health declining significantly, it's difficult to predict his presidency ending due to health reasons before the end of July 2024.

Understanding the Source: The question references FiveThirtyEight's (538) national polling average for the 2024 presidential election. 538 is known for its rigorous statistical analysis and aggregation of polls, making it a reliable source for understanding election trends. 2. Polling Averages and Their Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate based on numerous factors, including but not limited to, recent events, candidate performance in debates or public appearances, economic conditions, and even the methodology of the polls included in the average. The lead between candidates, especially in a general election, can shift over time due to these factors. 3. Historical Context: As of the creation of this question in June 2023, the election is still over a year away. Polls this far out from an election are generally considered less predictive of the final outcome. The closer we get to the election date, the more predictive polls become. 4. Range Specificity: The question asks for a very specific outcome (a lead greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4 points) on a specific date (July 15, 2024). This specificity makes the question inherently harder to predict accurately, as small changes in public opinion or polling methodology could shift Trump's lead out of this narrow range. 5. External Factors: Between now and July 2024, numerous events could influence public opinion, such as debates, policy announcements, economic shifts, and unforeseen global events. These factors can cause fluctuations in polling averages. Given these considerations, predicting a specific lead within a one-point range over a year in advance involves a high degree of uncertainty. While it's possible that Trump could have a lead within this range, the specificity of the question and the inherent volatility of public opinion over time make it challenging to assign a high probability to such a precise outcome."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "44070e69-f4ed-4941-b908-486d252991ae", "title": "Will Glenn Youngkin be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Glenn Youngkin is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Historical Performance of Swimmers: Historically, swimmers have been among the top medal winners at the Olympics. Swimmers like Michael Phelps, who holds the record for the most gold medals won by an individual in Olympic history, demonstrate the potential for swimmers to accumulate a large number of gold medals due to the multiple events available in the sport. 2. Number of Events: Swimming offers a wide range of events, which increases the chances for swimmers to win multiple medals. This is in contrast to many other sports that have fewer events, limiting the potential for athletes in those sports to accumulate as many medals. 3. Competition and Talent Distribution: The talent pool in swimming is deep, but the nature of the sport allows for athletes to specialize in specific events, increasing their chances of winning. Additionally, the fact that swimming is a highly competitive sport globally means that the best swimmers are often pushed to excel, potentially leading to a higher concentration of medals among top performers. 4. Olympic Program Changes: The Olympic program for 2024 includes changes that might affect medal distribution, such as the addition of new sports or the adjustment of events within existing sports. However, swimming remains a core sport with a large number of events. 5. Global Participation and Trends: The global participation in swimming is high, and trends suggest that countries are investing heavily in swimming programs, which could lead to a wider distribution of medals but also could push top swimmers to win more medals due to the increased competition.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update, Liz Cheney has been a significant figure within the Republican Party, especially noted for her role as the Chair of the House Republican Conference. However, her outspoken criticism of former President Donald Trump, particularly concerning his role in the January 6, 2021, storming of the US Capitol, has led to significant backlash within her own party. This includes being removed from her leadership position and facing a primary challenge in her Wyoming congressional district. 2. Primary Challenges and Support: Cheney's decision to focus on the January 6 committee and her vocal stance against Trump have alienated her from a substantial portion of the Republican base, which remains loyal to Trump. While she has garnered support from some Republicans and independents for her stance, the Republican primary electorate may not favor her due to her perceived disloyalty to Trump. 3. Historical Context and Republican Nomination Process: The Republican nomination process tends to favor candidates who can consolidate support from a broad spectrum of the party. Historically, candidates who have been more aligned with the party's establishment or its most vocal base have succeeded in securing the nomination. Given Cheney's current standing within the party, it seems unlikely she would be able to garner the broad support needed to secure the nomination. 4. Potential Candidates and Competition: The field for the 2024 Republican nomination could include several candidates, including Trump himself, who has hinted at a possible run. Other potential candidates might include figures like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence, among others. In a crowded field, Cheney's path to the nomination would be even more challenging.

Current Stance and Past Statements: As of my last update, Joe Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. However, intentions can change due to various factors, including health issues, political pressures, or personal reasons. 2. Health and Age: Joe Biden's age and health status are significant factors.

However, as of now, there hasn't been any definitive indication that his health would prevent him from seeking re-election. 3. Political Climate: The political landscape can significantly influence Biden's decision. Factors such as his approval ratings, the state of the economy, and the potential Republican nominees could all play a role. If the political climate turns unfavorable, it might increase the likelihood of Biden deciding not to run. 4. Democratic Party Dynamics: The dynamics within the Democratic Party, including support from key figures and the emergence of potential challengers, could also influence Biden's decision.

For event (a), 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 receiving an IMDB rating greater than 8.5 two days after its release: Season 1 of 'House of the Dragon' had IMDB ratings ranging from 8.0 to 9.3, indicating a strong overall reception. Season 2 ratings so far range from 6.1 to 9.6, showing more variability but still with episodes reaching high ratings. Given that S2E8 is the season finale, it might receive higher ratings due to its climactic nature and conclusion of story arcs, which often draw more viewers and higher engagement. However, achieving a rating strictly greater than 8.5 is challenging, and only a portion of the episodes have reached this threshold in the past. Considering these points, while there's a reasonable chance for S2E8 to achieve a high rating, the strict requirement of it being greater than 8.5 makes the probability somewhat lower. Let's tentatively estimate this probability as 0.4. For event (b), M. Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) receiving a CinemaScore of B or higher: Recent M. Night Shyamalan films have received CinemaScores ranging from C to B+, indicating a mixed but generally positive audience response. A CinemaScore of B or higher is within the range of his recent films, suggesting it's plausible for 'Trap' to achieve this. However, CinemaScores can be unpredictable, as they depend on immediate audience reactions, which can vary widely. Given the range of recent CinemaScores for Shyamalan's films, and without more specific information about 'Trap,' we might estimate a somewhat lower probability for achieving a B or higher, considering the mixed responses to his work. Let's tentatively estimate this probability as 0.35. To find the combined probability of either event (a) or (b) occurring, we use the formula for the union of two events, which is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). However, since these events are independent (the IMDB rating of 'House of the Dragon' and the CinemaScore of 'Trap' do not directly influence each other), P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Therefore, the calculation would be 0.4 + 0.35 - (0.4 * 0.35). Let's calculate: 0.4 + 0.35 - 0.14 = 0.61. Thus, the probability that either 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 will be rated >8.5 on IMDB 2 days after release, or M. Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) will receive a CinemaScore of B or above is 0.61."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.009010263837178234, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0030034212790594115, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.13432835820895517, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
