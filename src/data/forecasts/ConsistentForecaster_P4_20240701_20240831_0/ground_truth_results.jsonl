Instead, there are reports of potential oil spills in other regions, such as the Red Sea, due to different circumstances.\n    - There is no indication of militant activity targeting tankers in the Laptev Sea in the available sources.\n\n    Given the lack of information on a major oil spill in the Laptev Sea caused by a militant attack on a tanker, and considering the resolution date has passed, we can conclude that no such event has occurred by the specified date.", "can_resolve_question": true, "answer": false}}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"metadata": null, "prob": 0.1}, "prob": 0.1, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.152, "brier_score": 0.01, "brier_score_scaled": 96.0, "platt": {"factor": 1.6562, "calibrated_prob": 0.0216, "brier_score": 0.0005, "brier_score_scaled": 99.8, "log_score": 0.0315}}

The bank's management aimed to increase the unsecured loans to 15% of the total loans from 11%.\n\n    2. **Impact of Digital Curbs**: However, the bank faced a ban on digital onboarding of customers and issuing new credit cards, which impacted its unsecured loan book growth and margins during the April-June quarter (Q1FY25). Despite this, the bank reported an 18% increase in customer assets, including advances and credit substitutes, in the first quarter of FY24.\n\n    3. **Performance in Q1FY25**: The bank's unsecured retail advances accounted for 10.7% of net advances as of June 30, up from 7.9% a year ago, showing growth across segments such as credit cards, personal and business loans, and MFI.\n\n    4. **Future Projections**: The bank's management expressed confidence that once the digital curbs are lifted, the unsecured lending business will grow more strongly.\n\n    Given these points, it is clear that Kotak Mahindra Bank's unsecured lending business has shown growth up to the first quarter of FY25, despite the challenges posed by digital curbs. The growth is evident in the increase in unsecured retail advances and the bank's efforts to expand this segment.\n\n    Therefore, the question can be resolved based on the available information.", "can_resolve_question": true, "answer": true}}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": null, "prob": 0.65}, "prob": 0.65, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.6215, "brier_score": 0.1225, "brier_score_scaled": 51.0, "platt": {"factor": 1.6562, "calibrated_prob": 0.3288, "brier_score": 0.4505, "brier_score_scaled": -80.2, "log_score": 1.6046}}

This ruling indicates that as of August 1, 2024, the law permitting abortions up to 18 weeks has not been changed.\n\n    2. **Legal Challenges**: The current legal challenges and the court's decision to keep the injunction in place suggest that any changes to the law are on hold until further legal proceedings.\n\n    3. **Legislative Actions**: There are proposals to shorten the window for abortions, such as the one by State Sen. Dan McCay to make abortions illegal after six weeks of pregnancy, but these have not yet been enacted into law.\n\n    Given these points, as of the latest information available up to August 2024, Utah's abortion law allowing procedures up to 18 weeks remains unchanged.
