Given Musk's previous involvement in Bitcoin discussions and events, I would estimate a relatively high probability, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P** (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?): This is the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P** (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?): This question is closely related to P, so I would assign a similar probability, around 0.60, indicating that it is indeed possible for him to attend.\n\n4. **Q** (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?): Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin and its community, I would estimate this probability to be moderate, around 0.50.\n\n5. **P_and_Q** (Will both P and Q occur?): This joint probability requires both events to happen. Assuming P is 0.60 and Q is 0.50, I would estimate P_and_Q to be 0.30, reflecting the overlap of the two probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q** (Will either P or Q occur?): This is calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q would be 0.60 + 0.50 - 0.30 = 0.80, suggesting a high likelihood that at least one of the events will happen.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P** (Will both Q occur and not P occur?): This means that Musk makes a statement but does not show up at the conference. I would estimate this to be lower, around 0.20, as it requires Musk to engage with Bitcoin publicly while not attending the specific event.\n\n8. **Q_given_P** (Given that Musk shows up at the conference, will he make a public statement about Bitcoin?): If he is present at the conference, the likelihood that he makes a statement is higher, so I would estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\nOverall, the probabilities are interdependent, with P and not_P being complementary, and P_and_Q being a function of both P and Q. The estimates should respect the consistency rules, ensuring that they align mathematically.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.50) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.70 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "72a6fdfd-7af9-4af1-86ba-f705c9126260", "title": "Will Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee and Mike Pence not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following occur: (a) Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (b) Mike Pence is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given Musk's past involvement in Bitcoin discussions and events, I estimate the probability of him showing up at the conference at around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P, so I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin and his tendency to make statements about it, I estimate this probability at 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This requires both events to happen. Given the probabilities of P and Q, I would estimate P_and_Q at 0.45, assuming some positive correlation between Musk's attendance and his statements.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is a union of the two events. Using the probabilities of P and Q, I would estimate P_or_Q at 0.85, as either event is likely to happen based on historical patterns.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while not P occurs?)**: This scenario requires Q to happen while P does not. Given my estimates, I would assign this a probability of 0.25, reflecting the possibility of Musk making statements without attending the specific conference.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability assumes that if Musk attends the conference, he is likely to make a statement about Bitcoin. I would estimate this at around 0.80, as his attendance would likely lead to public comments.\n\nIn summary, the events are interrelated: if P occurs, it increases the likelihood of Q occurring, and vice versa. The estimates are designed to respect the consistency rules, ensuring that the relationships between these events are logically coherent.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "995008e8-3a23-4f5b-9b26-47149fca7c05", "title": "Will either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his previous engagements with Bitcoin and the crypto community, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 that he will attend.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complementary event to P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would be 1 - 0.65 = 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P but is more about the possibility rather than certainty. I would estimate this slightly higher, at 0.70, as it encompasses a broader range of scenarios.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of making public statements about Bitcoin, I estimate this probability at 0.60.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This event requires both P and Q to happen. The probability can be calculated as a product of their individual probabilities, assuming some independence, which gives us 0.65 * 0.60 = 0.39.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. So, 0.65 + 0.60 - 0.39 = 0.86.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This requires Q to happen while P does not. Assuming independence, this can be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.60 * 0.35 = 0.21.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability is typically estimated based on how likely Q is when P is true.

However, attendance can be influenced by many factors, including scheduling conflicts, personal preferences, and public sentiment toward Bitcoin at the time.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If the probability of him attending is estimated at a certain level, the probability of him not attending will be the remaining value up to 1. \n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P and would likely carry a similar probability estimate, assuming that if he shows up, it is indeed possible.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given his history of commenting on Bitcoin and the ongoing relevance of Bitcoin in news cycles, this event might have a higher probability.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability would depend on the individual probabilities of P and Q, and since both events are somewhat independent, the estimate would likely be lower than either individual probability.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This combines the probabilities of both events occurring. The estimate should reflect that it is more likely than either event occurring alone due to the nature of the OR condition.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This scenario is also a combination of probabilities but reflects a specific relationship where Musk makes a statement without attending the conference. The estimate would need to consider the independence of these events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This conditional probability would likely be higher than the unconditional probability of Q since Musk attending the conference may increase the chances of him making a statement about Bitcoin.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these events are interdependent, with various probabilities needing to adhere to the consistency rules outlined. Each probability estimate should be adjusted to ensure that they conform to the mathematical relationships defined in the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.90 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.90 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "3ba6f343-854f-452b-a6fc-d623fc1780c1", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee and Nikki Haley not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (2) Nikki Haley is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Since I estimate P at 0.65, not_P would logically be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P, so I would assign it the same probability as P, which is 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of making statements about Bitcoin, I would estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: The occurrence of both events is less likely than either occurring individually. I would estimate this to be around 0.40 based on the intersection of the two probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given the probabilities for P and Q, I would calculate this by using the formula for the union of two events: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. This would yield a probability of approximately 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.40 = 0.95.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024 and not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a more complex event, but if we assume that the probability of him making a statement is independent of him attending the event, I would estimate this to be around 0.30.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will he make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: This conditional probability would likely be high, as his attendance could correlate with making statements about Bitcoin. I would estimate this to be around 0.80.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that all probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between the events and their complements.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\nP_or_Q: 0.95,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.80,\npara_P: 0.65\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.95 + 0.40 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.95 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.95 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\nP_or_Q: 0.95,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.80,\npara_P: 0.65\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "e08bba25-eb80-4f83-bdf3-89d56143e63e", "title": "Will either Nikki Haley or Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Nikki Haley or Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The probability of Musk attending may depend on his schedule and interest in Bitcoin at that time. Given his previous engagements and interest in cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.60 for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complementary event to P. Since the total probability must equal 1, I estimate not_P at 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially asking if there is any chance Musk could attend. Given that he has a history of engaging with the Bitcoin community, I would assign a higher probability, around 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency discussions, I would assign a probability of 0.75 for him making a public statement about Bitcoin.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Musk shows up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: The likelihood of both events occurring together is less than either event alone. I estimate this joint probability at 0.45.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Musk shows up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: This would be higher than both individual probabilities. I estimate this probability at 0.85 since at least one of these events is likely to happen.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin but does not show up at the conference)**: This scenario is plausible, especially if he discusses Bitcoin at another event. I estimate this probability at 0.30.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will he make a public statement about Bitcoin?)**: If Musk attends, it\u2019s likely he will mention Bitcoin, so I would estimate this at 0.80.\n\nOverall, the events are interrelated, with P and Q having a strong correlation, as attendance might lead to a public statement. I will ensure that the probabilities adhere to the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\nfailed_check_cond, failed_check_para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.32172514280618925, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.10724171426872975, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.8390607775994223, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
