Given his previous engagements and interest in Bitcoin, I estimate a moderate probability of this happening.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at a certain probability, not_P should be 1 minus that probability. This relationship must hold true.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P and should share the same probability, as it essentially asks the same thing but in a different form. \n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given the ongoing interest in Bitcoin and Musk\u2019s influence in the cryptocurrency space, I would assign a reasonable probability to this event occurring.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q happen)**: This probability must take into account both events happening simultaneously. The probability of P_and_Q is generally less than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q, and it cannot exceed the probability of either event occurring alone.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q happens)**: This probability must be calculated as the probability of P plus the probability of Q minus the probability of both happening (P_and_Q). This ensures that we do not double-count the scenarios where both events occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q happens and P does not)**: This probability is interesting because it assesses the situation where Musk makes a statement about Bitcoin but does not attend the conference. This should be less than or equal to the probability of Q.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (If P happens, will Q happen?)**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q occurring given that P has occurred. It should be directly influenced by the relationship between P and Q.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that the probabilities assigned to each event adhere to the consistency rules, particularly the relationships between P and not_P, as well as the calculations for P_and_Q and P_or_Q. This will involve careful estimation based on the interdependencies of the events.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.77\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.77 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.69\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-26T17:51:56.319202", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('1440324e-0ef4-49b9-9022-987a965f4a74'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('43bbc0ba-11a1-4b40-bd97-f2007bfec292'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('44c99fef-02e3-4bac-b01c-b7e2211b9678'), title='Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the biggest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('598f8699-71d9-46d9-a676-79e9fbac61f1'), title='Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?', body='This question will resolve as Yes if Elon Musk publicly discusses Bitcoin at any event in 2024, regardless of whether he attends Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or not.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_and_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('74c11c69-ebe3-420d-b534-41b9eead6606'), title='Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (taking place on July 25-27, 2024) and (2) Elon Musk publicly discusses Bitcoin at any event in 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES if (1) Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024, and (2) Elon Musk publicly discusses Bitcoin at any event in 2024, regardless of whether he attends Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or not.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_or_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7babad5e-f624-467a-97eb-b6812932a97e'), title='Will either of the following occur: (a) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?

Given Musk's history with Bitcoin, I estimate this probability to be moderately high, around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P should be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I will keep it at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's active role in the cryptocurrency space and his tendency to make public comments, I estimate this probability to be high, around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk shows up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and (2) he publicly discusses Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: The probability of both events happening together is less than either occurring independently, so I estimate this to be around 0.45.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either of the following occur: (a) Musk shows up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or (b) he makes a public statement about Bitcoin in 2024?)**: This should be higher than either P or Q individually, so I estimate this at 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both of the following occur: (1) Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin and (2) he does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This scenario is plausible, so I estimate this probability at 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will he make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: If he attends the event, it is likely he will make a statement, so I estimate this at 0.75.\n\nIn summary, P and not_P are complementary, and I must ensure that the other relationships between the questions also respect the consistency rules.

If we estimate a probability for P, then not_P should equal 1 - P. This relationship will guide our estimates for these two variables.\n\n2. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)** is closely related to P, and we can assume it has a similar probability since both questions revolve around the same event. Therefore, para_P should have a probability close to that of P.\n\n3. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)** is independent of P and not_P, as it does not rely on his attendance at the Bitcoin Nashville event. However, we can estimate its probability based on Musk's previous engagement with Bitcoin.\n\n4. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)** depends on both P and Q being true. We can estimate this using the multiplication rule for independent events, which means P_and_Q should be less than or equal to the smaller of P and Q.\n\n5. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)** will be influenced by both P and Q. The probability of P_or_Q should be calculated as the sum of P and Q minus the probability of both occurring (P_and_Q).\n\n6. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while not P occurs?)** indicates that Q happens but P does not. This requires careful consideration since it involves both independent and dependent relationships.\n\n7. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)** is a conditional probability that can be estimated based on the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. This can be a bit tricky as it requires understanding how likely Q is when we know P is true.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these questions are pivotal in determining their probabilities.

Given his previous engagements and the significance of Bitcoin in his public persona, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.65 for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, reflecting the possibility that he may not attend.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and since it essentially asks the same thing, I will assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Considering Musk's previous engagement with Bitcoin and his tendency to make public statements, I estimate this probability to be slightly higher, around 0.75.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The probability of both events occurring is influenced by their independence. Given that both events could occur simultaneously, I estimate this probability to be 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone. I will estimate it at 0.85, considering the likelihood of at least one event happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This scenario is less likely since if Q occurs, it is probable that P may also occur. I will estimate this probability at 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This is a conditional probability that assumes P happens. Given that Musk showing up could increase the likelihood of him making a statement, I will estimate this at 0.80.\n\nI will ensure that all probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between the probabilities of P, not_P, Q, and their combinations.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0232997423584671, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.01164987117923355, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.21684543705982762, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
