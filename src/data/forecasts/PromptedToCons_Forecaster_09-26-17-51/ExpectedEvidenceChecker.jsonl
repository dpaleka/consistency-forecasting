Given Musk's previous involvement in the cryptocurrency space and the nature of the event, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for this event occurring.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Since this is the complement of P, I estimate this probability at 0.35 (1 - 0.65).\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P, and given the context, I estimate it to be the same as P, so I will assign it a probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk making a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin and the likelihood of him discussing it at some point in 2024, I estimate this probability to be 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: For this compound event, I will estimate it as the product of the individual probabilities, considering they might be somewhat independent. Therefore, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not_P occurs)**: This is a more complex event, and I will estimate it at a lower probability since it requires Musk to make a statement while not attending the conference. I will estimate this at 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P occurs)**: This conditional probability is likely to be higher than Q alone, as attending the conference may lead to more statements. I will estimate this at 0.80.\n\nOverall, these estimates are interrelated, and I will ensure they adhere to the consistency rules provided. The independence of events P and Q is assumed for the calculations, but I will check the final estimates against the consistency rules to ensure they hold true.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.46,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.90 + 0.46 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.90 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "1c0c80bf-e8ef-4602-917d-db2226c9870e", "title": "Will Larry Elder be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his history of involvement in the cryptocurrency space, I might estimate a moderate to high probability for this event, perhaps around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is essentially similar to P, so I would expect a similar probability estimate, around 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given Musk's active presence in the cryptocurrency community, I might estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This would require both P and Q to be true. The probability of this happening would be lower than either P or Q alone, possibly around 0.42, assuming some level of independence.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This would typically be calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.70, and P_and_Q is 0.42, then P_or_Q would be 0.60 + 0.70 - 0.42 = 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This probability would be calculated by considering the likelihood of Q occurring while P does not, which could be around 0.28, assuming some independence.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This would typically be higher than the base rate of Q, possibly around 0.80, given that if Musk shows up at the conference, he is likely to make a statement about Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these probabilities need to be consistent according to the rules provided.

Given his previous involvement with Bitcoin and technology events, I would estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, say around 0.60. \n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. Given that I estimated P at 0.60, not_P would be 0.40. \n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P and should have the same probability, so I would also estimate this at 0.60. \n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of making statements about Bitcoin, I would estimate this probability at 0.70, reflecting a higher likelihood that he will engage with the topic at some point during the year. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: For this probability, I would consider the intersection of P and Q. If I estimate P at 0.60 and Q at 0.70, the joint probability would be lower than either of the individual probabilities, possibly around 0.45, reflecting that while both events are likely, they are not guaranteed to happen simultaneously. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than either individual probability. Given the estimates for P and Q, I would calculate this as P + Q - P_and_Q, leading to a value of approximately 0.85. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This is more complex. If Q is likely at 0.70, but P is at 0.60, I would estimate this probability to be lower, possibly around 0.25, as it requires that Musk speaks about Bitcoin but does not attend the event. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: If Musk shows up at the event, the likelihood of him making a public statement about Bitcoin should increase. I might estimate this at 0.80, reflecting a strong correlation between the two events.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, especially focusing on the relationships between the probabilities.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0841197911220696, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

I would estimate this probability around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is closely related to P, and I would assign it a similar probability of 0.65 since it's essentially asking if the event is possible.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's active engagement with the cryptocurrency community, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability can be estimated as the product of P and Q, assuming independence, which would be 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. If P is 0.65 and Q is 0.70, then P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This would be a more complex relationship since it combines Q with the negation of P. Given that Q has a higher probability than not_P, I would estimate this to be around 0.15.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability would likely be higher than the overall probability of Q since showing up at the conference may lead to a higher chance of making a public statement. I would estimate this to be around 0.80.\n\nAfter estimating these probabilities, I will check them against the consistency rules to ensure they align with the logical relationships defined. I need to ensure that the relationships between P, not_P, Q, and their combinations follow the rules of probability, such as complements, independence, and conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.46,\nP_or_Q: 0.89,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.89 + 0.46 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.89 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.89 - 0.15 is FALSE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2, failed_check_3, failed_check_4, failed_check_5 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d9e9acf1-3010-456e-894d-9d5790900033", "title": "Will Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

Given the significance of the event and Musk's previous engagements, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be approximately 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P, so I expect it to have a similar probability, likely around 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency community, I would estimate this probability to be relatively high, perhaps around 0.75.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability depends on both P and Q occurring simultaneously. Assuming some correlation between attending the event and making a statement about Bitcoin, I might estimate this around 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability would be higher than both individual probabilities since it covers both events. Using the formula for the union of two events, I can estimate this around 0.85.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This is less likely since if Musk makes a statement about Bitcoin, it could be at the Nashville event. I would estimate this probability to be lower, perhaps around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: If Musk shows up at the Nashville event, the likelihood of him making a public statement about Bitcoin increases. Thus, I might estimate this probability to be higher, around 0.80.\n\nAfter estimating these probabilities, I will need to check against the consistency rules to ensure that they are logically coherent.

Given his past involvement in Bitcoin discussions, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 0.35 based on the estimate of P.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I expect it to have a similar probability, also around 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin and the likelihood of him discussing it at various events, I estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: The probability of both events happening simultaneously would be lower than either event alone. I estimate this at 0.45, considering some independence but also recognizing that if he shows up, he is likely to make a statement.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either individual event. I estimate this at 0.80, considering the likelihood of at least one of these events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This scenario is possible if Musk makes a public statement but does not attend the event.

Given his prominence in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate to high probability that he will attend.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. Since I have assigned a probability to P, I will derive not_P as 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P. If there is a reasonable chance that he will show up, then it is also plausible that he could attend. Thus, I would assign a similar probability to para_P as to P.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of making public statements about Bitcoin and his active involvement in the cryptocurrency community, I would assign a moderate probability to this question as well.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This event requires both P and Q to happen. I will calculate this probability based on the individual probabilities of P and Q, taking into account their potential correlation.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is a logical OR between P and Q. I will calculate this probability using the probabilities of P, Q, and P_and_Q, ensuring that it aligns with the logical relationship.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This event requires that Q happens while P does not. I will consider the probabilities accordingly, as the occurrence of Q does not necessarily depend on P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability assesses whether Q is likely to occur if P is true. I will evaluate this based on the historical context of Musk's actions when he has attended events.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities assigned respect the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between the events, such as complements, conjunctions, and disjunctions.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.90 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.90 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
