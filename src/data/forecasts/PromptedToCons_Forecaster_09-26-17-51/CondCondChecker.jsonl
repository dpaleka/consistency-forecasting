Given his previous involvement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending the event, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially asking if the event is feasible for him to attend. Given that he is a public figure and the event is significant within the Bitcoin community, I would estimate this at 0.60 as well, aligning with P.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: This is a broader question and could happen independently of his attendance at the Nashville event. Given his past statements on Bitcoin, I would estimate this at around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This would depend on the likelihood of both events happening together. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.70, I would estimate P_and_Q at 0.42, considering some overlap in the events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This is a union of the two probabilities. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.70, the formula for P_or_Q would be P + Q - P_and_Q, leading to an estimate of 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs but P does not)**: This would require Q to happen while P does not. This is slightly more complex as it would involve estimating the independence of the two events. I would estimate this at 0.28, assuming a fair chance of Q occurring without P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: This conditional probability will be higher since if Musk attends the event, the likelihood of him making a statement about Bitcoin increases. I would estimate this at around 0.80.\n\nOverall, I believe these estimates fit within the framework of the consistency rules provided. The relationships between the events are closely tied, particularly between P and Q, as they can influence each other.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.88 + 0.42 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.88 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.88 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "6abad6bc-ea65-4bc9-a192-1cfc315981dc", "title": "Given Czechia qualifies for the Grand Final, will Denmark qualify for Eurovision 2024 Grand Final?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Czechia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Factors include his interest in Bitcoin and the prominence of the event.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complementary event to P. If I predict P at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, as these two probabilities must sum to 1.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P but framed in a more general sense. I expect this to be slightly higher than P, as it doesn't require confirmation of attendance but rather considers the possibility. Thus, I might estimate this at 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of making statements about Bitcoin, I would assign a higher probability to this event, perhaps around 0.75.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: To estimate this, I consider the likelihood of both events happening together. Since both events are somewhat independent but related, I might estimate this at around 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than the individual probabilities of P and Q, as it accounts for the occurrence of either event. I would estimate this at 0.85.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and P not occur?)**: This situation would require that Musk makes a statement but does not attend the event. Given the nature of public figures, I would estimate this at around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability would likely be high, as if Musk attends the event, he may also make a statement. I might estimate this at around 0.80.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the estimates adhere to the consistency rules, particularly regarding complementary events, independent events, and conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\n{neg, andor, and, or, but, cond consistency checks passed! para consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "63427473-1143-4651-ba4b-d4a65a815705", "title": "If both Czechia and Denmark qualify for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, will Portugal also qualify?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Both Czechia and Denmark participate in their respective Semi-finals and are officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Given his past involvement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.60 that he will show up.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P should be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is somewhat similar to P but might consider a broader context. I would estimate this at 0.65, indicating a slightly higher chance due to the vagueness of \"possible.\"\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given that Elon Musk is known for making statements about Bitcoin, I estimate this probability at 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The occurrence of both events is likely but not guaranteed. Therefore, I estimate this probability at 0.42, which reflects a reasonable joint probability based on the individual estimates.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than both P and Q individually, so I estimate it at 0.80, considering that at least one of these events is likely.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This scenario is less likely since if Q occurs, it does not necessarily mean that P cannot occur.

If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Since this is essentially a rephrasing of P, I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given his previous engagements and the ongoing interest in Bitcoin, I would estimate this probability at 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability is influenced by the assumption that if he attends the conference, he is likely to make a statement about Bitcoin. I estimate this at 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This would be higher than the individual probabilities of P and Q, so I would estimate it at 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This is a bit tricky, as it requires that he makes a statement without attending the conference. I estimate this at 0.15.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will he make a public statement about Bitcoin?)**: If he shows up, the likelihood that he makes a statement increases, so I would estimate this at 0.85.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that these estimates are consistent with the consistency rules provided, adjusting as necessary.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.85 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\n{failed_check_cond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.39,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.19278770865409717, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04819692716352429, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7576068812927413, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given that I have a moderate estimate for P, I can derive not_P as its complement.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a more general question and I expect it to have a similar probability to P since it is asking if attendance is possible rather than certain.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, I estimate a relatively high probability for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This is a conjunction of the two events, which I expect to have a lower probability than either P or Q alone, as both events need to happen simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is the disjunction of the two events, and I expect this probability to be higher than either P or Q alone since it encompasses both possibilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This examines the scenario where Musk makes a public statement but does not attend the event. It is likely but lower than Q alone since it requires the negation of P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability considers the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. I expect this to be relatively high since if Musk attends, he is likely to make a public statement.\n\nIn terms of independence, P and Q are related but not independent, as Musk's attendance may influence his likelihood of making a public statement. Therefore, the probabilities must be carefully calibrated to reflect this relationship and ensure that they adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.88 + 0.42 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.88 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.88 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "056b026e-c3e3-499e-81ef-6e8799cbe391", "title": "Given Latvia qualifies for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024, will Australia qualify as well?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Latvia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

I estimate a moderate probability that he will show up, say around 0.60, considering his popularity and previous involvement in cryptocurrency events.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is similar to P, so I would estimate it around the same probability, 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's tendency to comment on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I would estimate a higher probability here, around 0.75.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This requires both P and Q to be true. If we assume P and Q are not completely independent, I would estimate this to be lower than the product of their probabilities, perhaps around 0.45.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is a broader question that could be true if either event occurs. I would estimate this to be higher than both individual probabilities, perhaps around 0.85.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while not P occurs?)**: This requires Q to be true while P is false. Given the estimates, I would assume this could be around 0.30, considering that Q can happen independent of P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: If P occurs, it might increase the likelihood of Q occurring. I would estimate this to be higher than Q alone, perhaps around 0.80.\n\nBy applying the consistency rules, I will ensure that these estimates align with the mathematical relationships defined in the rules. For example, the sum of probabilities for complementary events (P and not_P) must equal 1, and the probabilities for combined events (like P_and_Q) must adhere to the defined constraints.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "e71aaf82-c53b-4804-b1cc-4289690fa447", "title": "Given both Latvia and Australia qualify for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, will Poland also qualify?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where both Latvia and Australia have qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Given his significant involvement in the cryptocurrency space, I would estimate a moderate to high probability that he will attend, say around 0.65. \n\nFor not_P, which is the probability that he will not show up, it should be complementary to P. Therefore, not_P would be 1 - P, yielding a probability of 0.35.\n\nThe para_P question, which asks if it is possible for him to attend, would likely have a similar probability to P, since if P is true, then para_P must also be true. Thus, I would estimate para_P at 0.65.\n\nFor Q, which is about whether he will make a public statement about Bitcoin in 2024, I would consider his tendency to communicate about Bitcoin and estimate this probability at around 0.70.\n\nP_and_Q, which requires both P and Q to be true, would be the product of their individual probabilities. Assuming independence, I would estimate this at P * Q = 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\nFor P_or_Q, which covers either event happening, I can use the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q.

The probability will likely be lower due to the correlation between attendance and public statements.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability should be higher than the unconditional Q since attending the event could increase the likelihood of making a public statement.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that the estimates respect the consistency rules outlined, especially focusing on the relationships between P and not_P, as well as how P and Q interact with each other.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\n{failed_check_cond consistency check failed!}\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.67\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.12002093935849029, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03000523483962257, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7665836096459515, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
