I will assign a probability of 0.45, reflecting a reasonable chance that both will occur together. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This is a broader question than P_and_Q. I will calculate it using the formula for the union of two events: P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, it should be 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.45 = 0.90.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not_P occurs)**: This scenario reflects a situation where Musk makes a statement but does not attend the event. Given the independence of the two events, I estimate this probability to be around 0.25.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This is a conditional probability. Since P occurring could increase the likelihood of Q, I will estimate this at 0.80.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: P and Q are not completely independent, as Musk's attendance (P) could influence his likelihood of making a public statement (Q). However, they are related in a way that allows for potential overlap, reflected in the P_and_Q calculation.

However, considering that he has a busy schedule and other commitments, I would not assign a certainty. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complement of P, so it should logically follow that if P is set at a certain probability, not_P would be the remainder. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This should align closely with P, as it essentially asks the same question but in a more general sense. \n\n4. **Q (Musk making a public statement about Bitcoin)**: Given Musk's history of discussing Bitcoin and the increasing interest in the cryptocurrency, I would assign a reasonable probability to this event occurring. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: For this to happen, both events must occur simultaneously. The likelihood would be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be satisfied. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone since it accounts for the occurrence of either event. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not P)**: This is a specific scenario where Musk makes a statement but does not attend the event. This is possible but should be lower than Q alone. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given P)**: This conditional probability should be higher than Q alone because if Musk attends, he may be more likely to make a statement about Bitcoin at the event.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that the predicted probabilities adhere to the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the relationships between these events and their logical implications.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c183fd7c-acbc-4998-9fe9-3d2b1e75ade9", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?

Given his previous engagements and interest in cryptocurrencies, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at a certain probability, not_P would simply be 1 - P. The relationship is straightforward and follows the negation rule.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is essentially a rephrasing of P, so I will assign it the same probability as P. \n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's influential role in the crypto community, there is a reasonable chance he will make a public statement about Bitcoin, either at the Nashville event or elsewhere. This leads to a moderate probability.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The probability of both events happening can be estimated as the product of their individual probabilities, assuming some level of independence. However, since P and Q might not be entirely independent (if he attends the event, he may be more likely to make a statement), I will adjust this estimate accordingly.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This combines both events. The probability can be calculated using the formula for the union of two events, which is P + Q - P_and_Q. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while not P occurs?)**: This requires that Musk makes a statement but does not attend the event. The probability of this happening can be calculated based on the probabilities of Q and not_P. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q occurring if P has occurred. The probability should reflect that if Musk attends the event, he is more likely to make a statement.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these questions are interdependent, particularly between P and Q, which will affect the probabilities assigned to the combined events.

Given his public persona and past participation in similar events, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend.\n\n**not_P** (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?) is simply the complement of P, so it should be calculated as 1 - P. This relationship is straightforward and obeys the consistency rule.\n\n**para_P** (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?) is related to P and should have a similar probability since if he shows up, it is inherently possible. Thus, I expect this probability to be slightly higher than P.\n\n**Q** (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?) is independent of P; however, it is still relevant. There is a reasonable chance he will make such a statement given his active involvement in the cryptocurrency space, so I assign a moderate probability.\n\n**P_and_Q** (Will both P and Q occur?) depends on both events happening simultaneously. This probability should be lower than either P or Q individually, as both must occur for this to resolve positively.\n\n**P_or_Q** (Will either P or Q occur?) should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses both events happening. However, if one event has a high probability and the other a low one, it can affect this estimate.\n\n**Q_and_not_P** (Will both Q occur and not P?) requires that Q happens while P does not.

Given Musk's history with Bitcoin and his public persona, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, perhaps around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 0.35, assuming the estimates are consistent.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and since it is asking if it is possible, I would predict a slightly higher probability, perhaps around 0.70, as it implies a general openness to the idea without the constraints of a specific commitment.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin in the past, I would estimate this to be around 0.75.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This is the intersection of P and Q. Given the probabilities of P and Q, I would estimate this at around 0.50, reflecting that while both events could occur, they are not guaranteed to happen together.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This includes scenarios where either event happens. I would estimate this at around 0.85, reflecting a high likelihood that at least one of the two events will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This represents the scenario where Musk makes a statement about Bitcoin but does not attend the conference. I would estimate this at around 0.20, as it is plausible but less likely than both events occurring together.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability would likely be higher than Q alone, perhaps around 0.80, as attending the conference could increase the likelihood of making a public statement about Bitcoin.\n\nIn summary, the estimates are interrelated, and I will ensure that they adhere to the consistency rules to maintain logical coherence among the probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\n{failed_check_para}\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "4ca6af27-3444-456a-a3dc-869877bc499a", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, and (2) Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

Given these factors, I would estimate a moderate to high probability, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a more general question than P, so I would assign it a similar probability, around 0.65. \n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's influence and past statements about Bitcoin, I would estimate a moderate probability for this as well, perhaps around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability is likely lower than either P or Q individually, as it requires both events to happen. I would estimate this at around 0.45.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone. Using the formula for the union of two events, I would estimate this to be around 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This is a more specific scenario and would likely have a lower probability than either Q or not_P alone. I would estimate this at around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability should be higher than the unconditional probability of Q, as P may influence Q positively. I would estimate this at around 0.75.\n\nIn summary, I will use these estimates to check for consistency against the provided rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.05344546699179087, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.01781515566393029, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3507323215972475, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
