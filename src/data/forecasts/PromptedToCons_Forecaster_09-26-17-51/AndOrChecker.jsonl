Given his historical engagement with the Bitcoin community, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P, and thus its probability will be derived from my estimate of P. If P is high, not_P will be lower.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I expect it to have a similar probability since they are asking about the same event. \n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given Musk's history of making statements about Bitcoin, I believe there is a reasonable probability that he will do so at some point in 2024.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability will depend on the interaction between P and Q. If both events are likely but not guaranteed, this probability will be lower than either P or Q alone.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability should be higher than both P and Q individually since it captures the occurrence of either event.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This scenario is plausible if Musk makes a statement but does not attend the Nashville event. The probability here will depend on the independence of the two events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given that P occurs)**: This conditional probability should be relatively high if I believe that Musk is more likely to make a statement if he attends the event.\n\n### Consistency Rules:\n- The predictions must adhere to the consistency rules provided. For example, the sum of probabilities for P and not_P must equal 1. Similarly, for P_and_Q, it must be less than or equal to both P and Q, and the calculations for P_or_Q and Q_and_not_P must also be consistent with the respective probabilities.\n\n### Independence:\n- I consider that P and Q may have some level of independence, but they are not entirely independent since attending the event could influence whether Musk makes a statement about Bitcoin. Therefore, the probabilities will reflect this relationship.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e182acfe-2dea-425f-afca-37a2fe27e1c8", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his past involvement in cryptocurrency discussions, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P. If P is high, not_P will naturally be lower. I will set this to be the complement of P.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is similar to P, and since it asks if it is possible, I expect it to have a similar probability to P.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Considering Musk's history of making statements about Bitcoin, I expect this probability to be reasonably high as well, perhaps slightly higher than P due to the broader scope of events he could attend.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability is dependent on both P and Q occurring simultaneously. Given that these two events can influence each other, I would expect this probability to be lower than either P or Q alone but still significant.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q since it accounts for the occurrence of either event. I would expect this to be close to the sum of P and Q, minus the overlap accounted for in P_and_Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not_P occurs)**: This scenario is interesting as it assumes Musk makes a statement about Bitcoin without attending the conference. This is plausible, and I would assign it a moderate probability.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability would likely be high, as attending the conference could increase the chances of making a public statement about Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, Q, and their combinations.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.67\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "36df8d04-52df-436e-8ae9-f5feb2ca6aa2", "title": "Will both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson be selected as the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson are selected by the Republican National Convention as nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his prominence in the crypto space, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **Event not_P** (Elon Musk does not show up): This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P, which would be 0.40.\n\n3. **Event para_P** (It is possible that Elon Musk will attend): This is closely related to P and would have a similar probability, potentially around 0.60 as well.\n\n4. **Event Q** (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin in 2024): Given Musk's history of engaging with Bitcoin and the likelihood of him making statements at various events, I would estimate this probability to be higher, around 0.75.\n\n5. **Event P_and_Q** (Both P and Q occur): This event requires both conditions to be true. Given the estimated probabilities, I might estimate this to be around 0.45, as both events are somewhat independent but positively correlated.\n\n6. **Event P_or_Q** (Either P or Q occurs): This probability would be higher than either individual event due to their potential overlap, so I would estimate it at around 0.85.\n\n7. **Event Q_and_not_P** (Q occurs while P does not): This event would be less likely than Q alone since it requires that Musk makes a statement but does not attend the conference. I might estimate this at around 0.20.\n\n8. **Event Q_given_P** (Given P occurs, will Q occur?): If Musk shows up at the conference, the likelihood of him making a statement about Bitcoin is likely higher, so I would estimate this probability at around 0.80.\n\nOverall, I would ensure that the estimated probabilities are consistent with the rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between the events and their complements.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.75 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0013545618758216693, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00033864046895541733, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.05202972787326808, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Since P and Q are not entirely independent (Musk's attendance could influence his statements), I might estimate this around 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is a union of the two events, and given that both have a decent probability of occurring, I would estimate this to be around 0.85.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This question combines Q with the negation of P. It\u2019s plausible that Musk could make a statement without attending, but less likely than both occurring, so I might estimate this at 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: If Musk shows up at the conference, the likelihood of him making a statement about Bitcoin increases. Thus, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.80. \n\nIn summary, I have considered the interdependencies between these questions, especially how P and Q influence each other.

Given his influence in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)** - This is the complement of P. If I predict a certain probability for P, then not_P will naturally be 1 minus that probability.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)** - This question is closely related to P, and I expect the probability to be roughly the same, as it essentially asks about the same event but in a more general sense.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)** - This prediction will depend on his engagement with Bitcoin throughout the year. Given his history of making statements about Bitcoin, I anticipate a reasonable probability of him making such statements.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both occur: Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and makes a public statement about Bitcoin in 2024?)** - The probability of both events happening is likely to be lower than either event happening individually, as they are not guaranteed to coincide.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either occur: Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or makes a public statement about Bitcoin in 2024?)** - This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it includes the possibility of one or both events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both occur: Elon Musk makes a statement about Bitcoin and does not show up at the Nashville 2024?)** - This considers the scenario where he makes a statement but does not attend, which could be plausible given the timing of events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will he make a public statement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)** - This conditional probability should be high, as his attendance at the event may increase the likelihood of him making a public statement about Bitcoin. \n\nIn summary, I expect these events to be interrelated, with P and Q influencing each other. The probabilities will be adjusted to ensure consistency with the rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "c03a45a3-8db7-45df-b328-3c3e44992ea7", "title": "Will either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Assuming independence, Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.70 * 0.40 = 0.28.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This is a conditional probability. If P occurs, it might increase the likelihood of Q, so I would estimate this at 0.80.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities are interrelated, and I have ensured that they comply with the consistency rules.
