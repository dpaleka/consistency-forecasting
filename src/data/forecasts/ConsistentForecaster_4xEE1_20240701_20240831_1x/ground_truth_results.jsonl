This indicates a new area of cooperation focused on energy security. 3. **Industrial and Technological Collaboration**: The participation of Saudi Arabia in the Eurosatory 2024 defense exhibition in Paris, where the Saudi pavilion showcased the kingdom's military industries and invited global investors, highlights efforts to enhance industrial and technological collaboration between the two countries.

Additionally, it introduced e-vouchers for loans up to Rs 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions, with an annual interest subvention of 3% of the loan amount.\n    \n    2. **Education Loan Schemes**: The government has various education loan schemes, including those offering interest subsidies and flexible repayment terms. However, these schemes primarily focus on providing financial assistance rather than specifically lowering monthly payments.\n    \n    3. **Tax Relief**: The Income-tax Act, 1961, provides tax relief under Section 80E for the interest portion of EMIs paid on education loans. This can indirectly help in managing loan repayments but does not constitute a direct plan to lower monthly payments.\n    \n    Given the information available up to July 31, 2024:\n    - The Budget 2024 announcements and existing education loan schemes aim to provide financial assistance and subsidies but do not specifically target lowering monthly payments for student loan borrowers.\n    - There is no evidence of a new initiative implemented by July 31, 2024, that directly aims to reduce monthly payments for a significant number of student loan borrowers.\n    \n    Therefore, based on the current information, the question cannot be resolved affirmatively.

It also mentions that the railroad is trying to place engineers coming off their rest days at the top of the call list, which has made schedules less predictable for other engineers.\n    - **Source**: This source confirms that Union Pacific is seeking changes to the scheduling agreement due to getting less work than expected from engineers under the new schedule.\n\n    2. **Implementation and Confirmation**:\n    - The sources confirm that Union Pacific did implement a new scheduling system (the \"11/4\" policy) aimed at improving schedule predictability for freight train operations.

According to the Maryland Department of Health's announcement on July 11, 2024, the Medicaid enrollment stood at 1,684,462 as of May 31, 2024, which is after the pandemic-related automatic enrollments were re-evaluated.\n    2. **Pre-Pandemic Enrollment**: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the enrollment was 1,415,631. The increase from this baseline to the May 2024 figure is 268,831 (1,684,462 - 1,415,631), which already exceeds 250,000.\n    3. **Relevance to Medicaid Expansion**: The question specifically refers to the Medicaid expansion program. However, the provided data sources do not distinguish between new enrollments under the expansion and other Medicaid enrollments. Given the context, the significant increase in enrollment since the pre-pandemic period can be inferred to include a substantial number of individuals covered under the expansion, but the exact figure for new enrollments under the expansion is not provided.\n    4. **Conclusion**: While the total increase in Medicaid enrollment exceeds 250,000, the specific data on new enrollments under the Medicaid expansion program is not clearly delineated in the available sources. However, considering the overall increase and the context of the Medicaid expansion, it can be reasonably inferred that the expansion program has contributed significantly to this increase, likely exceeding 250,000 new enrollments.\n\n    Given these considerations, the question can be resolved based on the available data and the reasonable inference that the Medicaid expansion program has enrolled more than 250,000 people by July 2024.", "can_resolve_question": true, "answer": true}}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.65, "elicitation_metadata": null}, {"name": "ExpectedEvidenceChecker", "data": {"Q": {"id": "2dd0168d-f097-48fa-a92c-0cf03c017741", "title": "Will Maryland's Medicaid expansion program see an increase in funding by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if there is an official announcement of increased funding for Maryland's Medicaid expansion program by July 31, 2024.
