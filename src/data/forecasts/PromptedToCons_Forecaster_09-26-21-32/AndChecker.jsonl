I might assign a moderate probability (e.g., 0.65) based on current political sentiment and data trends.\n\n2. **not_P (Kamala's odds of winning not increase)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be calculated as 1 - P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Likelihood of winning improves)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would assign it the same probability (0.65).\n\n4. **Q (Kamala's approval rating increase)**: I will assess the probability of her approval rating increasing based on major polls. This might also be set at a moderate level (e.g., 0.60) based on current approval ratings.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability would be determined by the joint occurrence of both events. If both P and Q are moderately likely, I might estimate this as the product of their probabilities, adjusted for any correlation.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This would be calculated based on the probabilities of P and Q, ensuring to account for their intersection.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This would require assessing the likelihood of Q occurring while P does not, which might be lower than the individual probabilities due to the relationship between approval ratings and election odds.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This conditional probability would reflect the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. I would need to assess whether an increase in odds correlates with an increase in approval rating.\n\nThroughout this process, I will ensure that the consistency rules are adhered to. For instance, I will check the relationships between P and not_P, P_and_Q and P_or_Q, and so on. If any inconsistencies arise, I will adjust the probabilities accordingly to maintain logical coherence.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.39,\nP_or_Q: 0.86,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.86 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.86 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.86 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.36,\nP_or_Q: 0.84,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.19,\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e6e128a8-5942-4828-91aa-bd358fc1c8af", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

If we estimate P (the probability that Kamala's odds of winning increase) at a certain value, not_P should be the complement of that value. This relationship is governed by the negation rule, which states that P + not_P must equal 1.\n\n2. **para_P**: This question is essentially the same as P. Therefore, its probability should match that of P. This is a straightforward application of the parallel rule, which states that para_P should equal P.\n\n3. **Q**: This question is independent of P and not_P. The probability of Q (the approval rating increasing) can be estimated separately based on historical data or polling trends. However, we should ensure that Q does not conflict with the other probabilities.\n\n4. **P_and_Q**: This question requires both P and Q to be true. The probability of this occurring can be calculated using the multiplication rule for independent events, but if P and Q are not independent, we need to adjust accordingly. The probability of P_and_Q should be less than or equal to the probabilities of P and Q individually.\n\n5. **P_or_Q**: This question resolves positively if either P or Q is true. The probability of P_or_Q should be calculated using the addition rule, ensuring it respects the boundaries set by P and Q.\n\n6. **Q_and_not_P**: This question requires Q to be true while P is false. The probability of this scenario must respect the conditions set by the probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n7. **Q_given_P**: This is a conditional probability, which depends on the relationship between P and Q. We must ensure that the probability of Q given P aligns with the overall estimates and respects the conditional probability rules.\n\nIn summary, I will estimate each probability while ensuring that they comply with the consistency rules provided. The relationships between the questions will guide the estimates, particularly focusing on the negation, parallel, and conditional relationships.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.35,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.35 - 0.55 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.35 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.35 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\n{failed_check_cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.32,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "89c018df-ebc9-43ed-9da9-711efaaaaeb7", "title": "Will both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson are selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Let's analyze and predict the probabilities for each question:\n\n1. **P (Kamala's odds of winning increase)**: This is likely influenced by various factors, including polling data and political climate. Given the context of an upcoming election and the volatility of public opinion, I might estimate this probability at around 0.60, assuming a moderate chance of improvement.\n\n2. **not_P (Kamala's odds of winning not increase)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. However, I need to ensure that this aligns with other probabilities, especially those involving conditional relationships.\n\n3. **para_P (Likelihood of Kamala winning improve)**: Since para_P is essentially the same as P, I would keep this at 0.60 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Kamala Harris's approval rating increase)**: Given the context of polls and potential media coverage, I might estimate this probability at around 0.55, reflecting a slightly better than even chance of an increase in approval ratings.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability is dependent on both P and Q being true. Assuming P and Q are somewhat independent, I can estimate this as P * Q = 0.60 * 0.55 = 0.33.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.55 - 0.33 = 0.82.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This probability would depend on the likelihood of Q occurring while P does not.

The key variables include:\n\n1. **P**: Represents the probability that Kamala's odds of winning will increase according to Nate Silver's model. This is a binary question that hinges on whether the Electoral College probability exceeds 46.6%.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complement of P, indicating that her odds will not increase, which means the probability will be 46.6% or lower.\n\n3. **para_P**: This is essentially a rephrasing of P, asking if the likelihood of winning improves, and thus should have the same probability as P.\n\n4. **Q**: This question focuses on whether Kamala Harris's approval rating will increase according to major polls, specifically if it exceeds 50%.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question is a conjunction of P and Q, meaning both conditions must be true for this to resolve positively. The probability here should reflect the joint probability of both events occurring.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This is a disjunction of P and Q, meaning if either P or Q is true, this resolves positively. The probability should reflect the likelihood of at least one of these events occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question checks if Q is true while P is false, meaning her approval rating increases while her odds of winning do not increase.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This question looks at the conditional probability of Q given that P is true, assessing whether an increase in her odds correlates with an increase in approval ratings.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: \n- P and Q are independent events; changes in one do not directly affect the other, but they can influence the joint probabilities in P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P.\n- The relationships between these probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules provided, ensuring that the mathematical relationships hold true across the various questions. For example, not_P must equal 1 - P, and P_and_Q must be constrained by the probabilities of P and Q.\n\nOverall, the estimates will need to be carefully considered to ensure they respect the consistency rules while reflecting the uncertainty regarding Kamala Harris's political prospects.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.33,\nP_or_Q: 0.82,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.22,\nQ_given_P: 0.52\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.82 + 0.33 - 0.55 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.33 <= min(0.60, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.55) <= 0.82 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.55) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.82 - 0.22 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.33 / 0.52 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nandor, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.22,\nQ_given_P: 0.52\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "dbd16036-0107-4e19-bcff-49cdb621344b", "title": "Will Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

Given the current political climate and polling data, I estimate this probability to be moderately high, around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary question to P, estimating the probability that her odds will not increase. This should be the complement of P, so I estimate this at 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P but uses different wording. Given that it essentially asks the same thing, I would assign it a similar probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q**: This question asks if Kamala Harris's approval rating will increase. Given the current approval trends, I estimate this probability to be around 0.55.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question asks if both P and Q will occur. Since both probabilities are moderately high, I can estimate this using the formula for the intersection of two independent events. I would estimate this at around 0.35.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This question asks if either P or Q will occur. Given that both are likely, I can estimate this using the formula for the union of two events, leading to an estimate of around 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question asks if Q occurs while P does not. Given the probabilities of Q and not_P, I would estimate this to be around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional question asks if Q occurs given that P has occurred. If P is true, it might influence Q positively, so I would estimate this to be higher than Q alone, around 0.65.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these questions are interdependent, especially between P, not_P, Q, and their combinations. I will ensure that the final probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.35,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.35 - 0.55 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.35 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.35 / 0.65 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "448c8eee-e5cb-4209-907e-0f29a395452b", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President, and (2) Kamala Harris's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "(1) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nThis resolves Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.\n\nTo qualify for a Yes resolution, the statement must be unambiguous and conclusive: it should leave no room for the possibility that Biden would accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nIf such a definitive statement is not made prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, this question will resolve as No.\n\n(2) Will Kamala Harris's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?\n\nThis resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday, August 9th, at 8:40 PM.

Given that the question specifies a threshold of 46.6%, I would estimate the probability of this happening based on current trends and historical data.\n\n2. **not_P (Kamala's odds of winning not increase)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P to be a certain value, not_P will be 1 minus that value. This relationship is straightforward and must adhere to the consistency rules.\n\n3. **para_P (Likelihood of Kamala winning improve)**: This question is similar to P, and I would expect it to have a similar probability estimate as it essentially asks the same thing using different wording. \n\n4. **Q (Kamala Harris's approval rating increase)**: This prediction will depend on current polling data and public sentiment towards Kamala Harris. If recent polls indicate a positive trend, I would assign a higher probability to this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: The probability of both events occurring would be influenced by the individual probabilities of P and Q. If both are likely, then P_and_Q should also be relatively high, but it cannot exceed the individual probabilities of P or Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This will be the sum of the probabilities of P and Q minus the probability of P_and_Q, in accordance with the rules of probability. This value should be carefully calculated to ensure it does not exceed 1.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This situation requires that Q is true while P is false. The probability of this event will depend on the individual probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P is true)**: This conditional probability will be influenced by how likely Q is when P is true. If there is a strong correlation between P and Q, this probability will be higher.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: P and Q are related but not necessarily independent. The outcome of one may influence the other, particularly in a political context where approval ratings can affect election odds. Therefore, I will ensure that my estimates reflect these relationships and adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.33,\nP_or_Q: 0.82,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.22,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.82 + 0.33 - 0.55 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.33 <= min(0.60, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.55) <= 0.82 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.82 - 0.22 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.33 / 0.50 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.33,\nP_or_Q: 0.82,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.22,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
