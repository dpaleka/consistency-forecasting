These events are binary and can be analyzed in terms of their probabilities and their relationships to each other.\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: I will estimate this probability based on factors such as Musk's past attendance at similar events and his current commitments. Given his prominence in the tech space and the unpredictability of his schedule, I might assign a moderate probability (e.g., 0.60) to him not showing up.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Elon Musk's absence)**: This probability should align closely with P since it essentially asks the same question in a different wording. Therefore, I would expect para_P to also be around 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Mars having a population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This is a more complex question, relying on projections of space colonization efforts. Given the current state of technology and interest in Mars, I might estimate this at a lower probability (e.g., 0.30).\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability needs to consider the independence of P and Q. If we assume they are independent, we can multiply their probabilities. For example, if P is 0.60 and Q is 0.30, then P_and_Q would be 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.30, then P_or_Q would be 0.60 + 0.30 - 0.18 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars having a population of 10,000 while Musk shows up)**: This event is dependent on both Q and not_P. If we assume independence, it would be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.30 * 0.40 = 0.12.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk does not show up, will Mars have a population of 10,000)**: This conditional probability would likely be similar to Q, as the two events do not directly influence each other. Therefore, I might keep this at around 0.30.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules provided, ensuring that they reflect the logical relationships between the events. For example, the sum of P and not_P must equal 1, and the calculations for the combined probabilities (like P_and_Q and P_or_Q) must also align with the rules.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.45, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T02:30:52.050161", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('0b18eb5b-867e-4849-b693-3fa21f706a4f'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7bc51cad-da39-4a3e-8c5e-2ae542e4757a'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('516b490c-a21b-461b-aa94-a16add505b6f'), title='Is it possible that Elon Musk will be absent from the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk fails to appear as a speaker on the main stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('b28661bd-26fb-4a4e-9bfa-1eb48de6ddf3'), title='Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nMars is often disussed as a target for mass colonization and eventual terraforming, notably by SpaceX.

Given Musk's prominence in the cryptocurrency space, there is a reasonable probability that he may not attend, but it is equally plausible that he could. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at a certain probability, not_P must equal 1 - P. This relationship is straightforward and will automatically obey the consistency rules if P is correctly estimated.\n\n3. **para_P (Elon Musk's absence)**: This is essentially a rephrasing of P and should have the same probability estimate. Thus, it will follow the same reasoning.\n\n4. **Q (Mars population before Moon)**: This event is more speculative and involves numerous factors, including advancements in space travel and colonization. Given the current state of technology and interest in Mars, I estimate a moderate probability that Mars could achieve this population before the Moon does.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring is dependent on the individual probabilities of P and Q. If both events are somewhat independent, I can use the product of their probabilities. However, if they are not independent, I will need to adjust this estimate accordingly.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability will be calculated based on the individual probabilities of P and Q, adjusted for their potential overlap (i.e., P_and_Q).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars population before Moon and Musk showing up)**: Similar to P_and_Q, this probability depends on the relationship between these two events. If there's no direct correlation, I can calculate it independently.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk does not show up, will Mars have a population of 10,000?)**: This is a conditional probability that requires understanding how the absence of Musk might influence the colonization of Mars. If I believe that Musk's attendance has little bearing on Mars colonization, I would estimate this probability based on the independent likelihood of Q.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that all probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, para_P, Q, and their combinations. I will also be careful to check for independence or correlation between the two main events (Musk's attendance and Mars colonization) as they could influence each other's probabilities.\n\nP: 0.45,\nnot_P: 0.55,\npara_P: 0.45,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.14,\nP_or_Q: 0.61,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.45 = 1 - 0.55 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.45 = 0.61 + 0.14 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.45 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.14 <= min(0.45, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.45, 0.30) <= 0.61 <= min(1, 0.45 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.45 = 0.61 - 0.16 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.45 \u2248 0.14 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.45 = 0.45 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.45,\nnot_P: 0.55,\npara_P: 0.45,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.62,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.45", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0025609722135833124, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0012804861067916562, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07153815252817429, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his history with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, I might estimate a moderate probability that he will not show up, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This is the complementary event to P, so it should be 1 - P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P**: This is essentially the same question as P, so it should share the same probability, which I would set at 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This is a more speculative question. Given the current state of space exploration, I would estimate a low probability, perhaps around 0.20, due to the significant technological and logistical challenges involved.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This event will only occur if both P and Q are true. Assuming independence for simplicity, I would estimate this as P * Q = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event will occur if either P or Q is true. Using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, I would calculate this as 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This would occur if Q is true and P is false. Assuming independence again, I would estimate this as Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This is a conditional probability. Given that Musk does not show up, the probability of Mars having a population of 10,000 might not change significantly, so I would estimate this to still be around 0.20.\n\nOverall, the estimates need to be consistent with each other and follow the rules of probability. I will ensure that the probabilities add up correctly and that the relationships between the events are logical.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "952c295b-bf5e-4aeb-8cb7-5b6c5ccab7d0", "title": "Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T05:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T02:30:54.925359", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('0b18eb5b-867e-4849-b693-3fa21f706a4f'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7bc51cad-da39-4a3e-8c5e-2ae542e4757a'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('516b490c-a21b-461b-aa94-a16add505b6f'), title='Is it possible that Elon Musk will be absent from the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk fails to appear as a speaker on the main stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('b28661bd-26fb-4a4e-9bfa-1eb48de6ddf3'), title='Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nMars is often disussed as a target for mass colonization and eventual terraforming, notably by SpaceX.

Given Musk's previous engagements and the popularity of Bitcoin events, I might estimate a moderate probability of him not attending, perhaps around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This is the direct opposite of P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40, reflecting the chance that Musk will indeed show up.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of absence)**: This is closely related to P and should align with it. If P is 0.60, para_P can be set to the same value (0.60) as they conceptually represent the same event in different wording.\n\n4. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This question involves long-term projections about space colonization. Given the current technological and logistical challenges, I might estimate this at a lower probability, perhaps around 0.30.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: For this to be true, both P and Q must occur. If I estimate P at 0.60 and Q at 0.30, I would calculate P_and_Q as P multiplied by Q, giving an estimated value of 0.18.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is the sum of the probabilities minus the overlap. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.30, then P_or_Q would be calculated as 0.60 + 0.30 - 0.18, resulting in an estimated value of 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars has a population before Musk shows up)**: This combines Q with the negation of P. If Q is 0.30 and not_P is 0.40, I would estimate this at 0.12.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk does not show, will Mars have a population)**: This is a conditional probability. If I assume that Musk's absence has no effect on Mars's colonization, I might estimate this at 0.30, the same as Q.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that all estimates are consistent with the defined relationships and probabilities. I will also check that the estimates respect the consistency rules outlined, such as negation, conjunction, and disjunction.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.040821994520255034, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.020410997260127517, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28837490036423613, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
