Factors influencing this include his busy schedule and potential conflicts with other commitments. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P**: This question essentially rephrases P; thus, I would expect it to have a similar probability to P, assuming no new information is provided. \n\n4. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: Given the current state of space exploration and the ambitious plans by SpaceX, I believe there is a reasonable chance of Mars achieving this before the Moon does. I estimate this probability at around 0.40. \n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to occur. Given that the events may be somewhat independent, I would estimate this probability by multiplying the probabilities of P and Q, adjusted for any correlation. \n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event is satisfied if either P or Q occurs. The probability can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to occur while P does not. I would estimate this as being less likely than P_and_Q since it involves a specific combination of events. \n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This is a conditional probability asking if Mars will have a population of 10,000 given that Musk does not show up. I would estimate this to be higher than Q alone since Musk's absence could lead to more focus on Mars colonization efforts. \n\nOverall, the relationships between these events suggest that while P and Q are independent, the conditional probabilities and combinations will need careful consideration to ensure they adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "120265f1-4a48-4515-aa0d-a83eb05fb94a", "title": "If Joe Biden announces he will not accept the Democratic nomination, will Kamala Harris's odds of winning increase according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President.

Given the independent nature of these two events, the probability will be calculated based on the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q** (Either P or Q occurring): This event will also be calculated based on the probabilities of P and Q, ensuring that I account for the overlap where both events could occur simultaneously.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P** (Mars having a population before Musk shows up): This event requires both conditions to be true. The probability will be derived similarly to P_and_Q.\n\n8. **Q_given_P** (Given Musk does not show up, will Mars have a population of 10,000): This is a conditional probability that requires an assessment of how the absence of Musk affects the likelihood of Mars reaching its population goal. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that all estimates align with the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on how the probabilities interact and complement each other.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.65 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.65 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.65 - 0.14 is FALSE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.38 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, but, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.73,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c183fd7c-acbc-4998-9fe9-3d2b1e75ade9", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?

The probability could be influenced by his schedule, priorities, and the nature of the event itself. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This would be the complement of P, and thus I would expect it to be 1 - P. \n\n3. **para_P (Elon Musk's absence)**: This question essentially overlaps with P, so I would assign it a similar probability. \n\n4. **Q (Mars population vs. Moon population)**: The question of whether Mars will have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does is speculative but could be influenced by advancements in space exploration and colonization efforts by companies like SpaceX. I would assign a lower probability to this event as it is more uncertain. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This is a conjunction of P and Q, and I would expect this probability to be lower than either individual probability due to the nature of conjunctions. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This would be higher than either P or Q individually since it captures the possibility of either event happening. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars population with Musk's attendance)**: This is a conjunction of Q and not_P, and I would expect this to be low because if Musk shows up, it could imply less likelihood of Mars achieving its population target soon. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Mars population given Musk's absence)**: This conditional probability would reflect the likelihood of Mars achieving its population target in the absence of Musk, which could be higher than the unconditional probability of Q due to less distraction from events on Earth.\n\nOverall, I expect the probabilities to reflect the interdependencies of these events, ensuring they adhere to the consistency rules provided.

Therefore, if I estimate a high probability for P, it must correspondingly lower for not_P. I will likely consider the current public sentiment and prior attendance of Musk at similar events.\n\n2. **para_P** is a paraphrased version of P, so it should have the same probability as P, thus ensuring consistency.\n\n3. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)** is independent of P and not_P. The likelihood of this event will depend on various factors such as advancements in space travel and colonization efforts by entities like SpaceX.\n\n4. **P_and_Q** represents the conjunction of both events occurring. Since P and Q can be independent, I will calculate this probability based on their individual probabilities, ensuring it does not exceed the individual probabilities of P or Q.\n\n5. **P_or_Q** should reflect the probability of either event occurring. It will be calculated based on the probabilities of P and Q while adhering to the rules of probability.\n\n6. **Q_and_not_P** combines the occurrence of Q with the negation of P, which may also be independent. The probability will be derived from the individual probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n7. **Q_given_P** is a conditional probability that will depend on the likelihood of Q occurring given that P has occurred. This will require careful estimation based on the assumptions made about the relationship between these two events.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that my estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the complementary nature of P and not_P, and the relationships between the other events.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.38 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "255faa5e-074d-48bc-b577-e0569a0649f4", "title": "Given Donald Trump is removed or blocked from a primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, will he be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, as of July 15, 2024.

However, if there is any correlation (e.g., Musk's involvement in space travel), it could adjust the estimate.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This probability can be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle. It will be higher than either individual event since it accounts for the possibility of either event occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars population before Musk showing up)**: This event relies on both Q being true and P being false. The relationship between these events can be complex, and I would estimate this probability based on the correlation between Musk's actions and the timeline of Mars colonization.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Mars population given Musk does not show up)**: This conditional probability will depend on how likely Mars colonization is regardless of Musk's appearance. If Musk not showing up does not significantly impact Mars colonization efforts, this probability may be similar to Q.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these events can introduce complexity into the probability estimates, particularly regarding independence and conditional probabilities. I will ensure that the estimates adhere to the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "4ca6af27-3444-456a-a3dc-869877bc499a", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, and (2) Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

These events are independent of each other, meaning the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: Given Elon Musk's previous engagements and the nature of public appearances, I estimate a moderate probability that he will not show up at the conference.

Thus, it will have the same probability as P.\n\n4. **Q (Mars having a population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This is a more speculative event, and given the current state of space exploration and colonization efforts, I assign a lower probability to this event occurring in the near future. Factors like technological advancements, funding, and the feasibility of Mars colonization play a crucial role in this estimate.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring will be the product of their individual probabilities since they are independent. This will yield a lower probability than either event occurring alone.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is calculated by the formula P + Q - P_and_Q, ensuring that we account for the overlap between the two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars having a population of 10,000 while Musk shows up)**: This is calculated similarly to P_and_Q but involves the complement of P. The probability will be influenced by both events being independent yet needing to satisfy the conditions of both.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Mars population given Musk does not show up)**: This conditional probability considers the scenario where Musk does not show up and assesses the likelihood of Mars achieving the population threshold in that context.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are governed by their independence, and the predictions will be structured to respect the consistency rules, ensuring that the probabilities align correctly with the logical relationships defined.\n\nP: 0.45,\nnot_P: 0.55,\npara_P: 0.45,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.09,\nP_or_Q: 0.66,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.11,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.45 = 1 - 0.55 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.45 = 0.66 + 0.09 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.45 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.09 <= min(0.45, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.45, 0.20) <= 0.66 <= min(1, 0.45 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.45 = 0.66 - 0.11 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.45 \u2248 0.09 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.45 = 0.45 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.08,\nP_or_Q: 0.52,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0005228644761657362, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0001742881587219121, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.03418373378018422, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
