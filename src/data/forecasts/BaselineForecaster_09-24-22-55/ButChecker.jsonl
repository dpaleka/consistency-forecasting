The duration of the incapacity does not matter for this question. Biden exiting the office of the Presidency by death, resignation, etc., does not count. Biden invoking section 3 of the 25th amendment does not count.\n\nContext: GOP lawmaker asks Merrick Garland to invoke 25th Amendment to remove Biden from office.\n\n(b) At least 20 House or Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early. This occurs if a public letter opposing the early nomination plan is signed by at least 20 House Members or Senators who caucus with the Democratic Party before the market closes at the end of Sunday, July 21st. Multiple such letters with a combined total of 20 lawmaker's signatures would also be sufficient to resolve this market to YES. If these criteria are not met by market close, this market resolves NO.\n\nContext from Politico: Dozens of House Democrats are organizing a plan to speak out against their own party\u2019s effort to seal President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination sooner than originally planned, which they argue stifles the intense ongoing debate about his candidacy, according to a lawmaker involved in the effort. A drafted letter, circulated by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO, offers the first public signal from Democrats since the weekend\u2019s attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump that scores of their own members remain deeply unsettled about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad move by the DNC. Somebody thinks it\u2019s a clever way to lock down debate and I guess by dint of sheer force, achieve unity, but it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman said in an interview.
