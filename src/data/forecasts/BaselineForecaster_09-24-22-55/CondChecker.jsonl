(b) Will Taylor Swift cameo in Deadpool and Wolverine?", "body": "(a) Analysts are projecting a huge opening weekend for \"Deadpool x Wolverine\" crossover movie.\n\nThe film, directed by Shawn Levy and starring Ryan Reynolds, is projected to earn between $340 million and $360 million globally in its opening weekend. This would mark the biggest opening weekend ever for an R-rated movie. Domestically, the film is expected to debut with $160 million to $170 million, making it the biggest R-rated opening of all-time.\n\nThe record for biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie is the original Deadpool at $284.5M ($152.2M domestic).\n\nWill the new movie top these marks? It will probably be close...\n\nIt will certainly play at more theaters... Deadpool was a smash hit at the time, and a bit surprising.\n\nSince BoxOfficeMojo is a bit weird on reporting international opening weekends -- it provides the raw numbers but aggregates them weirdly -- we will wait for Hollywood Reporter to let us know what the weekend opening was.\n\nTo clarify on resolution...\n-> this market will resolve YES if Deadpool x Wolverine grosses more than $284.5M globally this opening weekend according to reports\n-> AND the Hollywood Reporter (or equivalent publication) reports it as the record for an R-rated movie release\n\nIn other words the BoxOfficeMojo numbers should be seen as unofficial until there's confirmation in the Hollywood press. And the number we shoot for is >$284.5M internationally... this weekend\n\n(b) Resolves YES if Taylor Swift appears in the movie in any role, even if it is just her voice used for a character.

The most recent qualifying interview was Biden's appearance on The Howard Stern Show in April, when Biden answered questions for ~70 minutes. If Biden appears in another such in-person interview for at least 45 minutes, this market resolves YES. If no qualifying interview is released before market close at the end of July, this market resolves NO. This market does not include press conferences, speeches, rallies, fundraisers, town halls, etc. It can include appearances on a podcast or late night show, or an interview edited into a show like 60 minutes. However, there must be at least 45 minutes of new footage of Biden being interviewed in-person for such appearances to count. A 50 minute video might only feature 20 minutes of video of Biden being interviewed, and so would not count. For context, Biden's interview with Stephanopoulos in July, his appearance on Jimmy Fallon in February, and his past appearances on 60 minutes have each had less than 30 minutes of video footage of Biden being interviewed. You can find a list of Biden's interviews and their transcripts here. (b) Ted Cruz will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.
