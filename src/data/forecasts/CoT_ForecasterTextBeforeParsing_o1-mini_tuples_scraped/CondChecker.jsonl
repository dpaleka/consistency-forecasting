Historically, incumbent presidents often seek re-election unless significant personal or political factors suggest otherwise.\n   - *Age and Health Considerations:* Biden was born in 1942, making him one of the oldest presidents in U.S. history. Age and health are common factors that influence decisions to run for a second term. However, without an official statement from Biden or his campaign indicating an intention not to seek re-election, it's speculative to predict his decision.\n   - *Political Climate:* The political environment leading up to the 2024 election cycle will also play a crucial role.

While he is a prominent figure in conservative media with a significant following, securing the Republican nomination typically requires an established political background and a strong campaign infrastructure. The Republican field may include candidates like former President Donald Trump, Governor Ron DeSantis, and others who have either declared their candidacy or are strong contenders with clear campaign strategies. Without a formal campaign launch or substantial backing, Carlson's chances of securing the nomination are relatively low.\n\n**(b) Republican Retention of Ohio's 6th Congressional District:**\nOhio's 6th congressional district has been a competitive seat in recent elections. The district's voting patterns can be influenced by national political trends, the candidates' appeal, and local issues. While the Republican Party may have an advantage in Ohio, retaining a specific congressional seat, especially in a special election, is not guaranteed. Special elections can be unpredictable, and factors such as voter turnout and the effectiveness of the campaign can sway the result.\n\n**Combined Probability:**\nAssuming that these two events are independent (the outcome of the presidential nomination does not directly influence the congressional seat retention and vice versa), the combined probability can be estimated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event.
