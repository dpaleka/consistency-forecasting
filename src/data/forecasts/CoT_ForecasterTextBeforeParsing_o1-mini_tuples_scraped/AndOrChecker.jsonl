As of October 2023, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has seen fluctuating territorial control. The likelihood of Russia maintaining or extending control over Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024, depends on several factors:\n- **Military Capability and Strategy:** Russia's military operations have faced significant resistance and logistical challenges. Sustained control over contested areas like Chasiv Yar requires substantial resources and strategic advantage.\n- **Ukrainian Counteroffensives:** Ukraine has been actively working to reclaim territories, and successful counteroffensives could reduce the probability of Russian control.\n- **International Support:** Continued support from Western allies to Ukraine could bolster Ukrainian efforts to counter Russian advances.\nConsidering these factors, while Russia may retain influence in certain regions, the probability of them securing and maintaining control over Chasiv Yar by the specified date is estimated to be moderate.\n\n**Event (b): Joe Biden Announces He Will Not Accept Democratic Nomination by July 15, 2024**\nAs of October 2023, Joe Biden is serving his term as President of the United States. Several considerations influence the likelihood of him deciding not to seek re-election:\n- **Age and Health:** Biden's age (he was born in 1942) and health are often cited in discussions about his potential retirement, but as of the latest information, there are no definitive public statements indicating his intention to step down.\n- **Political Landscape:** The political dynamics within the Democratic Party and his administration's performance could influence his decision. If he perceives strong support within his party, he may be more inclined to run.\n- **Personal Preference:** Ultimately, personal considerations will play a significant role, and unless Biden makes a clear indication, it's speculative to assign a high probability to his withdrawal.\nGiven the lack of definitive statements and ongoing roles, the probability of Biden announcing he will not accept the nomination by the specified date is relatively low.\n\n**Joint Probability:**\nAssuming the two events are independent, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n- Probability of (a) \u2248 0.3\n- Probability of (b) \u2248 0.2\nJoint Probability = 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06"}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "1bb145ac-e14d-4b97-8007-e89608f30eee", "title": "Will Russia control Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, or will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) When accessed by Metaculus on June 1, 2024, the [Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375) shows the coordinates 48\u00b035'13.7\"N 37\u00b050'02.1\"E as under any of the following categories:\n- Assessed Russian Advance in Ukraine\n- Assessed Russian Gains in the Past 24 Hours\n- Assessed Russian Control\n- Claimed Russian Territory in Ukraine\n- Any other categories created by ISW that indicate Russian control of the location\n\nThe question will resolve as **No** if the location is not assessed to be in any of the categories indicating Russian control, which includes but is not limited to:\n- Reported Ukrainian Territorial Gains in the Past 24 Hours\n- Claimed Ukrainian Counteroffensives\n- Reported Ukrainian Partisan Warfare\n- Any other categories created by ISW that indicate Ukrainian control of the location or a lack of Russian control of the location.\n\n(b) Prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.

Israel perceives a direct threat from Iran's potential to develop nuclear weapons and has historically employed covert operations to counteract Iran's influence and capabilities. While Israel has not engaged in open military conflict with Iran since the 1980s, the landscape remains volatile with periodic escalations and proxy confrontations in the region.\n\nSeveral factors influence the likelihood of a direct attack by Israel on Iran before May 1, 2024:\n\n1. **Nuclear Developments:** Progress or setbacks in Iran's nuclear program can impact the urgency Israel feels to act. Accelerated progress might increase the perceived need for preemptive action, while diplomatic breakthroughs could reduce immediate threats.\n\n2. **International Relations:** The stance of global powers, including the United States, European nations, and regional players like Saudi Arabia, can either deter or indirectly support such an action. Strong international condemnation could act as a deterrent.\n\n3. **Internal Politics:** Both Israeli and Iranian internal politics play a role. Leadership changes, public opinion, and political stability can influence decision-making related to military actions.\n\n4. **Military Capability and Readiness:** Israel maintains a highly capable and technologically advanced military. However, launching a significant offensive against Iran would require careful planning to avoid extensive retaliation and collateral damage.\n\n5. **Economic and Human Costs:** The potential economic repercussions and loss of life from a direct attack would be substantial, influencing the decision-making calculus.\n\nConsidering these factors, while the underlying tensions remain high and the possibility of covert operations exists, the likelihood of Israel conducting a large-scale deadly attack on Iranian soil within the specified timeframe is relatively low.

Reaching 145 JPY would represent a significant appreciation of the USD against the JPY, approximately a 10-15% increase from current levels.\n\nSeveral factors could contribute to such an appreciation:\n\n1. **Monetary Policy Divergence**: If the Federal Reserve in the United States adopts a much more aggressive interest rate hike strategy compared to the Bank of Japan, it could lead to a stronger USD as higher interest rates attract foreign investment.\n\n2. **Economic Performance**: Robust economic growth in the U.S. relative to Japan could bolster investor confidence in the USD, leading to its appreciation.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Stability**: Any geopolitical tensions or instability in the Asia-Pacific region could either strengthen or weaken the JPY, traditionally considered a safe-haven currency. However, for the USD/JPY to reach 145, the factors would need to disproportionately favor the USD.\n\n4. **Inflation Rates**: Higher inflation in Japan without corresponding measures to control it could weaken the JPY.\n\nDespite these factors, reaching 145 JPY would require sustained and significant movements in exchange rates, which are typically driven by long-term trends rather than short-term changes. Additionally, the JPY has mechanisms and market sentiments that often resist extreme fluctuations unless triggered by major economic or geopolitical events.\n\nGiven the current economic indicators and historical exchange rate movements up to October 2023, a jump to 145 JPY within the next year appears unlikely barring unforeseen major events."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "8f08f8ba-f621-4e68-b7f9-dbd2607f59f9", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat (b) USD is worth >= 145 JPY at close on August 9th, 2024?", "body": "(a) There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6.

Assuming NVDA is trading well above $100 as of October 2023, and given its market position, such a drop within approximately nine months would likely require substantial negative developments.\n\n2. US Core CPI Increasing by More Than 0.1% in July 2024:\nThe US Core CPI measures the change in the price of goods and services, excluding volatile food and energy prices. As of late 2023, inflation rates have been a key focus, with the Federal Reserve implementing measures to control inflation.\n- Monetary Policy: If the Fed continues to raise interest rates or maintains tight monetary policy, it could help keep inflation in check.\n- Supply Chain Improvements: Continued easing of supply chain constraints would likely contribute to lower price pressures.\n- Economic Growth: Slower economic growth could reduce demand-pull inflation.\nAn increase of more than 0.1% in Core CPI over a monthly period is a relatively modest change and could occur even in stable economic conditions. Given the trend towards stabilizing inflation, a monthly increase slightly above 0.1% is plausible but would depend on specific factors affecting prices in that particular month.\n\nCombined Assessment:\nGiven the individual assessments:\n- The probability of NVDA closing below $100 by July 31, 2024, appears low but not negligible, depending on unforeseen negative factors.\n- The probability of US Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024 seems reasonably plausible based on historical monthly fluctuations, assuming no drastic economic shifts.\n\nConsidering that either event would result in a YES outcome, and given that the CPI scenario is relatively plausible, the combined probability would be driven primarily by the CPI component, with the NVDA scenario adding a smaller likelihood."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.07427193467019111, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.018567983667547777, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.39394756677291937, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical polling data indicates that a lead of 2 to 4 points is within the realm of possibility, especially considering factors like economic performance, foreign policy developments, and campaign strategies. Additionally, 538's polling methodology is generally robust, reducing the likelihood of significant deviations from actual voter sentiment.\n\nFor scenario (b), the likelihood of a brokered Democratic convention depends on the primary contest's competitiveness. If the Democratic primaries yield a clear frontrunner with substantial support, a brokered convention becomes highly unlikely. However, if the primary race remains tightly contested with no candidate securing a majority of delegates, the probability of a brokered convention increases.

Publishing a report on external red-teaming efforts aligns with industry trends emphasizing ethical AI practices. Given Meta's resources and focus on AI safety, it's plausible they might undertake such reporting within the next year. However, the specific deadline of June 30, 2024, introduces uncertainty regarding internal timelines, coordination with external parties, and the comprehensiveness of the report. Without explicit announcements or commitments from Meta, assigning a high probability is cautious, but the likelihood remains moderate due to industry pressures and Meta's public commitments.\n\n(b) **Market Trader Threshold:** The linked market on Manifold Markets reaching 377 traders by July 15, 2024, depends on factors like the market's visibility, subject matter appeal, promotional efforts, and the existing user base on the platform. Achieving 377 traders is a substantial target, especially if the market is niche or lacks significant promotion. Unless there are active campaigns or the market topic resonates strongly with a large audience, reaching this number of traders within the specified timeframe is challenging. Without evidence of such efforts or inherent virality, the probability of meeting this threshold remains low.\n\n**Combining Both Scenarios:** Since the query resolves to \"YES\" if either (a) or (b) occurs, we assess the combined probability. With (a) having a moderate likelihood and (b) a low likelihood, the overall probability that at least one of the events occurs leans more toward the likelihood of (a) happening, while (b) remains unlikely to influence the outcome significantly."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.021969568218705382, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0054923920546763455, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.21011927654376672, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
