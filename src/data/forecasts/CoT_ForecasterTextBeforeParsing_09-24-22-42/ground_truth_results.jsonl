Mike Pence has not officially announced his candidacy yet. 2. Pence's relationship with Trump: As Trump's former Vice President, Pence has distanced himself from Trump, particularly after the events of January 6, 2021. This has likely alienated him from Trump's base, which is a significant portion of the Republican electorate. 3. Pence's appeal: While Pence has experience as Vice President and Governor of Indiana, he lacks the charisma and broad appeal that typically characterizes successful presidential candidates. His conservative stance might appeal to traditional Republicans but may not resonate with moderates or independents. 4. Fundraising and support: Pence would need to build a strong campaign infrastructure and raise significant funds to compete with other well-funded candidates. As he hasn't officially entered the race, he's already behind in these aspects. 5. Polling data: Current polls do not show strong support for Pence among Republican voters. He consistently ranks below Trump, DeSantis, and other candidates in primary polls. 6. Time until the convention: The Republican National Convention is still over a year away, which means there's time for the political landscape to change. However, Pence would need to gain significant momentum to become a frontrunner. 7.

Haley's campaign performance: While Haley has gained some traction and is considered one of the more viable alternatives to Trump, she has struggled to gain substantial support in polls and primary contests so far. 3.

He has gained some attention as a conservative commentator and entrepreneur, but he lacks the political experience and name recognition of many other potential candidates. 2. Polling data: In current polls for the Republican primary, Ramaswamy is consistently polling in the low single digits, far behind frontrunners like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. 3. Fundraising: While Ramaswamy has personal wealth, his campaign fundraising has not been as substantial as other major candidates, which could limit his ability to compete in a long primary process. 4. Political experience: Ramaswamy has never held elected office, which is typically seen as a disadvantage in presidential races. Voters and party officials often prefer candidates with governing experience. 5. Competition: The Republican field is likely to be crowded with experienced politicians and well-known figures. Candidates like Trump, DeSantis, and others have stronger bases of support within the party. 6. Time until convention: While there is still time until the Republican National Convention in 2024, it would require a significant and unlikely shift in the political landscape for Ramaswamy to surge to the top of the field. 7. Party establishment support: There's little evidence that Ramaswamy has significant support from the Republican party establishment, which can be crucial in securing the nomination. 8. Media coverage: While Ramaswamy has received some media attention, it's not at the level of the frontrunners, which makes it harder for him to build widespread support.

While the IOC is considering allowing them to compete as neutral athletes, the ongoing war in Ukraine and international pressure may lead to stricter measures. The specific criterion of no more than 34 Russian athletes being allowed to compete makes it even more likely for this question to resolve as \"Yes\". This number is significantly lower than the number of Russian athletes who participated in previous Olympics, even under restrictions. However, there is still uncertainty due to the time remaining before the Olympics and potential changes in the global situation.

This suggests that S&D would need to gain a significant number of seats to overtake EPP. 2.

Current composition: As of 2023, the ID group is the 5th largest group in the European Parliament with 62 seats out of 705 total seats. This puts them significantly behind the current leading groups like the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). 2. Rising populism: There has been a trend of increasing support for right-wing populist parties across Europe in recent years. The ID group consists of such parties, which could potentially lead to increased support. 3. Recent national elections: Some member parties of the ID group have seen success in recent national elections. For example, the National Rally in France and the Freedom Party in the Netherlands have gained ground. 4. Fragmentation of traditional parties: Mainstream center-right and center-left parties have been losing ground in many European countries, which could benefit more extreme parties on both sides of the political spectrum. 5. Voter turnout: European Parliament elections typically have lower voter turnout than national elections, which can sometimes benefit more motivated, often more extreme, voter bases. 6. Coalition dynamics: Even if the ID group gains seats, other groups may form coalitions to prevent them from becoming the largest group. 7. Time until the election: The election is still about a year away, and a lot can change in European politics during that time. 8. Historical precedent: No far-right group has ever held the most seats in the European Parliament, which suggests it would be a significant shift from historical patterns. While the ID group may well increase its seat share in the 2024 elections due to rising populism and fragmentation of traditional parties, it seems unlikely that they will gain enough seats to become the largest group. The gap between their current position (5th largest) and the top spot is substantial, and other major groups are likely to retain significant support.

Competition: The Republican field for 2024 is expected to be crowded with more prominent figures such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others who have higher national profiles and stronger fundraising capabilities. 3. Name recognition: Burgum lacks the national name recognition that many of his potential competitors enjoy. This would make it difficult for him to gain traction in early primary states. 4. Fundraising: As a lesser-known candidate, Burgum would likely struggle to raise the substantial funds necessary to run a competitive national campaign. 5. Policy positions: While Burgum is a conservative Republican, his moderate stance on some issues might not appeal to the more conservative base of the Republican Party that often dominates primary voting. 6. Political experience: Although he has executive experience as a governor, Burgum lacks federal-level political experience, which could be seen as a disadvantage compared to candidates who have served in Congress or in previous administrations. 7. Timing: The resolution date is set for August 1, 2024, which is likely after the Republican National Convention. This means we're assessing the probability of Burgum winning the entire primary process. 8.

Legal battles are widely expected, and these disputes might reach the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThis question focuses on whether these and similar ongoing discussions and legal challenges will result in Donald Trump being removed from the primary election ballot of any state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15th, 2024, the planned start of the 2024 Republican National Convention."}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of this event occurring, we need to consider several factors: 1. Legal precedent: There have been attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates in the past, but they have rarely been successful. However, the January 6th events have created a unique situation. 2. Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in several states to remove Trump from the ballot using this argument. Colorado and Maine have already made decisions to remove Trump from their primary ballots, though these decisions are being appealed. 3. Supreme Court involvement: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the Colorado case, which could set a precedent for all states. Their decision will be crucial in determining the outcome across the country. 4. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which gives ample time for legal proceedings to unfold and for states to make decisions based on court rulings. 5. Political climate: The issue is highly contentious and politically charged, which could influence decision-making processes in different states. 6. State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently, especially if the Supreme Court's decision leaves room for interpretation. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that at least one state will have removed or blocked Trump from their primary ballot by July 15, 2024. The Colorado and Maine decisions, although under appeal, show that some states are willing to take this step. Even if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado's decision, it's possible that other states might find alternative legal grounds or interpretations to justify ballot removal. However, the Supreme Court's involvement adds uncertainty. If they rule decisively against such removals, it would significantly reduce the likelihood of this outcome. But if they rule in favor or provide a nuanced decision, it could embolden more states to take similar actions. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high probability of this occurring."}, "prob": 0.65}, "prob": 0.65, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.5146, "brier_score": 0.4225, "brier_score_scaled": -69.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.4179, "brier_score": 0.1747, "brier_score_scaled": 30.1, "log_score": 0.7807}}

Competition: The Republican field for 2024 is already crowded with high-profile candidates such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, and others. These candidates have more national recognition and established bases of support. 3. Polling: Current national polls for the Republican primary do not show Youngkin as a top-tier candidate. He consistently polls behind Trump, DeSantis, and several others. 4. Fundraising: Youngkin has not announced a presidential run, and therefore has not begun serious fundraising efforts for a national campaign. 5. Name recognition: While known in Virginia and among political observers, Youngkin lacks the national name recognition of many of his potential competitors. 6. Experience: With only a few years as governor and no federal experience, Youngkin's political resume is relatively thin compared to many other candidates. 7. Timing: As of now, Youngkin has not officially declared his candidacy for the 2024 presidential race. The longer he waits, the harder it will be to build a national campaign infrastructure. 8. Party dynamics: The Republican Party is currently grappling with its identity, torn between Trump-style populism and more traditional conservatism. It's unclear where Youngkin would fit in this spectrum or if he could unite these factions. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Glenn Youngkin will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

While RESP-NET does not collect data on all hospitalizations caused by respiratory illnesses, it can describe hospitalizations caused by three viruses that account for a large proportion of these hospitalizations. Surveillance is conducted through a network of acute care hospitals in select counties or county equivalents in 12 states for RSV surveillance, 13 states for COVID-19 surveillance, and 14 states for influenza surveillance. The surveillance platforms for COVID-19, RSV, and influenza (known as [COVID-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covid-net/purpose-methods.html), [RSV-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/overview-methods.html), and [FluSurv-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/influenza-hospitalization-surveillance.htm), respectively) cover more than 30 million people and include an estimated 8-10% of the U.S. population.\n\nThe underlying source data for the RESP-NET dashboard can be found at [this link](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-Laboratory-Confirmed-RSV-COVID-19-and-Flu/kvib-3txy).\n\nIn its [Respiratory Disease Season Outlook](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/whats-new/2023-2024-season-outlook.html) for 2023-24, the CDC describes the 2022-23 peak as a \"tripledemic\" due to high incidence of COVID, flu, and RSV at the same time.

Timing of peaks: COVID-19, influenza, and RSV typically have different peak times during the respiratory virus season. However, there's a possibility of overlap or close succession. 2. Historical patterns: In previous years, these viruses have sometimes peaked at different times, with RSV often peaking earlier in the season, followed by influenza, and then COVID-19. 3. Variability of seasons: Each respiratory virus season can be unique, influenced by factors such as virus mutations, population immunity, and public health measures. 4. Data reporting and revisions: The CDC's data can be subject to revisions and reporting delays, which could affect the timing of observed peaks. 5. Length of the window: The four-week (28-day) window provides some flexibility for the peaks to occur close to each other but not necessarily simultaneously. 6. Current trends: As of December 2023, we're seeing increases in all three viruses, which could potentially lead to closer peak times. 7. Vaccination rates: Vaccination rates for COVID-19 and influenza could influence the timing and severity of peaks. 8. Public health response: Measures taken to control one virus might affect the spread of others. Given these considerations, I believe there's a moderate to high chance that the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations for all three viruses combined will occur within four weeks of each individual virus's peak. The four-week window provides enough flexibility to capture peaks that are close but not exactly simultaneous. Additionally, the overlapping nature of these respiratory viruses during the winter season increases the likelihood of peaks occurring relatively close together.

Competition from other nations: Other countries have been improving their Olympic performances, which could make it more challenging for INAs to win a high number of gold medals. 7. Psychological factors: Competing as neutral athletes, without national symbols or anthem, could potentially impact performance positively (extra motivation) or negatively (lack of national identity). 8.

Recent performance: Lithuania has qualified for the Grand Final in the last four consecutive years (2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023). This recent streak suggests they've been selecting stronger entries and improving their qualification chances. 3. Voting patterns: Lithuania often receives support from other Baltic countries and the diaspora vote, which can help in the semi-finals. 4.

This process has been relatively successful in recent years in selecting competitive entries. 5.

It's uncertain if the country now has the willingness to allocate funds for this purpose. 5. Qualification process: If Luxembourg were to return, they would likely have to compete in a semi-final. Qualifying from the semi-final can be challenging, especially for countries without recent Eurovision experience or a large diaspora voting bloc. 6.

This demonstrates a consistent ability to perform well in the competition. 2. Recent success: Ukraine won Eurovision in 2022 and placed 6th in 2023, showing that they continue to be competitive in recent years. 3.

Semi-final placement: The semi-final in which Ukraine is placed can affect their chances, but given their strong track record, this is less of a concern for them compared to other countries. 6.

Time frame: The question asks about arrest warrants being issued before July 1, 2024, which gives approximately 14 months from the question's creation date. 4. ICC process: Issuing arrest warrants is a complex and time-consuming process. The ICC must gather evidence, conduct investigations, and build a case before issuing warrants. 5. Political considerations: There would likely be significant political pressure against issuing arrest warrants for high-ranking Israeli officials, particularly from Israel's allies like the United States. 6. Precedent: The ICC has not previously issued arrest warrants for sitting leaders of Western-aligned countries, which could make this action less likely. 7. Israeli cooperation: Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction, which could complicate the investigation and warrant process. 8. Severity of allegations: The severity and scale of alleged crimes in the current conflict might increase pressure on the ICC to act.

This ongoing conflict increases the likelihood of diplomatic actions. 2. Historical precedent: In the past, there have been instances of diplomatic tensions between the two countries, but full-scale expulsions or recalls have been rare. 3. Time frame: The question asks about events occurring before June 1, 2024, which is a relatively short period (about two weeks from the question's creation date). This limited timeframe reduces the probability of such significant diplomatic actions occurring. 4. Recent developments: As of the question's creation date, there haven't been any recent major escalations that would immediately suggest imminent diplomatic expulsions or recalls. 5. Diplomatic alternatives: Both countries generally prefer to resolve disputes through negotiations and other diplomatic channels before resorting to expulsions or recalls. 6. International pressure: The international community, particularly ASEAN and the United States, often encourages peaceful resolution of disputes in the region, which may discourage extreme diplomatic actions. 7. Economic ties: The two countries have significant economic relationships, which both sides may be hesitant to jeopardize through severe diplomatic actions. Given these factors, while tensions exist between the Philippines and China, the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring in the short timeframe before June 1, 2024, seems relatively low.

Historical context: While tensions between China and Taiwan have existed for decades, direct armed conflict resulting in military casualties has been rare in recent years. 2. Current geopolitical situation: Relations between China and Taiwan have been strained, with China increasing military pressure on Taiwan through air and naval exercises. However, both sides have generally shown restraint in avoiding direct confrontation. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a relatively short period (about two weeks from the creation date to the resolution date). This narrow window reduces the likelihood of a significant escalation leading to armed conflict. 4. International pressure: The global community, especially the United States, has a vested interest in maintaining stability in the region. This external pressure acts as a deterrent to open conflict. 5. Economic considerations: Both China and Taiwan have strong economic ties with each other and the rest of the world. An armed conflict would have severe economic consequences, which both sides likely want to avoid. 6. Military preparedness: While both sides maintain military readiness, initiating a conflict that would result in casualties within such a short timeframe would require a significant and rapid escalation of current tensions. 7. Recent precedents: There have been no recent incidents of direct armed conflict between Chinese and Taiwanese forces resulting in casualties, which suggests a continuation of the status quo is more likely. 8. Diplomatic channels: Despite tensions, diplomatic channels between China and Taiwan, as well as with other involved parties, remain open, allowing for de-escalation of potential crises. Given these factors, while the possibility of an armed conflict cannot be completely ruled out due to the ongoing tensions, it seems unlikely that there will be an armed forces conflict death between China and Taiwan in the short period before June 6, 2024.

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\n\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\n\n>Tesla\u2019s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\n\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\n\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\n\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\n\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\n\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\n\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has [advised](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1) shareholders *not* to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\n\n---------------------\n\nSee related question:\n\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)"}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of this question resolving as YES, we need to consider several factors: 1. Historical precedent: ISS has previously recommended against Elon Musk's compensation package and Kimbal Musk's re-election. In 2022, ISS advised shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, citing concerns about its size and structure. They have also previously recommended against Kimbal Musk's re-election, citing a lack of relevant industry experience. 2. Recent developments: Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package was recently voided by a Delaware judge, who ruled that the board process leading to the approval was deeply flawed. This legal setback might influence ISS's stance on any new compensation package. 3. Corporate governance concerns: ISS typically focuses on good corporate governance practices. The close relationship between Elon and Kimbal Musk, as brothers, might be seen as a potential conflict of interest in board composition. 4. Tesla's performance and stock price: While Tesla has been successful overall, recent challenges including increased competition and reduced profit margins might influence ISS's recommendations. 5. Timing: The question resolution date is set for June 12, 2024, which aligns with the typical timing for annual shareholder meetings and proxy advisor recommendations. 6. ISS's consistent approach: Proxy advisors like ISS tend to maintain consistent positions on governance issues unless there are significant changes in circumstances. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that ISS will recommend against either Elon Musk's compensation package or Kimbal Musk's re-election, or both. The recent court decision on Elon's pay package and the ongoing concerns about board independence make it particularly probable that ISS will maintain its critical stance. However, there is always a possibility that Tesla could make changes to address previous concerns, or that other factors could influence ISS's decision. Additionally, the exact details of any new compensation package for Elon Musk are not known at this time, which adds some uncertainty. Considering all these factors, I estimate a high probability that ISS will advise against either the compensation package or Kimbal Musk's re-election."}, "prob": 0.85}, "prob": 0.85, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.2345, "brier_score": 0.0225, "brier_score_scaled": 91.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.4688, "brier_score": 0.2822, "brier_score_scaled": -12.9, "log_score": 1.093}}

Voter sentiment: Despite controversies and criticism from the EU, Fidesz-KDNP has maintained a solid support base in Hungary. Their nationalist and conservative policies continue to resonate with a significant portion of the electorate. 5. Short timeframe: The question was created on June 2, 2024, and resolves on June 11, 2024. This suggests that the election is imminent or has just occurred, leaving little time for major shifts in voter preferences. 6. Incumbency advantage: As the current plurality holder, Fidesz-KDNP has the advantage of incumbency, which often helps in maintaining electoral support. 7. EU-Hungary relations: While tensions between Hungary and the EU have been high, this has often worked in Fidesz-KDNP's favor domestically, as they position themselves as defenders of Hungarian interests against perceived EU overreach. Given these factors, it appears highly likely that Fidesz-KDNP will maintain its plurality in the 2024 European Parliament elections. Their strong historical performance, current political dominance, and the fragmented opposition all point towards a favorable outcome for them. However, there's always a degree of uncertainty in elections, and unexpected events or last-minute shifts in voter sentiment could occur."}, "prob": 0.85}, "prob": 0.85, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.2345, "brier_score": 0.0225, "brier_score_scaled": 91.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.4688, "brier_score": 0.2822, "brier_score_scaled": -12.9, "log_score": 1.093}}

These risks range from the further entrenchment of existing inequalities, to manipulation and misinformation, to the loss of control of autonomous AI systems potentially resulting in human extinction. AI companies themselves have acknowledged these risks [1, 2, 3], as have governments across the world [4, 5, 6] and other AI experts [7, 8, 9].\n\n> We are hopeful that these risks can be adequately mitigated with sufficient guidance from the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. However, AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.\n\n> AI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm. However, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\n\n> So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues. Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated. Some of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry. We are not the first to encounter or speak about these issues.\n\n> **We therefore call upon advanced AI companies to commit to these principles.**\n\n> 1. **That the company will not enter into or enforce** any agreement that prohibits \u201cdisparagement\u201d or criticism of the company for risk-related concerns, nor retaliate for risk-related criticism by hindering any vested economic benefit;\n2. **That the company will facilitate a verifiably anonymous process** for current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise;\n3. **That the company will support a culture of open criticism** and allow its current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns about its technologies to the public, to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, or to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise, so long as trade secrets and other intellectual property interests are appropriately protected;\n4. **That the company will not retaliate against current and former employees who publicly share risk-related confidential information after other processes have failed.** We accept that any effort to report risk-related concerns should avoid releasing confidential information unnecessarily. Therefore, once an adequate process for anonymously raising concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise exists, we accept that concerns should be raised through such a process initially.

Current stance: OpenAI has not yet made such a commitment, which suggests that they haven't been immediately receptive to the idea. However, they also haven't outright rejected it. 3. Industry trends: There's a growing emphasis on AI safety and ethics in the tech industry. Many companies are under pressure to adopt more transparent and responsible AI development practices. 4.

Potential benefits: Adopting this principle could improve OpenAI's public image and potentially attract more talent concerned with ethical AI development. 7. Potential risks: OpenAI might be hesitant to make such a commitment if they believe it could lead to uncontrolled information leaks or competitive disadvantages. 8.

The country is facing economic challenges and international pressures, which might influence the Guardian Council's decision-making process. 5. Guardian Council's tendencies: The Guardian Council is known for its conservative stance and tendency to approve candidates who align closely with the establishment's views. Ahmadinejad's populist approach and unpredictable nature may not fit well with their preferences. 6.

While this keeps him in the public eye, it may also be viewed unfavorably by the Guardian Council. 7.

Relevance of 'deepfake' technology: Deepfakes have become increasingly prevalent and concerning in recent years, especially in politics. By 2024, this technology is likely to be even more advanced and potentially a significant issue in the election. 2. Current political climate: Both Trump and Biden have been subjects of deepfake videos, and there's growing concern about the impact of such technology on elections and public perception. 3. Debate topics: Given the importance of information integrity in elections, it's plausible that topics related to misinformation and technology manipulation could come up in the debate. 4. Time frame: The debate is scheduled for June 2024, which is in the heat of the presidential campaign. This increases the likelihood of discussing current technological threats to the election process. 5. Previous debates: While I don't have specific data on whether 'deepfake' was mentioned in previous presidential debates, the increasing relevance of the topic makes it more likely to be brought up in 2024. 6. Candidate profiles: Both Trump and Biden have shown awareness of deepfake technology in the past. Trump, in particular, has been vocal about media manipulation, which could lead him to bring up the topic. 7. Moderator's role: CNN moderators are likely to be well-informed about current technological threats to information integrity and might bring up the topic if the candidates don't. However, we should also consider factors that might reduce the likelihood: 1. Limited time: Presidential debates cover a wide range of topics, and there's no guarantee that this specific issue will be addressed. 2. Vocabulary choice: Even if the topic of manipulated media is discussed, the exact term 'deepfake' might not be used, as more general terms like 'AI-generated content' or 'manipulated media' could be employed instead. 3. Focus on other issues: Depending on the state of the country and world in June 2024, other pressing issues might take precedence in the debate. Given these considerations, I believe there's a moderate chance that the word 'deepfake' will be mentioned, but it's far from certain.

Current market capitalization: As of June 2023, Docusign's market cap is significantly higher than Gamestop's. Docusign's market cap is around $10-11 billion, while Gamestop's is around $7-8 billion. 2. Historical performance: Gamestop has been known for its volatile stock price, especially during the meme stock frenzy of 2021. However, its price has stabilized somewhat since then. Docusign, on the other hand, has seen a more steady decline since its peak in 2021. 3. Business models and future prospects: - Gamestop is trying to pivot from a brick-and-mortar video game retailer to a more digital-focused company, but faces significant challenges in this transition. - Docusign is a leader in the e-signature market, which has good growth prospects, but the company faces increasing competition. 4. Market conditions: The tech sector, which Docusign is part of, has been under pressure due to rising interest rates and economic uncertainties. This could continue to affect Docusign's valuation. 5. Time frame: The question asks about the situation approximately one year from now, which is a relatively short time for significant changes in market cap, barring any major events. 6. Meme stock factor: Gamestop still retains some of its meme stock status, which could lead to unexpected price movements based on retail investor sentiment. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Gamestop will overtake Docusign in market capitalization by June 28, 2024. The gap between their market caps is substantial, and while Gamestop has shown volatility in the past, it would require a significant increase in Gamestop's value or a substantial decrease in Docusign's value (or both) for this to occur. However, the possibility cannot be completely ruled out due to the potential for unexpected events, particularly given Gamestop's history of volatility and its status as a meme stock."}, "prob": 0.15}, "prob": 0.15, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.2345, "brier_score": 0.0225, "brier_score_scaled": 91.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.1886, "brier_score": 0.0356, "brier_score_scaled": 85.8, "log_score": 0.3016}}

However, he has never been successfully elected as an MP despite multiple attempts. 2. Current political landscape: As of 2023, Farage is not currently affiliated with a major political party. He left the Brexit Party (now Reform UK) in 2021. This lack of party backing could significantly hinder his chances of being elected. 3. Constituency selection: For Farage to be elected, he would need to run in a constituency where he has a realistic chance of winning. Historically, he has struggled to find such a constituency. 4. Public opinion: While Farage has a dedicated base of supporters, he is also a polarizing figure. His views on Brexit and immigration have made him controversial, which could limit his appeal to a broader electorate. 5. Electoral system: The UK uses a first-past-the-post system, which tends to favor established parties. Independent candidates or those from smaller parties often struggle to win seats. 6. Time frame: The question specifies the election date as July 4, 2024, which is about a year away from the current date. This gives Farage some time to potentially align with a party or build a campaign, but it's a relatively short period for significant political maneuvering. 7.

However, this is more likely to benefit established opposition parties rather than individual candidates like Farage. 8.

Current agreement status: The most recent extension of the agreement between Verisign and the US Department of Commerce was made in 2018, extending Verisign's management of the .com TLD until November 30, 2024. This date is beyond the resolution date of this question (August 3, 2024). 3. Time frame: The question asks about a change occurring before August 3, 2024, which is less than a month from the creation date of the question. Major changes in internet infrastructure typically require significant lead time and planning. 4. Lack of public discussion or controversy: There have been no recent major public discussions or controversies regarding Verisign's management of the .com TLD that would suggest an imminent change. 5. Stability and security concerns: The .com TLD is crucial to the global internet infrastructure. Any change in its management would require careful planning to ensure continued stability and security. Abrupt changes are unlikely. 6. Regulatory environment: While changes in internet governance are possible, they typically involve lengthy processes, public consultations, and international coordination. There's no indication of such a process being underway. 7. Economic factors: Verisign's management of the .com TLD is a significant business arrangement. Any change would likely involve complex negotiations and financial considerations, which are unlikely to be concluded in such a short timeframe. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the US government would end its agreement with Verisign for managing the .com TLD before August 3, 2024.

Crossover appeal: Combining these two characters is likely to attract fans of both, potentially expanding the audience beyond what either could achieve individually. 4. Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) integration: This film is expected to be part of the MCU, which could broaden its appeal to general Marvel fans. 5. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman: Both actors are immensely popular and their on-screen chemistry and off-screen friendship have been widely publicized, adding to the film's appeal. 6. Inflation and ticket prices: Since 2013 and 2016, movie ticket prices have increased, which naturally inflates box office numbers. 7. Post-pandemic box office recovery: While the movie industry has been recovering, there's still some uncertainty about audience behavior. 8. Competition and release timing: The success will partly depend on what other films are released around the same time and the specific release date chosen. 9. Marketing push: Given the high-profile nature of this film, it's likely to receive a significant marketing budget, increasing awareness and anticipation. 10. R-rating: Like previous Deadpool films, this is likely to be R-rated, which could limit some audience reach but also appeals to the core fan base. Considering these factors, especially the combined star power, the crossover appeal, and the integration into the MCU, it seems highly likely that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will surpass the combined opening weekend of its predecessors. The target of $185,548,391 is substantial, but given the increased ticket prices and the heightened anticipation for this film, it appears achievable.

However, Apple is a more diversified company with a strong ecosystem and brand loyalty. 3. Market trends: The tech sector, especially AI-related companies, has been experiencing significant growth. This trend could continue, benefiting Nvidia more than Apple. 4. Time frame: The question is about the situation roughly one year from now.

Economic factors: Global economic conditions, regulatory changes, and technological advancements could impact both companies differently. 6. Historical precedent: While rapid changes in market cap rankings do occur, displacing the top company (especially one as established as Apple) is rare. Given these factors, while Nvidia has strong growth potential, overtaking Apple's market cap in just one year seems unlikely. Apple's diverse product line, strong brand, and massive cash reserves provide significant stability. For Nvidia to surpass Apple, it would require both exceptional growth from Nvidia and a significant downturn for Apple.

Current volatility: As of July 2023, the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) is relatively low compared to historical averages. This suggests that the market is currently experiencing a period of relative calm. Economic cycle: By July 2024, we will be further along in the economic cycle. Typically, as we progress through an economic cycle, the likelihood of increased volatility rises, especially if we're approaching a potential recession or economic downturn. Geopolitical events: Unforeseen geopolitical events can significantly impact market volatility. While we can't predict specific events, the probability of such occurrences increases over time. Monetary policy: The Federal Reserve's actions regarding interest rates and monetary policy can greatly influence market volatility. If the Fed continues to adjust rates or implement new policies, this could lead to increased volatility. Market valuations: If market valuations continue to rise over the next year, there may be increased concern about a potential market correction, which could lead to higher volatility. Technological disruptions: Rapid technological advancements and their impact on various industries can create uncertainty and potentially increase market volatility. Climate-related risks: As climate change concerns grow, their potential impact on markets and specific sectors may become more pronounced, possibly leading to increased volatility. Election year: 2024 is a U.S. presidential election year, which historically tends to increase market uncertainty and volatility, especially in the months leading up to the election in November. Given these factors, there is a reasonable chance that volatility could be higher in July 2024 compared to July 2023. However, it's important to note that predicting market volatility a year in advance is inherently challenging and subject to many unpredictable variables.

This provides multiple opportunities for athletes to compete and win medals. 2. Top players participating: While some top players may skip the Olympics, many still view it as a prestigious event. The participation of versatile players who excel in both singles and doubles increases the likelihood of multiple medal wins. 3.

Historical performance: In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), Russian athletes competing as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) won 20 gold medals. This suggests that Russian athletes, who are likely to make up a significant portion of INAs, have the potential to win a substantial number of gold medals. 2. Participation restrictions: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has allowed Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutral athletes, but with certain restrictions. This may limit the number of athletes participating and potentially reduce their chances of winning medals. 3. Competition in specific sports: Russian athletes have traditionally been strong in sports like gymnastics, wrestling, and swimming. Their performance in these events could significantly impact the total gold medal count for INAs. 4. Preparation and training: The uncertainty surrounding their participation and the potential lack of international competition due to sanctions may have affected the preparation of some athletes, potentially impacting their performance. 5. Motivation: Athletes competing as INAs may be highly motivated to prove themselves on the international stage, which could lead to strong performances. 6. Time frame: The market resolves on August 11, 2024, which is the last day of the Paris Olympics. This gives INAs the full duration of the Games to accumulate gold medals. 7. Comparison to previous Olympics: In the 2016 Rio Olympics, Russia (not as neutral athletes) won 19 gold medals. In 2012 London, they won 24 gold medals. This historical data suggests that reaching 15 gold medals is within the realm of possibility for INAs, assuming a significant portion are Russian athletes. Given these factors, I believe there is a reasonable chance that INAs could win 15 or more gold medals.

Historical trends: The USD/JPY pair has been relatively volatile in recent years. It reached levels above 145 in 2022 but has since retreated. 3. Economic factors: a) Interest rate differentials: The Federal Reserve has been more aggressive in raising rates compared to the Bank of Japan, which tends to support a stronger USD. b) Inflation: Both countries are dealing with inflation, but Japan's inflation has been lower. c) Economic growth: The US economy has shown resilience, while Japan's growth has been slower. 4. Policy expectations: a) The Fed may continue its tightening cycle or pause, depending on economic data. b) The Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, but there are speculations about potential changes. 5. Geopolitical factors: Trade tensions, global economic uncertainties, and geopolitical events can influence currency movements. 6.

Current performance: 'Deadpool & Wolverine' has been dominating the box office, already in its third weekend. It grossed $96.8M in its opening weekend, which is a very strong performance. 2. Franchise power: 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is part of the Marvel universe and has a strong, established fan base. These types of movies tend to have staying power at the box office. 3. 'It Ends With Us' factors: a. Book popularity: The film is based on a mega-bestseller by Colleen Hoover, which could translate to strong audience interest. b. Star power: Blake Lively is a well-known actress, which could draw audiences. c. Genre: As a romantic drama, it appeals to a different demographic than 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' which could work in its favor. 4.

'Deadpool & Wolverine' will be in its third weekend, where drops of 50% or more are common for blockbusters. 5. Competition: We don't have information about other major releases that weekend, which could impact both films' performances. 6.

Given these factors, while 'It Ends With Us' might perform well due to its source material and star power, it seems highly unlikely that it would outgross 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' Even with a strong opening and a significant drop for 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' the gap in their performances is likely to be substantial.

Recent trends in video game adaptations: Movies like 'The Super Mario Bros.

Production quality: While we don't have specific details about the production, a high-budget adaptation with a strong cast and crew could increase the chances of a positive reception. 5. Director and cast: Eli Roth is directing, known for horror films, which might be an interesting choice for this action-comedy franchise. The cast includes Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, and Jamie Lee Curtis, which could positively influence audience reception. 6.

Marketing and expectations: How the movie is marketed and what expectations are set for audiences can significantly impact CinemaScore ratings. Given these factors, I believe 'Borderlands' has a good chance of receiving a CinemaScore of B- or above.

This is a relatively high starting point, suggesting she's already considered competitive. 2. Time frame: The resolution date is only one week away. In such a short period, dramatic shifts in polling or electoral predictions are less likely unless there's a major event. 3. Nate Silver's model: Silver's models are known for their stability and resistance to short-term fluctuations. They typically require sustained changes in polling or significant events to show substantial movement. 4. Current political climate: As of August 2024, we don't have specific information about major upcoming events or shifts in the political landscape that would dramatically alter Harris's chances in just one week. 5. Incumbent advantage: If Harris is the incumbent Vice President running for President, she might have a slight advantage in maintaining or improving her position. 6. Margin for improvement: With the current probability at 46.6%, there's room for improvement, but it's already close to the 50% mark, which represents an even contest. 7. Polling fluctuations: Even small changes in polling can affect model probabilities, but these are often within the margin of error and may not significantly impact the overall prediction. 8. Campaign activities: Normal campaign activities over a week are unlikely to cause major shifts in a well-established model. Given these factors, it seems more likely that Harris's probability will remain relatively stable or show only minor fluctuations.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) grossing over $20 million during its domestic opening weekend, we need to consider several factors: 1. Director's track record: M. Night Shyamalan has a mixed box office history, but he's known for creating buzz around his films. His recent movies have had varying degrees of success: - 'Old' (2021): $16.8 million opening - 'Glass' (2019): $40.3 million opening - 'Split' (2017): $40 million opening 2. Genre and appeal: 'Trap' is described as a psychological thriller, which is Shyamalan's forte. This genre typically has a dedicated audience but may not always reach blockbuster numbers. 3. Marketing and buzz: As of now, there's limited information about the marketing campaign for 'Trap.' Shyamalan's name alone generates interest, but the success will depend on the effectiveness of the marketing closer to release. 4. Release date and competition: The specific release date in 2024 and the competition from other films during that period will play a crucial role in its opening weekend performance. 5. Budget and studio support: The level of studio backing and budget allocation for marketing can significantly impact opening weekend numbers. 6. Cast appeal: The cast of 'Trap' includes Josh Hartnett, who has been less prominent in recent years. The drawing power of the cast is uncertain. 7. Post-pandemic box office trends: By 2024, the movie industry may have further stabilized, potentially leading to improved box office performances overall. 8. Shyamalan's recent performance: 'Old' opened below $20 million, but his previous two films opened well above. This suggests variability in his recent box office draw. Given these factors, it's a close call. Shyamalan has the potential to exceed $20 million, but it's not guaranteed. His name recognition and the thriller genre work in the film's favor, but the underwhelming performance of 'Old' and the uncertainties surrounding 'Trap' create doubt. Considering all these aspects, I believe there's a slightly better than even chance that 'Trap' will gross over $20 million in its domestic opening weekend, but it's far from certain."}, "prob": 0.55}, "prob": 0.55, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.152, "brier_score": 0.3025, "brier_score_scaled": -21.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.3871, "brier_score": 0.1498, "brier_score_scaled": 40.1, "log_score": 0.7062}}

Political context: Maria Corina Machado is a prominent opposition leader in Venezuela, a country known for its political instability and the government's tendency to suppress opposition figures. 2. Recent events: Without specific recent information, it's hard to determine if there's an immediate threat to Machado's freedom. However, the creation of this prediction market suggests there might be some ongoing tension or recent developments that have raised concerns about her potential imprisonment. 3. Time frame: The question asks about imprisonment within approximately 5 days (from the market creation date to the resolution date). This is a relatively short period, which reduces the likelihood of imprisonment unless there's an imminent threat or ongoing legal process. 4. Historical precedent: Venezuela has a history of imprisoning opposition leaders, including Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and Juan Guaid\u00f3 facing legal challenges. This suggests that the imprisonment of opposition figures is not uncommon in the country. 5. International attention: High-profile opposition leaders often receive international attention, which can sometimes act as a deterrent to immediate action by the government. However, this doesn't always prevent arrests. 6. Legal processes: If there are any ongoing legal proceedings against Machado, they would typically take longer than 5 days to result in imprisonment, unless it's an emergency measure or based on existing charges. Given these factors, while there's a real possibility of Machado being imprisoned given Venezuela's political climate, the short timeframe makes it less likely to occur before the specified date. The lack of specific recent events pointing to an imminent arrest also reduces the probability. However, the situation in Venezuela can be volatile, and unexpected developments could occur rapidly. Therefore, while I believe imprisonment is unlikely within this short period, it cannot be ruled out entirely."}, "prob": 0.15}, "prob": 0.15, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.2345, "brier_score": 0.0225, "brier_score_scaled": 91.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.1886, "brier_score": 0.0356, "brier_score_scaled": 85.8, "log_score": 0.3016}}

This suggests that finales tend to be highly rated. 2. Season 2 performance: The ratings for Season 2 have been more volatile. Out of the 6 episodes rated so far, only 1 (E4) has scored above 8.5, with a very high 9.6. The most recent episodes (E5 and E6) have seen a significant drop in ratings. 3. Finale expectations: Season finales often generate more excitement and are designed to be more impactful, which can lead to higher ratings. However, the recent downward trend in ratings might indicate dissatisfaction with the current storyline. 4. Fan engagement: The drastic drop in ratings for recent episodes (especially E6 with 6.1) suggests that fans are currently not very satisfied with the show's direction. This could either lead to lower expectations for the finale or create an opportunity for the finale to redeem the season. 5. Time for rating stabilization: The two-day window after release allows for a more settled rating, as initial reactions (both extremely positive and negative) tend to balance out. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that the finale will rate above 8.5, but it's far from certain. The show has demonstrated the ability to produce highly-rated episodes, especially for significant events like finales. However, the recent downward trend in ratings is concerning. The finale will likely need to address the issues that led to the recent low ratings and provide a satisfying conclusion to the season's storylines to achieve a rating above 8.5.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) receiving a CinemaScore of B or above, we need to consider several factors: 1. Recent track record: Looking at Shyamalan's recent films, we see a downward trend in CinemaScores: - 'Split' (2016): B+ - 'Glass' (2019): B - 'Old' (2021): C+ - 'Knock at the Cabin' (2023): C. This trend suggests that audience reception of his recent works has been declining. 2. Shyamalan's reputation: He's known for his twist endings and unique storytelling style. While this has garnered him a dedicated fan base, it has also led to mixed reactions from general audiences. 3. Genre and expectations: 'Trap' is described as a psychological thriller. Shyamalan tends to perform better with audiences in this genre compared to his more experimental works. 4. Trailer reception: The question mentions that 'Trap' has a great trailer. This could generate positive buzz and set appropriate expectations for the audience, potentially leading to better reception. 5. Audience fatigue: Given the mixed reception of his recent films, there might be some audience fatigue or skepticism towards Shyamalan's works. 6. Improvement potential: Filmmakers often learn from past experiences. Shyamalan might have taken audience feedback from his recent films into account while making 'Trap.' 7. CinemaScore tendencies: CinemaScore tends to skew higher for mainstream films, with B being a relatively common score. Considering these factors, I believe 'Trap' has a chance to break Shyamalan's recent downward trend, but it's not guaranteed. The positive trailer reception and the possibility that he's learned from recent audience feedback are encouraging signs. However, the recent trend of lower scores and potential audience skepticism work against it. Given this analysis, I estimate there's a slightly better than even chance that 'Trap' will receive a CinemaScore of B or above, but not by a large margin."}, "prob": 0.55}, "prob": 0.55, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.152, "brier_score": 0.3025, "brier_score_scaled": -21.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.3871, "brier_score": 0.1498, "brier_score_scaled": 40.1, "log_score": 0.7062}}

Competition: While Richardson is a top contender, the field in women's sprinting is highly competitive. Jamaican sprinters like Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Elaine Thompson-Herah have been dominant forces in recent Olympics. 3. Events: Richardson will compete in the 100m and potentially the 4x100m relay. This gives her two opportunities for gold, increasing her chances. 4. Olympic Experience: This will be Richardson's first Olympics, as she missed the Tokyo Games due to a suspension. Lack of Olympic experience could be a factor, but her World Championship performance shows she can handle high-pressure situations. 5. Form and Fitness: The Olympics are still a week away, and maintaining peak form and avoiding injuries will be crucial. 6. Relay Uncertainty: While she's likely to be part of the 4x100m relay team, the lineups haven't been announced yet, adding some uncertainty. 7. Olympic Pressure: The Olympics have a unique atmosphere that can affect athletes differently. Some rise to the occasion, while others may underperform due to pressure.

Current political landscape: As of now, Kamala Harris is the sitting Vice President, and Joe Biden is expected to run for re-election in 2024. It's highly unusual for a sitting VP to choose a running mate, as they are typically part of the incumbent ticket. 2. Timing: The question states that Kamala will choose before August 7th, 2024. This is very close to the Democratic National Convention, which is typically when the presidential nominee announces their VP pick. However, Biden would be the one making this decision, not Harris. 3. Candidates mentioned: a) Mark Kelly: A Democratic Senator from Arizona, former astronaut, and husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. He has a strong profile but is already serving in the Senate. b) Josh Shapiro: The current Governor of Pennsylvania, a key swing state. He has a rising profile in the Democratic Party. 4. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for a sitting VP to be replaced on the ticket for re-election. The last time this happened was in 1976 when Gerald Ford replaced Nelson Rockefeller with Bob Dole. 5. Current political situation: There have been no credible reports or indications that Biden is considering replacing Harris on the ticket. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that Kamala Harris would be in a position to choose her own running mate. The premise of the question appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the political process or on speculation that is not supported by current evidence. The most likely scenario is that Joe Biden will run for re-election with Kamala Harris as his running mate. If for some reason Biden decided not to run, Harris would likely be a presidential candidate herself, in which case she would choose a running mate. However, this scenario is not widely anticipated and would be a major political surprise.

Current tensions: There are ongoing tensions between the Philippines and China, particularly regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea. These tensions have escalated in recent years, with both countries engaging in maritime confrontations and diplomatic exchanges. 2. Historical precedent: In the past, there have been instances of diplomatic tensions between the two countries, but full-scale expulsions or recalls have been rare. This suggests that both nations generally prefer to maintain diplomatic channels even during disputes. 3. Recent developments: The Philippines has been increasingly assertive in defending its territorial claims, with support from the United States. This has led to more frequent confrontations with China in disputed waters. 4. Time frame: The question asks about events occurring before August 1, 2024, which is about 9 months from now. This is a relatively short time frame, but long enough for significant developments to occur. 5. International context: The broader geopolitical situation, including US-China relations and regional alliances, could influence the likelihood of diplomatic actions. 6. Domestic politics: Changes in leadership or shifts in domestic policy in either country could affect their approach to bilateral relations. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring. The ongoing tensions and increasing assertiveness from the Philippines increase the likelihood of such actions. However, both countries have historically shown restraint in escalating to full diplomatic expulsions, preferring other forms of protest or negotiation. The relatively short time frame somewhat reduces the probability, as it may take time for tensions to escalate to the point of expulsions or recalls. However, a single incident could rapidly change the situation. Considering all these factors, I estimate there is a moderate probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring before the specified date."}, "prob": 0.35}, "prob": 0.35, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.6215, "brier_score": 0.1225, "brier_score_scaled": 51.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.3085, "brier_score": 0.0952, "brier_score_scaled": 61.9, "log_score": 0.5321}}

Publication schedule: Chainsaw Man is serialized in Shonen Jump, which typically releases new chapters weekly. However, breaks are not uncommon in manga serialization. 2. Author's work pattern: Tatsuki Fujimoto, the creator of Chainsaw Man, has taken breaks between chapters in the past. This is common practice for manga artists to maintain their health and quality of work. 3. Timing: The question is asked on July 25, 2024, and the resolution date is August 6, 2024. This gives about two weeks for chapters 173 and 174 to be released. 4. Recent history: Without specific information about recent breaks or announcements, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether there will be a break. 5. Industry norms: It's common for manga series to have occasional breaks, especially after significant story arcs or before major events in the plot. 6. Lack of specific information: The question doesn't provide any recent context about the manga's publication schedule or any announcements from the author or publisher. Given these factors, it's challenging to make a highly confident prediction. However, considering that breaks are relatively common in manga serialization and that the author has taken breaks before, there's a moderate chance that there could be a break between chapters 173 and 174.

This leaves little room for major political changes or events to unfold. 3. Constitutional procedures: For Harris to become President or Acting President, one of the following would need to occur: a) Biden resigns (highly unlikely in such a short timeframe) b) Biden is removed from office via impeachment (a lengthy process that couldn't be completed in days) c) Biden becomes incapacitated, triggering the 25th Amendment (no current indications of this) 4. Biden's health: While Biden is the oldest president in US history, there have been no recent reports of severe health issues that would warrant an immediate transfer of power. 5. Planned absences: Sometimes, presidents temporarily transfer power during planned medical procedures. However, there are no publicly known plans for such events in the coming days. 6. Unforeseen emergencies: While it's possible for a sudden health emergency or other unforeseen event to occur, the probability of this happening in such a short time frame is very low.

Increased theater count: The question mentions that the new movie will likely play in more theaters than the original Deadpool, potentially increasing its reach and box office potential. 5. Inflation and ticket prices: Since the original Deadpool's release in 2016, ticket prices have generally increased, which could contribute to higher box office numbers. 6. Star power: Ryan Reynolds' popularity has grown since the first Deadpool, and the addition of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine adds significant star power. 7. Marketing and hype: The film is likely to have a strong marketing campaign, building on the success of previous Deadpool movies and the anticipation of seeing Wolverine return. 8. Post-pandemic box office recovery: As the movie industry continues to recover from the pandemic, audiences may be more eager to return to theaters for big events like this. However, there are some potential challenges: 1. R-rating: While the Deadpool franchise has proven successful with an R-rating, it still limits the potential audience compared to PG-13 superhero films. 2. Competition: Depending on other releases around the same time, the film could face stiff competition. 3. Economic factors: Global economic conditions could impact moviegoers' spending habits. 4. Critical reception: While early projections are positive, the actual reception of the film could influence opening weekend numbers. Given the strong projections, the combined star power, and the franchise's track record, it seems highly likely that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will break the R-rated opening weekend record. The projected numbers are well above the current record, providing a significant buffer even if the film slightly underperforms expectations."}, "prob": 0.85}, "prob": 0.85, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.2345, "brier_score": 0.0225, "brier_score_scaled": 91.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.4688, "brier_score": 0.2822, "brier_score_scaled": -12.9, "log_score": 1.093}}

This suggests that if Musk were to attend, it would likely be a last-minute decision or a surprise appearance. 3. Musk's unpredictability: He is known for making unexpected moves and announcements, which could work in favor of a surprise appearance. 4. Musk's busy schedule: As the CEO of multiple companies (Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter/X), Musk's time is extremely valuable and his schedule is likely to be very tight. 5. No prior announcements: As of the creation date of this question, there have been no public announcements or hints about Musk's attendance at the event. 6. Musk's current stance on Bitcoin: His recent statements and actions regarding Bitcoin could influence his decision to attend a major Bitcoin conference. 7. The event's prominence: Bitcoin Nashville is described as one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, which might make it attractive for high-profile figures like Musk to attend. 8. Time constraints: The event is only a few days long, which limits the window of opportunity for Musk to appear. Given these factors, I believe there is a small but non-negligible chance that Elon Musk could show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024. The short notice and lack of prior announcements work against his appearance, but his unpredictability and the event's prominence leave the possibility open.

Historical ratings: Looking at the provided ratings, we can see that out of the 15 episodes aired so far, 7 episodes (46.7%) have scored above 8.5. This suggests that achieving a score above 8.5 is not uncommon for the series. 2. Season 2 performance: Season 2 has been more volatile in terms of ratings compared to Season 1. We've seen both very high (9.6 for E4) and relatively low (7.6 for E5) ratings. This inconsistency makes prediction more challenging. 3. Recent trend: The most recent episode (E5) received a notably low rating of 7.6, which could indicate a dip in viewer satisfaction or a controversial storyline. However, it's also possible that this could lead to a rebound effect if the next episode addresses viewer concerns or delivers a particularly strong narrative. 4. Mid-season dynamics: E7 is typically a pivotal episode in a 10-episode season, often featuring significant plot developments or climactic events. This could potentially lead to a higher rating if executed well. 5. Fan expectations: Given the mixed reception of Season 2 so far, fans might be particularly critical of upcoming episodes, which could make it harder to achieve very high ratings. 6. Time for rating stabilization: The two-day window after release allows for a more settled rating, as initial extreme reactions (both positive and negative) tend to balance out. Considering these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that S2E7 will achieve a rating above 8.5. The show has demonstrated the ability to produce highly-rated episodes, even in Season 2.

While this is not young for a distance runner, many athletes have performed well at this age and beyond in endurance events. 4. Competition: The level of competition in women's distance running is always high, with strong contenders from East African countries and other nations. However, Hassan has proven she can compete with the best. 5. Versatility: Her ability to compete in multiple events (1500m, 5000m, 10,000m) increases her chances of medaling in at least one event. 6. Preparation: Olympic athletes typically plan their training cycles to peak for the Games. Assuming no injuries or setbacks, Hassan is likely to be well-prepared. 7. Pressure and experience: Having already succeeded at the Olympic level, Hassan has the experience to handle the pressure of the event.

Franchise popularity: Both Deadpool and Wolverine are extremely popular characters in the Marvel universe. Their combination in a single film is likely to generate significant buzz and attract fans of both characters. 2. Previous performance: 'Deadpool' (2016) had a strong opening of $132,434,639 and 'The Wolverine' (2013) opened with $53,113,752. The combined target to beat is $185,548,391. 3. Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) integration: This will be the first Deadpool movie in the MCU, which could potentially boost its appeal to a wider audience. 4. Star power: The film stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, both of whom have strong fan bases and have proven box office draw. 5. Nostalgia factor: Hugh Jackman's return as Wolverine after supposedly retiring from the role is likely to generate additional interest. 6. Inflation and ticket prices: Since 2013 and 2016, movie ticket prices have generally increased, which could contribute to a higher box office total. 7. Post-pandemic box office recovery: While the movie industry has been recovering from the pandemic, some hesitancy for in-theater viewing might still exist. 8. Competition and release timing: The success will partly depend on what other movies are released around the same time and the specific release date chosen. 9. Marketing push: Given the high-profile nature of this film, it's likely to receive a substantial marketing budget, increasing awareness and potential turnout. 10. Critical reception: Early reviews and word-of-mouth will play a role in the opening weekend performance. Considering these factors, especially the combined star power, the MCU integration, and the novelty of seeing these characters together, it seems highly likely that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will surpass the combined opening of its predecessors. The target of $185.5 million is substantial, but given the current state of blockbuster openings and the unique appeal of this film, it appears achievable. However, there's always some uncertainty in box office predictions, and factors like unexpected competition or poor critical reception could impact the results."}, "prob": 0.85}, "prob": 0.85, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.2345, "brier_score": 0.0225, "brier_score_scaled": 91.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.4688, "brier_score": 0.2822, "brier_score_scaled": -12.9, "log_score": 1.093}}

Current agreement: The Cooperative Agreement between the US Department of Commerce and Verisign for managing the .com domain was last amended in 2018, extending Verisign's management until November 30, 2024.

Any change in its management would need to ensure continued stability and security, which would likely require a long transition period. 5.

Team dynamics: Both drivers are part of the AlphaTauri team (assuming no changes for 2024). Tsunoda will have more experience with the team, while Ricciardo is a more seasoned driver overall. Circuit characteristics: The Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps is a challenging track that rewards both driver skill and car performance. Sprint race factor: The inclusion of sprint races adds an extra dimension to the scoring, potentially benefiting drivers who perform well in shorter formats. Historical performance: Ricciardo has had some strong performances at Spa in the past, including a win in 2014, but his recent form has been inconsistent. Car development: The performance of the 2024 AlphaTauri car is unknown at this point, which could significantly impact both drivers' performances. Tsunoda's progression: If Tsunoda continues to improve at his current rate, he could potentially outperform Ricciardo by 2024. Ricciardo's adaptation: Ricciardo's performance might improve if he becomes more comfortable with the AlphaTauri car by 2024. Given these factors, it's a close call. Tsunoda has been showing promise and continuous improvement, while Ricciardo has more experience but has struggled recently. The inclusion of sprint races might give a slight edge to Tsunoda, who has shown good performance in qualifying sessions. However, Ricciardo's experience and past success at Spa cannot be discounted entirely. The uncertainty about the 2024 car's performance also adds to the difficulty in predicting the outcome.

Popularity of Moana: The movie has been a significant success for Disney, and its popularity has remained strong since its release in 2016. This makes it a good candidate for a theme park attraction. 2. Existing Moana presence: Disney has already incorporated Moana into its parks in various ways, including meet-and-greets and the 'Journey of Water' attraction at EPCOT. This shows Disney's commitment to the IP. 3. Magic Kingdom's current offerings: Magic Kingdom is Disney World's most visited park, and they're always looking to add new attractions to maintain interest. A Moana ride could fit well with the park's themes. 4. Disney's recent focus: Disney has been investing heavily in updating its parks with new IP-based attractions, as seen with the addition of Guardians of the Galaxy and Ratatouille rides at EPCOT. 5. Timing: D23 is a major event where Disney often makes big announcements. The 2024 event would be a suitable platform for such an announcement. 6. Previous announcements: At the last D23, Disney did discuss some attractions in a 'spitballing ideas' sense, which didn't count as official announcements. This suggests they might be more cautious about firm announcements. 7. Competition with other IPs: Disney has many popular franchises, and Moana will be competing with these for new ride announcements. 8. Budget considerations: Theme park attractions are expensive, and Disney might be more conservative with spending in the current economic climate. 9. Existing plans: Disney might already have other plans for Magic Kingdom that could take precedence over a Moana ride. 10. The upcoming Moana sequel: With a Moana sequel announced for November 2024, Disney might want to capitalize on this by announcing a related attraction. Considering these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of Disney announcing a Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024. The popularity of the franchise, the upcoming sequel, and Disney's trend of adding IP-based attractions support this possibility. However, competition from other IPs, potential budget constraints, and the possibility of other plans for Magic Kingdom temper this likelihood."}, "prob": 0.45}, "prob": 0.45, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.8625, "brier_score": 0.2025, "brier_score_scaled": 19.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.3511, "brier_score": 0.1233, "brier_score_scaled": 50.7, "log_score": 0.624}}

Historical context: Magic Kingdom has been without a nighttime parade since 2016 when the Main Street Electrical Parade ended its run. This long absence suggests there might be demand for a new nighttime parade. 2. D23 Expo significance: D23 is Disney's official fan club, and the D23 Expo is a major event where Disney often makes significant announcements about their parks and entertainment offerings. This makes it a likely venue for such an announcement. 3. Walt Disney World's 50th Anniversary: The 50th anniversary celebrations ended in March 2023. Disney might be looking for new attractions to maintain interest and attendance post-celebration. 4. Competition: Universal Orlando is opening Epic Universe in 2025, which might prompt Disney to announce new attractions to stay competitive. 5. Financial considerations: Nighttime parades are expensive to produce and operate. Given recent financial challenges due to the pandemic, Disney might be cautious about introducing costly new entertainment. 6. Recent trend: Disney has been focusing more on projection shows and fireworks spectaculars rather than traditional parades in recent years. 7. Time frame: The question allows for an announcement anytime before the end of D23 2024, giving Disney ample time to develop and announce a new parade. 8. Lack of recent rumors: There haven't been strong rumors or leaks about a new nighttime parade, which often precede major announcements. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of Disney announcing a new night parade. The long absence of a nighttime parade at Magic Kingdom and the significance of D23 as an announcement platform work in favor of this possibility.

Current polling and forecasts: As of now (July 2023), Biden and Trump are the frontrunners for their respective parties, but the election is still over a year away. Current polls show a close race, with some giving Biden a slight edge and others favoring Trump. 2. FiveThirtyEight's methodology: FiveThirtyEight is known for its data-driven approach and tends to be more conservative in its predictions compared to other forecasters. They take into account various factors such as polling, economic indicators, and historical trends. 3. Timing: The forecast in question is for July 19, 2024, which is about 3.5 months before the election. At this point, the race is likely to be more solidified, with both candidates having secured their party nominations and engaged in campaigning. 4. Incumbent advantage: Biden, as the incumbent president, may have a slight advantage. Historically, incumbent presidents often have an edge in re-election bids, although this is not always the case. 5. Economic and political factors: The state of the economy, major policy decisions, and unforeseen events between now and July 2024 could significantly impact the forecast. 6. Previous election patterns: In 2020, FiveThirtyEight consistently showed Biden as the favorite, but the race was often portrayed as closer than the final result. This suggests they might lean towards caution in their predictions. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that FiveThirtyEight will project Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024. However, the margin is likely to be small, given the typically close nature of recent US presidential elections and FiveThirtyEight's cautious approach. The incumbent advantage, combined with FiveThirtyEight's tendency to favor data-driven approaches (which often benefit incumbents due to known performance), slightly tips the scales in Biden's favor.

Biden-Harris relationship: There have been no public indications of a rift between President Biden and VP Harris. They appear to work well together and maintain a united front. 3. Democratic Party unity: Changing the VP nominee could be seen as a sign of instability or lack of confidence in the current administration, which the Democratic Party would likely want to avoid. 4. Diversity representation: As the first woman, first African American, and first Asian American to hold the office of Vice President, Harris represents important diversity that the Democratic Party values. 5. Experience gained: Harris has gained valuable experience in her role as VP, making her more qualified for the position now than she was in 2020. 6. Lack of strong alternatives: There are no prominent Democratic figures who have been widely discussed as potential replacements for Harris. 7.

Historical performance: The U.S. has been dominant in Olympic basketball for both men and women. The men's team has won gold in 16 out of 19 Olympics they've participated in, including the last four consecutive Olympics. The women's team has been even more dominant, winning gold in 9 out of 11 Olympics they've participated in, including the last seven consecutive Olympics. 2. Current team strength: While the final rosters for the 2024 Olympics haven't been announced yet, the U.S. typically fields teams composed of NBA and WNBA stars, giving them a significant talent advantage over most other countries. 3. International competition: Other countries have been improving in basketball, with teams like Spain, France, and Australia becoming more competitive in recent years. However, the U.S. still remains the favorite in both men's and women's competitions. 4. Recent performances: The U.S. men's team won gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), while the women's team also secured gold. This demonstrates their continued dominance on the international stage. 5. Pressure and expectations: The high expectations placed on U.S. basketball teams can sometimes lead to underperformance, as seen in the 2004 Olympics when the men's team won bronze. However, this has been rare in recent years. 6. Potential for upsets: Basketball is a sport where upsets can happen, especially in a single-elimination tournament format. A bad shooting night or an exceptional performance by an opponent could lead to an unexpected loss. 7. Coaching and preparation: The U.S. teams typically have experienced coaches and thorough preparation, which helps mitigate the risk of upsets. Given these factors, the U.S. has a very strong chance of winning both gold medals. However, it's not a certainty due to the potential for upsets and the improving quality of international competition.

Biden's status: While Biden's age and some policy decisions have been topics of discussion, there hasn't been a widespread movement within the Democratic party to replace him as the nominee. 5. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for sitting presidents to be asked to drop out by their own party, especially this close to an election. 6.

Such a large group acting in unison on this issue is highly unlikely. 7.

Terunofuji's recent performance and health: As a Yokozuna (the highest rank in sumo), Terunofuji has been struggling with injuries in recent years. He has had to withdraw from several tournaments due to knee problems and other health issues. 2. Time until the tournament: The question is created about two weeks before the tournament starts. This gives some time for recovery if he's currently dealing with any minor injuries, but also leaves room for potential new issues to arise. 3. Pressure to compete: As a Yokozuna, there's significant pressure on Terunofuji to participate in full tournaments. However, this pressure can also lead to starting tournaments despite not being in peak condition. 4. Historical data: In recent years, Terunofuji has had a mixed record of completing full tournaments. He has had to withdraw from several, but has also managed to complete some. 5. Age and wear: Terunofuji is in his early 30s, which is considered late in a sumo career. The accumulated wear on his body, especially his knees, increases the risk of injury or inability to complete all 15 matches. 6. Tournament importance: The July tournament is one of the six main annual tournaments, which might increase his determination to participate fully. Given these factors, there's a significant risk that Terunofuji might not be able to participate in all 15 matches. While he may start the tournament, there's a considerable chance he might have to withdraw at some point due to injury or poor performance. The question specifically states that he must start all 15 matches to resolve as Yes, which means even if he starts the tournament but withdraws later, it would still resolve as No. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a higher chance of him not completing all 15 matches than completing them."}, "prob": 0.4}, "prob": 0.4, "resolution": true, "log_score": 1.3219, "brier_score": 0.36, "brier_score_scaled": -44.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.3308, "brier_score": 0.4478, "brier_score_scaled": -79.1, "log_score": 1.596}}

Leaks and unofficial confirmations: Given the number of people who would need to be informed before such an announcement, the likelihood of leaks is high. Media outlets often get unofficial confirmations from anonymous sources close to the situation. 5. Time frame: The question specifies at least 6 hours of advance coverage. This is a reasonable timeframe for news to break and spread before an official announcement. 6. Reliability of specified media outlets: The outlets mentioned (AP, CNN, NYT, WSJ, Fox News, Reuters, Washington Post) are all major, reputable sources with strong political reporting teams. Given these factors, if Biden were to drop out (which is itself unlikely), there's a very high chance that at least one of these major outlets would break the story well in advance of the official announcement. The competitive nature of journalism, the significance of the story, and the likelihood of leaks all point to early coverage. However, the overall probability must be low because the primary condition - Biden dropping out - is itself highly improbable."}, "prob": 0.05}, "prob": 0.05, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.074, "brier_score": 0.0025, "brier_score_scaled": 99.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.0908, "brier_score": 0.0082, "brier_score_scaled": 96.7, "log_score": 0.1374}}

Time frame: The resolution date is August 9, 2024, which gives about a year for the underlying markets to play out. 3. Tesla stock performance: The underlying market is about Tesla stock reaching $275 by 88% of the way through 2024.

Given these factors, I would assess the probability as follows: - Tesla stock reaching $275 by late 2024 seems reasonably likely given current levels, but there's significant uncertainty over such a long timeframe. - Even if the underlying event occurs, TSLABull needs to trade profitably, which adds another layer of uncertainty. - The nested nature of the markets increases complexity and potential for mispricing, which could create opportunities for a skilled trader. - However, the market maker's edge and the general difficulty of consistent profitability in prediction markets work against TSLABull.

Current price: As of July 2023, silver is trading around $23-$24 per ounce. To reach $30.50, it would need to increase by about 27-32% in just over a year. 2. Historical trends: Silver prices have been volatile in the past. The last time silver was consistently above $30 was in 2012-2013. It briefly touched $30 in August 2020 during the pandemic-induced market volatility. 3. Economic factors: Silver prices are influenced by industrial demand (it's used in electronics, solar panels, etc.), investment demand, and its status as a safe-haven asset. 4. Inflation and monetary policy: If inflation remains high and central banks continue to raise interest rates, this could potentially boost silver prices as a hedge against inflation. 5. Geopolitical tensions: Ongoing conflicts or new geopolitical issues could drive investors towards safe-haven assets like silver. 6. Supply and demand: Any significant disruptions in silver mining or increased industrial demand could push prices higher. 7. Strength of the US dollar: Silver is priced in USD, so a weaker dollar could lead to higher silver prices. While there are factors that could push silver prices higher, reaching and sustaining a price above $30.50 by August 2024 would require a significant and sustained rally. The specific timing (4pm on August 9th, 2024) adds another layer of uncertainty. Given these factors, I believe there's a chance for silver to reach this price, but it's not highly probable.

Importance of the event: City Council meetings are typically important events for mayors to attend, especially open forums where citizens can voice their concerns. 2. Advance notice: The question is posed about 20 days before the event, which gives ample time for the mayor to plan his schedule. 3. Regular attendance: Mayors generally make it a priority to attend city council meetings unless there are conflicting engagements or emergencies. 4. Flexibility of attendance: The question allows for both physical and virtual (Zoom) attendance, which increases the likelihood of the mayor's participation. 5. Potential conflicts: Without specific information about conflicting events or the mayor's typical attendance record, we can't factor in personal schedule conflicts. 6. Political implications: Regular attendance at such meetings is often seen as a sign of engagement and commitment to the community, which is politically beneficial. 7. Time of year: Late July is typically not a major holiday period, so there's less chance of the mayor being away on vacation. 8.

Marvel's history of celebrity cameos: The Marvel Cinematic Universe often includes surprise cameos and celebrity appearances, which aligns with their style. 3. Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Swift's friendship: Ryan Reynolds, who plays Deadpool, is known to be friends with Taylor Swift, which could increase the likelihood of her involvement. 4. Swift's previous acting experience: She has appeared in films before, including 'Valentine's Day' and 'Cats,' showing her willingness to take on acting roles. 5. The character Dazzler: In Marvel comics, Dazzler is a mutant pop star, which seems like a perfect fit for Swift. There have been rumors and fan theories about her potentially playing this role. 6. Swift's busy schedule: As a highly successful musician, her availability for film projects might be limited. 7. Lack of official confirmation: As of now, there's no official announcement or confirmation of her involvement in the film. 8. The broad definition of a cameo in the question: The resolution criteria include even just her voice being used, which increases the chances of a 'YES' resolution. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to good chance of Taylor Swift making some form of appearance in the film. The friendship with Ryan Reynolds, the potential fit for the Dazzler character, and Marvel's love for surprise cameos all point towards this possibility.

Current status: As of July 2024, Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election. There have been no recent indications of him considering dropping out. 3. Health concerns: Biden is 81 years old, making him the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. While his age has been a topic of discussion, there have been no recent reports of severe health issues that would force him to drop out suddenly. 4. Political landscape: The Democratic Party has largely rallied behind Biden as their candidate. A last-minute dropout would be highly disruptive to the party's election strategy. 5. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for a sitting president to drop out of a re-election race, especially this close to the election. 6. Commitment to the race: Biden and his team have consistently expressed their commitment to running for re-election. 7. Unforeseen circumstances: While unlikely, there's always a small chance of unexpected events (such as a sudden health crisis or a major scandal) that could force Biden to drop out.

Shyamalan's overall career: He's known for his twist endings and unique storytelling, which often divide critics. His films tend to have mixed reviews, with some being well-received and others poorly received. 3. Genre and premise: 'Trap' is described as a psychological thriller set during a concert. Shyamalan has had success with thrillers in the past, which could work in the film's favor. 4. Critical reception trends: There's been a slight trend towards more favorable reviews for Shyamalan's recent work, possibly due to a combination of improved filmmaking and adjusted expectations from critics. 5. Production quality: Shyamalan's films typically have high production values, which can positively influence critics' opinions. 6. Cast: The film stars Josh Hartnett, who has been in critically acclaimed projects recently. A strong cast performance could boost the film's reception. 7. Shyamalan's growth as a filmmaker: He's been in the industry for decades and may have learned from past criticisms, potentially leading to improved storytelling. Given these factors, I believe 'Trap' has a decent chance of reaching the 60% threshold on Rotten Tomatoes. The upward trend in his recent work is encouraging, and the thriller genre suits his strengths. However, Shyamalan's films remain somewhat unpredictable in terms of critical reception.

This can provide a slight advantage, but its impact is minimal in All-Star games. 4. Recent MLB season performance: The overall strength of each league can influence the outcome. However, this can be hard to predict far in advance. 5. Randomness: Despite the AL's historical dominance, each individual game is subject to chance. The All-Star Game is just one game, which increases the role of randomness. 6. Motivation: Both teams are typically equally motivated to win, as the game is largely for entertainment and showcasing talent. Given the AL's strong historical performance, especially in recent years, they should be considered the favorites. However, the gap isn't overwhelming, and upsets can and do happen in single-game events like this. Considering all these factors, I would estimate that the AL has a higher chance of winning, but not overwhelmingly so."}, "prob": 0.6}, "prob": 0.6, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.737, "brier_score": 0.16, "brier_score_scaled": 36.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.403, "brier_score": 0.3564, "brier_score_scaled": -42.6, "log_score": 1.311}}

This significantly reduces the likelihood of any major changes occurring. 2. Current status: As of the creation date (July 8, 2024), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election. There have been no recent indications or reports suggesting he's considering dropping out. 3. Political climate: Dropping out this close to the election (which would be about 4 months away) would be extremely unusual and potentially catastrophic for the Democratic Party. It would leave them with very little time to select and promote a new candidate. 4. Biden's health: While concerns about Biden's age and health have been raised throughout his presidency, there haven't been any recent major health scares that would suggest an imminent departure. 5. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election campaign, especially this close to the election. The last time this happened was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, and that was much earlier in the election cycle. 6. Commitment to the role: Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election and has not shown any signs of wavering from this position.

Stage of the tournament: Semi-finals are high-stakes matches where teams might be more cautious, potentially reducing the likelihood of reckless challenges. However, the pressure and intensity could also lead to more heated moments and potential misconduct. 3. Duration: The question covers two matches, which increases the chances of a red card occurring compared to a single match. 4. Definition of red card: The question includes both direct red cards and second yellow cards, which broadens the possibilities for a red card to be shown. 5. Inclusion of support team: The question also includes members of the support team, which slightly increases the chances, although red cards for non-players are very rare. 6. Referee tendencies: Some referees are more prone to showing red cards than others, but we don't know who will be officiating these matches. 7. Teams involved: We don't know which teams will reach the semi-finals, but some teams historically play more aggressively or are more disciplined than others. Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of seeing a red card in either of the semi-finals.

Competition level: The International Championship is likely to be more challenging than the national level, with top performers from various countries participating. The competition will be fiercer, potentially reducing your chances compared to the national level. 3. Number of medals available: Typically, international competitions offer gold, silver, and bronze medals, sometimes in multiple categories. This increases the chances of earning a medal compared to if only gold was offered. 4. Time frame: The championship lasts for 9 days (July 13th to 21st), which is a substantial period. This suggests a comprehensive competition with multiple rounds or events, potentially increasing your chances of excelling in at least one area. 5. Language factor: The Chinese national championship was conducted in English, and the international event is in Austria. This suggests you're comfortable competing in English, which is likely the language of the international competition, eliminating any potential language barrier. 6. Preparation time: You have about a week from the time of asking (July 5th) until the competition starts (July 13th). This gives you some time for final preparations, which could be beneficial. 7. Unknown factors: We don't know how many competitors there will be, your specific strengths and weaknesses in geography, or the exact format of the competition, which adds uncertainty to the prediction. Given your success at the national level, your comfort with English-language competitions, and the multiple medal opportunities, you have a good chance of earning a medal.

General polling trends: Public opinion polls have consistently shown Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, while other Democrats poll ahead or within the margin of error against Trump. This suggests that Biden is currently a weaker candidate than a generic Democrat. 2. Manifold respondents vs. general public: The question asks if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. While we don't have specific data on Manifold users' demographics or political leanings, we can assume that they might be more politically engaged and informed than the average voter. This could potentially lead to some differences in their voting preferences compared to the general public. 3. The 3% threshold: The question specifically asks if Trump will gain at least 3% more votes when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat. This is a significant margin, especially considering that elections are often decided by smaller margins. 4. Short timeframe: The polls close on July 6, which is only a few days from the creation date of this question (July 4). This short timeframe limits the potential for major shifts in opinion or new events that could significantly impact the results. 5. Engaged audience: Manifold users are likely to be more aware of current polling trends and political dynamics. This awareness might lead them to reflect the broader trend of Biden performing worse against Trump compared to a generic Democrat. Given these factors, it seems likely that Trump would perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. The consistent polling showing Biden as a weaker candidate is likely to be reflected in the Manifold community's responses. However, the 3% threshold is quite high, and it's not certain that the difference will be that large.

Vice President Kamala Harris: If Biden were to step down, Harris would be a likely successor, which could increase the chances of a female nominee. However, this scenario remains speculative and unlikely. 7. Public opinion: While there is growing support for female leadership in politics, there isn't a strong public push for a female nominee that would override support for the incumbent.

Historically, incumbent presidents rarely face serious primary challenges or participate in primary debates. 2.

Time frame: The question was created on July 2, 2024, and the resolution date is August 12, 2024. This leaves a relatively short window for a debate to be organized and held, especially considering that the Democratic National Convention typically occurs in late August or early September. 4. Party unity: The Democratic Party is likely focused on presenting a united front against the Republican nominee rather than highlighting internal divisions through debates. 5. Potential for unexpected events: While unlikely, there's always a possibility of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., health issues, major political scandals) that could lead to last-minute challengers or debates. 6. Historical precedent: In recent elections with incumbent Democratic presidents (e.g., Obama in 2012, Clinton in 1996), there were no primary debates. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that there will be another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 convention. The incumbent advantage, lack of serious challengers, short time frame, and party's desire for unity all point towards a very low probability of a debate occurring.

This upward trend is significant and suggests that the 30% threshold could be reached soon. 2. Time frame: The question asks about the poll in July 2024, which is only one month after the June poll. Given the rapid pace of AI development, it's plausible that advancements could occur within this short timeframe. 3. Underestimation in previous markets: The description mentions that previous markets significantly underestimated Manifold's belief in AI progress. This suggests that there might be a tendency for faster progress than anticipated. 4. Lack of specific definition: The poll intentionally doesn't provide a strict definition of 'weak AGI,' allowing respondents to use their own understanding. This flexibility could lead to a higher percentage of positive responses as people may have varying thresholds for what constitutes weak AGI. 5. Ongoing AI developments: While we don't have specific information about AI advancements between June and July 2024, the field of AI is rapidly evolving, and breakthroughs can happen quickly. 6. Psychological factors: As more people become accustomed to advanced AI systems, there might be a gradual shift in perception about what constitutes weak AGI, potentially leading to more positive responses. Given these factors, especially the strong upward trend (from 15% to 27% in one month) and the closeness to the 30% threshold, it seems quite likely that the 30% mark will be reached or exceeded in July 2024.

Approval ratings: Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, which could potentially influence his decision to continue running. 4. Party support: Despite some concerns, the Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden's re-election bid. 5. Precedent: It is extremely rare for an incumbent president to decide not to seek re-election, especially after already announcing their intention to run. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely for a major party to be without a nominee so close to the convention. 7. No clear alternative: There isn't a clear alternative candidate who could step in if Biden were to withdraw, which makes it less likely for him to step aside. 8. Biden's commitment: Biden has consistently expressed his commitment to running again and has given no indication of reconsidering. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he will not accept the nomination before July 15, 2024. While there are some concerns about his age and approval ratings, the combination of his current active campaign, the party's support, the late date in the election cycle, and the lack of precedent for such a move all suggest that Biden is very likely to remain the Democratic nominee.

Director: Lee Isaac Chung is known for his critically acclaimed film 'Minari,' which received a 98% Rotten Tomatoes score. This suggests he has the ability to create well-received films. 2. Cast: Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar Jones are both rising stars with good reputations. Powell's performance in 'Top Gun: Maverick' (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and Edgar Jones' in 'Normal People' (91% on Rotten Tomatoes) were well-received. 3. Sequel factor: As a standalone sequel to the 1996 'Twister,' there's potential for both nostalgia and fresh storytelling. However, sequels often struggle to match the original's reception. The original 'Twister' has a 63% score, which is decent but not exceptional. 4. Genre: Disaster movies tend to be hit-or-miss with critics. They often prioritize spectacle over depth, which can lead to mixed reviews. 5. Studio involvement: Without more information about the studio's track record with similar films, it's hard to factor this in significantly. 6. Current trends: There's been a recent trend of well-received 'legacy sequels' (e.g., Top Gun: Maverick), which could work in the film's favor. 7. Time since original: The 28-year gap since the original allows for significant technological advancements in special effects, which could impress critics if used effectively. Given these factors, I believe 'Twisters' has a decent chance of being well-received, but reaching the 75% threshold is not guaranteed. The director's previous success and the cast's reputation are positive indicators, but the genre and sequel nature present challenges.

Historical performance: Ronaldo is one of the most prolific goalscorers in football history. He has consistently performed well in major tournaments, including previous European Championships. 2. Current form: As of 2023, Ronaldo is still playing at a high level, albeit in the Saudi Pro League. His goal-scoring ability remains impressive, even if he's not in one of Europe's top leagues. 3. Age factor: Ronaldo will be 39 years old during Euro 2024. While he has maintained excellent fitness throughout his career, age could potentially impact his performance. 4. Portugal's qualification and progression: For Ronaldo to have more opportunities to score, Portugal needs to qualify for the tournament and progress through the stages. Given Portugal's strong team, qualification is likely. 5. Playing time: Ronaldo's role in the national team may evolve, but given his status and experience, he's likely to feature prominently if fit. 6. Competition for places: Portugal has several talented forwards, which could affect Ronaldo's playing time. However, his experience and leadership make him a valuable asset. 7. Motivation: Euro 2024 could potentially be Ronaldo's last major international tournament, which might provide extra motivation to perform well. 8. Tournament format: The European Championship format typically allows for multiple matches, increasing the chances of scoring. 9. Ronaldo's role in set-pieces: He often takes free kicks and penalties, which provides additional goal-scoring opportunities. Considering these factors, while acknowledging that no outcome is certain in football, Ronaldo has a good chance of scoring at least one goal during Euro 2024. His track record, skill set, and the multiple opportunities he's likely to have over the course of the tournament all contribute to a favorable probability."}, "prob": 0.75}, "prob": 0.75, "resolution": false, "log_score": 2.0, "brier_score": 0.5625, "brier_score_scaled": -125.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.4449, "brier_score": 0.198, "brier_score_scaled": 20.8, "log_score": 0.8492}}

NASA and Boeing reliability: Both NASA and Boeing have a strong track record of adhering to mission schedules, especially when it comes to critical timeframes like this one. 3. Safety protocols: Given the importance of astronaut safety, it's highly unlikely that NASA or Boeing would risk extending the stay beyond the fuel limitations of the Harmony module. 4. Previous missions: While this is a relatively new spacecraft, NASA and Boeing have successfully completed other missions with strict timelines. 5. Potential technical issues: There's always a small chance of technical problems that could delay the departure, but given the critical nature of the fuel limitation, any issues would likely be addressed with urgency. 6. Buffer time: The 45-day limit gives some buffer for minor delays or issues, increasing the likelihood of meeting the July 21 deadline. 7. Public scrutiny: High-profile missions like this are under intense public and media scrutiny, which adds pressure to adhere to announced schedules. Considering all these factors, it seems highly likely that the Boeing Starliner will depart with the astronauts by July 21, 2024. The only significant risk would be a major unforeseen technical issue, which is possible but not probable given the preparation and testing that goes into such missions."}, "prob": 0.95}, "prob": 0.95, "resolution": false, "log_score": 4.3219, "brier_score": 0.9025, "brier_score_scaled": -261.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.769, "calibrated_prob": 0.4901, "brier_score": 0.2402, "brier_score_scaled": 3.9, "log_score": 0.9718}}

Regular publishing schedule: Shonen Jump typically publishes chapters weekly without breaks, unless there are specific reasons for a hiatus. 2. Author's health and workload: Breaks are sometimes scheduled to allow mangaka to rest or catch up on their work. However, we don't have specific information about the author's current situation. 3. Magazine breaks: Shonen Jump occasionally has magazine-wide breaks, usually around holidays. However, the resolution date (July 8, 2024) doesn't coincide with any major Japanese holidays. 4. Series popularity and status: Kagurabachi is a relatively new series (started in 2023). New series often try to maintain consistent publication to build readership, making breaks less likely unless absolutely necessary. 5. Previous break patterns: Without information about previous breaks in the series, it's difficult to predict if there's a pattern of regular breaks. 6. Lack of announced break: Usually, breaks are announced in advance. The question doesn't mention any such announcement, which suggests that a break is less likely. 7. Time frame: The question is specifically about the break between chapters 40 and 41, which is a very specific point in the series. Without any particular reason given for a break at this point, it seems less likely. Given these factors, and considering that the default state for manga publication is to continue without breaks unless there's a specific reason, it seems more likely that there won't be a break between chapters 40 and 41 of Kagurabachi.

Tournament strategy: Depending on their group stage schedule and opponents, Uruguay might strategically rotate players to keep key players fresh for later, more challenging matches. 5. Performance in the Panama match: If certain players underperformed against Panama, the coach might be inclined to make changes for the US match. 6. Injuries or suspensions: Any injuries or yellow/red cards from the Panama match could force changes in the lineup. 7.
