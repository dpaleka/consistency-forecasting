The U.S. maintains a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles through August 2024: Prolonged high tariffs on Chinese EVs could lead to shifts in global trade dynamics. Mexico, being a major trade partner with the U.S. and a significant player in the automotive industry, might experience increased demand for its vehicles or attract foreign investment.

AMLO's term ends in December 2024, with general elections scheduled for July 2024. The lead-up to elections often brings political maneuvering and potential shifts in power dynamics. If opposition parties gain more seats in the Senate during the elections, they might push for economic reforms contrary to AMLO's policies. - Potential Drivers for Economic Reform: - External Economic Pressures: The U.S. tariffs and shifts in trade may prompt calls for Mexico to adapt its economic policies to remain competitive. - Public Demand: Inspired by policy changes like New York's free community college, there could be increased public demand for reforms addressing education, social services, or economic inequality. - Economic Opportunities: To attract investment amid changing global trade patterns, some senators might advocate for reforms in taxation or fiscal spending, even if opposed by AMLO. - Challenges: - AMLO's Opposition: Given his strong influence, any major reform opposed by him would face significant obstacles. - Party Loyalty: Members of MORENA may be reluctant to support legislation that goes against the president's agenda. - Time Constraints: Passing major legislation takes time, and the period between the preconditions being met and August 31, 2024, is relatively short, especially with elections occurring in July."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "467814fd-6d55-4b68-aaca-f30321190fa8", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (1) New York implements a free community college plan by July 2024, (2) The United States maintains a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles through August 2024, and (3) Mexico's Senate passes a major economic reform bill opposed by President L\u00f3pez Obrador by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

Over the past several years, the index has generally fluctuated between 6,000 and 9,800 points. This suggests that reaching 10,000 points would be a significant move upward compared to recent years.\n\n2. **Required Increase**: From 9,300 points, reaching 10,000 points requires an approximate increase of 7.5%. Over 11 months, this equates to an average monthly growth rate of about 0.68%. While this growth rate is attainable, it assumes consistent positive performance without significant downturns.\n\n3. **Economic Factors**:\n   - **Domestic Economy**: Spain's economy has been recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Positive indicators include improving GDP growth, declining unemployment rates, and supportive fiscal policies.\n   - **European Context**: The European Central Bank (ECB) has been adjusting monetary policies to manage inflation and stimulate growth. Changes in interest rates and quantitative easing measures can affect equity markets.\n   - **Global Influences**: Global economic conditions, such as supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and energy prices, can impact investor sentiment and market performance.\n\n4. **Market Volatility**:\n   - Equity markets are subject to volatility. Intraday spikes due to earnings reports, political events, or unexpected news can temporarily push the index above key levels.\n   - Since intraday highs count for resolution, even a brief surge could satisfy the condition, increasing the probability.\n\n5. **Investor Sentiment**:\n   - Positive corporate earnings and optimistic outlooks can drive markets upward.\n   - Conversely, negative news or economic data can lead to market corrections.\n\n6. **Potential Catalysts**:\n   - **Positive Catalysts**: Successful implementation of economic reforms, increased foreign investment, or breakthroughs in key industries could boost the index.\n   - **Negative Catalysts**: Resurgence of pandemic-related issues, economic downturns, or adverse political developments could hinder growth.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nConsidering the required 7.5% increase over 11 months is achievable, especially with the possibility of intraday highs, there's a reasonable chance for the IBEX 35 to reach 10,000 points. However, the fact that it hasn't done so since 2015 suggests some resistance around that level.\n\nBalancing the optimistic economic recovery with potential risks and historical trends, I estimate the probability of the IBEX 35 reaching or exceeding 10,000 points by August 31, 2024, to be approximately **40%**."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "d6a38d58-e38b-40d7-b7c2-8cb287ccbce9", "title": "If Spain's IBEX 35 index reaches or exceeds 10,000 points by August 2024, will the Bank of Korea announce a reduction in its key interest rate by August 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Spain's IBEX 35 index reaches or exceeds 10,000 points at any moment between October 1, 2023, and August 31, 2024.

South Dakota's Political Climate and Gun Laws:\n\n- Strong Pro-Gun Culture: South Dakota is a predominantly conservative state with a strong culture of gun ownership and support for the Second Amendment. Hunting and firearm ownership are integral parts of the state's heritage and lifestyle.\n- Existing Gun Laws: The state has some of the most permissive gun laws in the United States, including permitless carry (both open and concealed carry without a permit). There have been recent moves to further protect gun rights rather than restrict them.\n- Political Leadership: The Republican Party dominates South Dakota's state government, holding the governorship and supermajorities in both legislative chambers. The party generally opposes increased gun control measures.\n\n2. Mechanisms for Referendums in South Dakota:\n\n- Initiated Measures and Referendums: South Dakota allows for citizen-initiated measures and referendums through petition drives. To qualify for the ballot, proponents must collect signatures from registered voters equal to 10% of the votes cast for governor in the last gubernatorial election.\n- Time Constraints: For initiated measures to appear on the 2024 ballot, signatures would typically need to be submitted by November 2023 (one year before the general election). Given that it's already October 2023, there is insufficient time to organize, gather signatures, and submit a petition unless efforts are already well underway, which there is no indication of.\n\n3. Impact of Virginia and Wisconsin Referendums:\n\n- Limited Influence: While Virginia and Wisconsin holding referendums on contentious issues might inspire political engagement elsewhere, the issues (abortion rights and electoral reform) are different and may not directly influence South Dakota's stance on gun control.\n- Regional Differences: The cultural and political contexts of Virginia and Wisconsin differ significantly from South Dakota. Policies and political movements in one state do not necessarily translate to others, especially when the states have different ideological leanings.\n\n4. Lack of Indications Toward Gun Control Referendum:\n\n- No Current Movements: As of October 2023, there are no significant grassroots movements, advocacy campaigns, or public outcry in South Dakota pushing for new or significantly altered gun control laws.\n- Historical Precedence: South Dakota has not historically pursued gun control through referendums. Previous ballot measures have focused on other issues like marijuana legalization and payday lending.\n\n5. Potential Unforeseen Events:\n\n- Triggering Events: Significant incidents involving gun violence could potentially shift public opinion. However, even if such an event occurred, organizing a referendum involves legal and logistical challenges that may not be surmountable within the limited time frame.\n- Legislative Action: The state legislature could propose a referendum, but given the political composition and pro-gun stance of the legislature, this is highly unlikely.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGiven the strong pro-gun culture, the lack of existing movements toward gun control, the political composition of the state government, and the logistical time constraints for organizing a referendum, it is extremely unlikely that South Dakota will hold a statewide referendum on gun control laws by July 31, 2024. The actions of Virginia and Wisconsin are unlikely to have a significant impact on this issue in South Dakota."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "acd8208c-8a57-4fc3-a3cb-5e95bb26cf4c", "title": "Will both of the following occur by August 2024: (a) Virginia and Wisconsin hold referendums on abortion rights and electoral reform, respectively, and (b) South Dakota holds a referendum on gun control laws?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if all of the following occur: (1) By July 31, 2024, Virginia officially conducts a statewide referendum specifically on the topic of enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution.

Regarding BT Group: - **Historical Context:** As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, BT Group has not publicly confirmed any payments to hackers to erase sensitive data. Generally, companies are reluctant to disclose such payments due to legal repercussions, fear of encouraging further attacks, and potential damage to their reputation. - **Cybersecurity Measures:** BT Group is known to invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect its infrastructure and customer data. While no system is entirely immune to cyber threats, companies of BT's stature typically have protocols to manage and mitigate attacks without resorting to paying hackers. - **Public Disclosure:** Even if a payment were made, public confirmation is unlikely unless required by regulatory authorities.

The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) is one of the most powerful and influential drug cartels in Mexico. Despite ongoing efforts by Mexican authorities and international cooperation to curb its activities, dismantling such a well-established organization within a limited timeframe is challenging. Historically, similar cartels have taken many years to weaken significantly, and even then, authorities are cautious in declaring them fully dismantled due to potential splinter groups or resurgence. Additionally, public declarations of complete dismantlement are rare, as they may be premature or strategic. Given these considerations, the probability of an official declaration meeting the specified criteria by July 31, 2024, is low. I estimate this probability at 5%. (b) Morgan Stanley issues pass-through certificates worth at least $1 billion by August 31, 2024. Morgan Stanley is a major global financial institution that regularly engages in significant financial transactions. Issuing pass-through certificates as part of loan sales is a common financial strategy to manage assets and liabilities. Given the scale of Morgan Stanley's operations, it is plausible that they might issue pass-through certificates totaling at least $1 billion within the next year. Market conditions, regulatory environments, and strategic corporate decisions will influence this likelihood. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability at 60%. (c) BT Group publicly confirms a payment to a hacker to erase sensitive data by July 31, 2024. BT Group, a leading telecommunications company, would be highly reluctant to publicly confirm paying a hacker. Such an admission could have severe legal, financial, and reputational repercussions. Companies typically avoid disclosing payments to hackers to prevent encouraging further attacks and to comply with legal obligations. Unless compelled by regulatory requirements or unavoidable circumstances, it is unlikely that BT Group would make such a confirmation. Therefore, I estimate the probability at 2%.

(b) By August 31, 2024, credible reports or official warnings state that a new AI platform is spreading election misinformation. Firstly, the Central Bank of South Korea decreasing its Base Rate is an economic measure intended to stimulate South Korea's economy by lowering borrowing costs. While South Korea is a significant player in the global economy, its monetary policy changes have limited direct impact on the Italian economy. There might be some indirect effects through global trade dynamics or investor sentiment, but these are likely to be minimal and not sufficient to substantially boost Italian employment figures. Secondly, the emergence of a new AI platform spreading election misinformation could raise global concerns about cybersecurity and information integrity. This may lead to increased investment in technology sectors focused on AI ethics, cybersecurity, and content moderation. Italy could benefit from such a global shift if Italian companies or the government invest in these areas, possibly creating new jobs. However, the scale of job creation in this sector within a short timeframe is unlikely to reach 100,000 jobs in a single month.

Implementing such a plan requires legislative action, budgeting, and administrative setup, which typically take significant time. Legislative Progress: There have been discussions at the federal level about making community college tuition-free, but those initiatives have stalled in Congress. At the state level, while some states like Tennessee and Oregon have implemented free community college programs, Pennsylvania has not made substantial moves in this direction recently. Time Constraints: With less than a year until July 31, 2024, and no existing legislation or announcements, it's unlikely that Pennsylvania will be able to design, pass, and implement a statewide program in time. Conclusion: The probability of Pennsylvania implementing a statewide free community college plan by the resolution date is low.\n\n(b) South Dakota holding a referendum on education reform: South Dakota does have provisions for statewide referenda, but they are not frequent, and the process requires time. Referendum Process: To hold a referendum, petitions must be filed, signatures collected, and the measure must be certified for the ballot. This process can take several months to over a year. Current Initiatives: As of October 2023, there are no known education reform referenda scheduled or significant movements pushing for one imminently. Election Dates: Statewide referenda are typically held during general elections, with the next major one expected in November 2024, after the resolution date. Conclusion: The likelihood of South Dakota conducting a statewide referendum on education reform by July 31, 2024, is very low.\n\n(c) Washington implementing a free community college plan: Washington state has shown interest in making higher education more accessible. Existing Programs: Washington offers the Washington College Grant, providing financial aid to low-income students, which can cover tuition at community colleges. Recent Developments: There have been discussions about expanding access, but no official announcements of a statewide free community college program have been made by October 2023.

Factors that could influence increased demand include new flavor releases, effective marketing campaigns, and general market growth in the snack sector.

Historical Employment Data: - The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) regularly reports on employment figures. - Historically, Brazil's job market has experienced significant monthly fluctuations. - During periods of economic growth or recovery, it's not uncommon for Brazil to add over 200,000 jobs in a single month. - For example, after recessions or during periods of economic stimulus, job creation can surge. 2. Current Economic Conditions (as of October 2023): - Brazil's economy has been showing signs of moderate growth. - Key sectors like agriculture, mining, and services are performing steadily. - Inflation rates are within the target range set by the Central Bank, promoting economic stability. - The government has implemented policies to stimulate investment and consumer spending. 3. Economic Forecasts: - Analysts predict continued modest growth for Brazil through 2024. - No major economic downturns are anticipated in the global economy that would significantly impact Brazil. - Infrastructure projects and government programs may boost employment in certain months. 4. Seasonal Employment Trends: - Certain times of the year, such as the lead-up to the holiday season, often see increases in employment due to higher demand in retail and services. - Agricultural cycles can also affect employment numbers, with planting and harvesting seasons requiring more labor. 5. External Factors: - The condition involving Union Pacific and the train engineers' union in the United States is unlikely to have any direct impact on Brazil's employment figures. - Thus, the event is effectively independent, and we can assess Brazil's job growth without factoring in this condition. 6.

Google announces an increase in its AI-related workforce by July 31, 2024. 2. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate in the U.S. exceeds 7.0% during August 2024. 1. Google's AI Workforce Increase: Google's expansion in AI reflects developments in the technology sector, primarily impacting the tech industry in the United States and globally. While advancements in AI can influence global markets, there is no direct link between Google's hiring decisions and the European Union's trade policies, especially concerning tariffs on Japanese EVs. 2. U.S. Mortgage Rates Exceeding 7.0%: A rise in U.S. mortgage rates signifies changes in the U.S. economy, such as inflationary pressures or adjustments in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. While global economic conditions can have ripple effects, the U.S. mortgage rates do not have a direct causal relationship with the EU's trade decisions regarding Japan. EU-Japan Trade Relations: Existing Trade Agreements: The EU and Japan have a strong trade relationship, highlighted by the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) implemented in 2019, which reduces tariffs and fosters economic cooperation. This agreement aims to facilitate trade rather than impose new barriers, making the introduction of a high tariff less likely. Lack of Trade Disputes: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there were no significant trade disputes between the EU and Japan concerning electric vehicles. Imposing a 50% tariff is a drastic measure typically reserved for severe trade conflicts, such as allegations of dumping or unfair trade practices. Market Dynamics: Competition with Other Countries: The EU has shown concerns over imports of EVs from countries with substantial government subsidies impacting fair competition, notably China. However, Japan does not fall into this category, and Japanese automakers are long-standing partners in the European market. Regulatory and Environmental Policies: The EU is promoting the adoption of EVs to meet environmental targets. Imposing high tariffs on Japanese EVs could slow down EV adoption by reducing consumer choices and potentially increasing prices.

The Seventh Replenishment Conference occurred in September 2022, setting funding for 2023-2025.\n   - Mid-cycle, the Global Fund may still receive additional commitments, especially in response to emerging global health needs or initiatives.\n   - Historically, significant additional funding commitments outside the regular replenishment cycles are less common but not unprecedented.\n\n4. **Potential Catalysts for New Funding Commitments:**\n   - Global health emergencies or new initiatives (e.g., outbreaks of infectious diseases, innovative health programs) could prompt additional funding.\n   - International events, summits, or campaigns raising awareness about health issues may lead to new commitments.\n   - If there is a compelling reason, donors might pledge substantial amounts even outside the normal funding cycle.\n\n5. **Correlation Between the S&P/TSX Index and Global Fund Commitments:**\n   - While there is no direct causation, a strong Canadian economy (as indicated by the S&P/TSX index) could indirectly impact funding decisions.\n   - However, the link is tenuous, and many other factors influence funding commitments, including political priorities, global health needs, and international relations.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - Given the conditionality of the S&P/TSX reaching 22,000 points, which is plausible, the main uncertainty lies in whether the Global Fund will announce new funding over $400 million by July 2024.\n   - Considering the factors above, there is a moderate likelihood but not a strong expectation of such an announcement.\n   - The probability is somewhat increased due to potential positive economic conditions but tempered by the infrequency of large funding announcements outside regular cycles."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "e390719f-b5a9-4856-880c-5ea3b7dc232e", "title": "Given both Canada's S&P/TSX Composite index reaches or exceeds 22,000 points by August 2024 and the Global Fund announces new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024, will Sears Holdings emerge from bankruptcy by July 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: (a) Canada's S&P/TSX Composite index reaches or exceeds 22,000 points at any time between October 1, 2023, and August 31, 2024, based on official reports from providers such as Bloomberg or the Toronto Stock Exchange, with intraday highs counting for resolution.

While significant for Virginia and potentially influential in U.S. policy circles, it is unlikely to have a direct impact on the European Union's trade policies.\n   - The EU formulates its trade policies based on its own economic interests, regulatory standards, and geopolitical considerations. A state referendum in the U.S. does not typically influence EU decisions.\n\n2. PayPal's AI-Focused Layoffs:\n   - PayPal's layoffs indicate a restructuring within a major fintech company, possibly reflecting trends in the technology sector such as automation and AI integration.\n   - While this may have implications for the global tech industry and labor markets, it does not have a direct causal relationship with the EU's trade policy towards China, particularly in the solar panel sector.\n   - However, if the layoffs were part of a broader shift affecting EU tech companies or if they signaled economic trends that concern the EU, there might be indirect considerations, but this link is tenuous.\n\nEU-China Trade Relations and Solar Panels:\n\n- Historical Context:\n  - The EU previously imposed anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese solar panels from 2013 to 2018 due to concerns about Chinese manufacturers selling below market value and harming European producers.\n  - In 2018, the EU decided not to renew these tariffs to lower the cost of solar energy and support its renewable energy goals.\n\n- Current Trends (as of October 2023):\n  - There is ongoing concern in the EU about dependence on Chinese technology and supply chains, leading to discussions about diversifying suppliers and supporting domestic industries.\n  - The EU is committed to ambitious climate goals, necessitating affordable access to solar technology. Imposing high tariffs could increase costs and slow down renewable energy adoption.\n  - Trade tensions exist but are often balanced against economic interests and the potential for retaliation.\n\n- Potential Reasons for Tariff Implementation:\n  - Trade Disputes: If new evidence emerges of unfair trade practices by Chinese solar panel manufacturers, the EU might consider tariffs.\n  - Geopolitical Factors: Significant geopolitical events or security concerns could prompt the EU to take protective measures.\n  - Industrial Policy: Efforts to boost EU domestic solar panel production could lead to protective tariffs, but such a high tariff (50% or more) would be unprecedented in recent times.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- The occurrence of the two specified conditions does not significantly increase the likelihood of the EU imposing such a tariff.\n- Without direct causation or strong correlation between these events and EU trade policy, the probability remains low.\n- Unless there are major developments in EU-China relations or significant issues in the solar panel market arising after October 2023, it is unlikely that the EU will implement a tariff of 50% or higher on Chinese solar panels by the specified date."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "10e4cbe1-5cbf-4c9f-b75f-cb7f937a3be2", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) Virginia hold a referendum on privacy rights by August 2024, (b) PayPal lay off at least 1,800 employees by July 2024, and (c) the European Commission implement a significant tariff on Chinese-made solar panels by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if all of the following conditions are met: (a) By August 31, 2024, Virginia officially conducts a public referendum specifically focused on privacy rights.

However, the U.S. Treasury Department is not typically the agency responsible for student loan policies; this role primarily falls under the U.S. Department of Education.

The company's workforce has been significantly reduced from about 7,500 employees to an estimated 2,000 employees due to various rounds of layoffs. While there have been reports of Twitter showing interest in artificial intelligence technologies, including hiring AI talent and investing in AI projects, there has been no official announcement of an AI-focused reorganization plan involving additional layoffs. Given the already reduced workforce, laying off at least 1,800 more employees would be challenging unless the company has rehired a substantial number of staff since the last reported figures. Additionally, any major reorganization plans would likely be publicized due to their impact.

Given the economic environment and the possibility of policy adjustments to manage inflation, there is a moderate chance that the Central Bank may announce a new inflation target by August 31, 2024. Such a change would be significant and would likely be communicated officially and reported by major financial news outlets. Estimated Probability for (b): 50%. (c) PepsiCo reporting increased North American demand for Doritos: Doritos is one of PepsiCo's most popular snack brands in North America. Snack food consumption tends to remain stable or grow slightly over time due to consistent consumer demand. Factors such as new product launches, marketing campaigns, or shifts in consumer preferences can influence sales positively. Assuming there are no adverse market conditions or significant shifts in consumer behavior, it is reasonable to expect that PepsiCo could report an increase in North American demand for Doritos compared to the second quarter of 2023 by July 31, 2024. Economic recovery trends and continued interest in snack foods support this expectation. Estimated Probability for (c): 70%.

However, the direct effect on Ford is likely limited. Unless these layoffs lead to a broader economic downturn affecting consumer confidence and spending, they are unlikely to significantly impact Ford's net income. **Impact on Ford's Net Income**: - **Automotive Industry Trends**: Ford's net income is more directly affected by factors such as vehicle demand, production costs, supply chain stability, and competitive dynamics in the automotive industry. Key challenges in recent years have included semiconductor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and the shift toward electric vehicles (EVs). - **Electric Vehicle Transition**: Ford has been investing heavily in EVs, which could boost revenues in the long term but may compress margins in the short term due to high R&D and capital expenditures. - **Economic Conditions**: Macroeconomic factors like interest rates, inflation, and consumer spending power play a significant role in vehicle sales. If the economy remains stable or improves by mid-2024, this could bolster Ford's sales and profitability. - **Year-over-Year Comparisons**: Achieving a net income increase of over 20% year-over-year in any quarter is substantial.

Likelihood of the Conditional Events Occurring: - WHO Declaring Mpox in Africa No Longer a Global Emergency: *Current Status:* As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the mpox (monkeypox) outbreak had been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the WHO in July 2022 due to its rapid global spread. *Trend Analysis:* Since then, there have been concerted global efforts to contain the outbreak, including vaccination campaigns and public health interventions. If these efforts are successful, it's plausible that the WHO might lift the global emergency status for mpox in Africa by August 2024. *Conclusion:* There is a moderate probability that this event will occur. - FDA Approving MDMA for Parkinson's Disease: *Current Research:* MDMA is primarily known for its potential therapeutic use in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As of 2023, it is in Phase 3 clinical trials for PTSD treatment. *MDMA and Parkinson's Disease:* There is limited to no significant clinical research indicating that MDMA is being studied for Parkinson's disease treatment. The drug development and approval process involves extensive clinical trials (Phase 1-3) and regulatory reviews, typically spanning several years. *Regulatory Hurdles:* Given the lack of substantial clinical evidence and ongoing trials specific to Parkinson's disease, it's highly unlikely that the FDA would approve MDMA for this indication by August 2024. *Conclusion:* The probability of this event occurring is very low. 2. Probability of the WHO Declaring COVID-19 in the Middle East No Longer a Global Emergency: - *Current Status of COVID-19:* In May 2023, the WHO declared that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a global health emergency. The focus has shifted to managing COVID-19 as an endemic disease, with attention to regional variations in outbreak severity. - *COVID-19 in the Middle East:* While the Middle East, like other regions, has experienced waves of COVID-19 infections, there has been no indication that the WHO considers the Middle East's situation as a separate global emergency distinct from the overall pandemic. - *WHO's Declaration Practices:* The WHO typically issues global declarations rather than region-specific global emergencies. It is uncommon for the WHO to declare a global emergency for a specific region unless the health event is confined and poses significant international concern. - *Likelihood of Specific Declaration:* Given the above, it's unlikely that the WHO would make a specific declaration about the COVID-19 outbreak in the Middle East being no longer a global emergency because such a specific emergency status may not have been declared in the first place. - *Impact of Conditional Events:* The two conditional events (mpox declaration and FDA approval) are not directly related to the COVID-19 situation in the Middle East. Therefore, their occurrence does not significantly influence the probability of the WHO making the specific COVID-19 declaration. 3. Interdependencies and External Factors: - *Global Health Trends:* Any significant changes in global health policies or unexpected developments (such as new variants) could influence the WHO's decisions, but these are unpredictable. - *Policy Shifts:* If the WHO adopts new practices in issuing region-specific declarations, this could affect the outcome, but there is no current evidence to suggest such a shift. **Probability Assessment:** Considering the unlikelihood of the FDA approving MDMA for Parkinson's disease by August 2024 and the low probability of the WHO issuing a specific declaration about the COVID-19 situation in the Middle East, the overall probability of the question resolving as YES is low. **Probability:** 0.10"}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "d34b334f-b4d7-4cb7-88c4-daf05acaf451", "title": "Will all of the following occur by August 2024: (a) The WHO declares the mpox outbreak in Africa no longer a global emergency, (b) The FDA approves MDMA as a therapy for Parkinson's disease, and (c) The WHO declares the COVID-19 outbreak in the Middle East no longer a global emergency?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if all of the following conditions are met by August 31, 2024:\n\n1.

The FDA approves MDMA as a therapy for Parkinson's disease:\n   - Current Status: As of October 2023, MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has reported promising results, and FDA approval for PTSD treatment may occur in the near future.\n   - MDMA for Parkinson's Disease: There is minimal to no clinical research investigating MDMA as a therapy for Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons, leading to motor control issues. Current treatments focus on dopamine replacement and managing symptoms.\n   - Regulatory Hurdles: FDA approval requires extensive clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy for the specific condition.

The direct impact of such regulatory curbs would primarily influence Axis Bank's operations and potentially the Indian banking industry to some extent.\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite index, however, is a U.S.-based stock market index that is heavily weighted towards the technology sector and includes all NASDAQ-listed stocks.

However, for the sake of this prediction, we are to assume that the listeria outbreak investigation concludes by July 31, 2024.\n\nFactors to Consider:\n\n1. Rift Valley Fever Outbreaks:\n   - Duration and Control: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans. Outbreaks are often associated with heavy rainfall and flooding, leading to increased mosquito populations. Historically, RVF outbreaks can last several months to over a year, depending on climatic conditions and the effectiveness of control measures.\n   - Severity Required for Global Emergency: The WHO declares a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for events that pose a significant risk to international public health. RVF has not commonly reached this level in past outbreaks, suggesting that an outbreak severe enough to warrant a PHEIC would be unusually serious and potentially more challenging to control quickly.\n\n2. WHO Declarations and Response Times:\n   - Process of Lifting an Emergency: Once a PHEIC is declared, lifting it involves a thorough assessment of the situation to ensure that the threat has been adequately mitigated. This process can be time-consuming, often extending beyond the immediate control of the outbreak.\n   - Historical Precedents: Previous PHEIC situations like the Ebola outbreaks and COVID-19 pandemic remained under emergency status for extended periods, reflecting the cautious approach of the WHO in declaring an event over.\n\n3. Interdependence of Events:\n   - Relation Between the Two Outbreaks: There is no direct causal relationship between the conclusion of the listeria outbreak investigation and the status of the RVF outbreak. The resolution of one does not inherently impact the other.\n   - Simultaneous Health Responses: Health authorities may be dealing with multiple outbreaks simultaneously, but resource allocation and global attention can influence response effectiveness.\n\n4. Time Frame Considerations:\n   - One-Month Window: The period between July 31 and August 31, 2024, is only one month. Even if significant progress is made, it may be optimistic to expect the WHO to officially declare the RVF outbreak no longer a global emergency within this short window.\n   - Reporting and Confirmation Delays: Official declarations require validation and are typically reported through multiple channels, which can introduce delays.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGiven the historical patterns of RVF outbreaks, the cautious approach of the WHO in lifting PHEIC statuses, and the short time frame between the two dates, it is unlikely that the WHO will declare the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa no longer a global emergency by August 31, 2024."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "6917fc29-1dfd-4a28-ac1c-07504097584c", "title": "Conditional on both the listeria outbreak investigation involving Oscar Mayer concluding by July 2024 and the WHO declaring the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa no longer a global emergency by August 2024, will Brazil close its investigation into Merck's diabetes drug pricing by July 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following two conditions are met:\n\n1.

Downside Risks: If global economic conditions deteriorate, leading to reduced demand for Malaysian exports, or if there is a significant slowdown in China (one of Malaysia's key trading partners), Malaysia might face economic headwinds. In such a scenario, BNM could consider cutting the OPR to stimulate economic activity.\n\n2. Domestic Challenges: Should Malaysia experience unforeseen domestic challenges such as political instability, natural disasters, or a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, economic growth could be impacted, prompting a potential rate cut.\n\n3. Stable Growth Scenario: If the economy continues to grow steadily with manageable inflation, BNM is likely to maintain the current OPR to balance between supporting growth and containing inflation.\n\nConclusion: Considering the current economic conditions and the balance of risks, the likelihood of BNM announcing a reduction in its key interest rate by August 31, 2024, is moderate but not high. While there are downside risks that could prompt a rate cut, BNM may prefer to keep rates steady unless there is a significant shift in economic indicators."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "9778da86-737b-4a75-89a8-62fe767b3d70", "title": "Given the Central Bank of Malaysia announces a reduction in its key interest rate by August 2024, will Apple announce measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption by July 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The Central Bank of Malaysia publicly announces a reduction in its key interest rate by August 31, 2024.

In recent times, many central banks have been increasing interest rates to combat rising inflation due to pandemic recovery and global supply chain disruptions.\nHowever, economic forecasts suggest that by mid to late 2024, global inflation may begin to stabilize, and some central banks might consider rate cuts to stimulate growth if economies show signs of slowing down. Malaysia's economy is export-oriented and sensitive to global demand. If global economic conditions weaken, there's a possibility that the Central Bank may reduce the OPR to support domestic growth.\nGiven these factors, there's a moderate probability that the Central Bank of Malaysia will announce a rate cut by August 2024.

Condition 1: By July 31, 2024, at least one U.S. state other than Georgia officially adopts a Medicaid plan that includes a work requirement for beneficiaries. Background: Medicaid work requirements have been a contentious issue in U.S. healthcare policy. The Trump administration allowed states to implement work requirements, but the Biden administration has generally opposed them, rescinding approvals in several states. Current Developments: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Georgia implemented its Pathways to Coverage program with work requirements. Other states like Arkansas and Wisconsin have shown interest in the past. Legal Challenges: Courts have previously struck down Medicaid work requirements, citing that they reduce access to healthcare. Assessment: Given the political climate and potential legal hurdles, it's moderately unlikely but still possible that another state might adopt such a plan by July 2024. Estimated Probability for Condition 1: 20%. Condition 2: By August 31, 2024, Missouri officially conducts a public referendum specifically focused on voting rights. Background: Missouri has engaged in debates over voting laws, including voter ID requirements and the initiative petition process. Current Developments: There have been discussions about making it harder to amend the state constitution via ballot initiatives, which could prompt advocacy groups to push for a referendum. Timing Constraints: Organizing a statewide referendum requires significant time for petitioning, approval, and campaigning. Assessment: As there are no announced plans as of October 2023, and considering the logistical challenges, it's somewhat unlikely that such a referendum will occur by August 2024. Estimated Probability for Condition 2: 15%. Condition 3: By August 31, 2024, North Carolina's current abortion law permitting abortions up to 20 weeks remains in effect without any changes. Background: In 2023, North Carolina passed a law restricting abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, which went into effect on July 1, 2023. This replaced the previous 20-week limit. Current Law: As of October 2023, the law permits abortions up to 12 weeks, not 20 weeks. Potential for Change: For this condition to be met, North Carolina would need to reverse the recent law and reinstate the 20-week limit before August 2024, then maintain it without changes. Assessment: Given the recent enactment of the 12-week limit and the political composition of the state legislature, it's highly improbable that the law will revert to a 20-week limit in the given timeframe.

Probability of Nevada Enacting Legislation Restricting Non-Firearm Weapons - Legislative Sessions: Nevada's legislature meets biennially in odd-numbered years. The next regular session after 2023 would be in 2025. However, special sessions can be called by the Governor or by a two-thirds majority in both legislative houses. - Historical Context: Nevada has a history of relatively permissive weapon laws, influenced by its Western frontier heritage and a strong culture of individual liberties. - Current Trends: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there have been no significant movements or public pressures in Nevada targeting non-firearm weapons like bladed weapons for increased regulation. - Political Climate: The Nevada legislature has a Democratic majority, and the Governor is also a Democrat. While Democrats may be more inclined toward weapon regulations, their focus has predominantly been on firearms rather than non-firearm weapons. Estimate: Given the lack of existing momentum and the legislative calendar constraints, I estimate a 15% probability that Nevada will enact such legislation by August 31, 2024. 2. Probability of Wisconsin Enacting a New Law Modifying Restrictions on Medical Care for Transgender Youth - Legislative Sessions: Wisconsin's legislature meets annually. Bills can be introduced and passed in both even and odd-numbered years. - Historical Context: In recent years, several states have considered or passed laws affecting medical care for transgender youth, either restricting or protecting access to gender-affirming treatments. - Current Trends: As of October 2023, Wisconsin has seen proposals both supporting and opposing transgender rights, reflecting national debates. - Political Climate: Wisconsin has a Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, and a Republican-controlled legislature. This split government can lead to legislative gridlock. - Republican Legislature: May be more inclined to introduce and pass legislation restricting medical care for transgender youth. - Democratic Governor: Likely to veto legislation that restricts transgender rights. - Override Possibility: Overriding a veto requires a two-thirds majority, which may be challenging to achieve. - Public Opinion: Wisconsin is a battleground state with evenly split public opinion, which may affect legislative priorities and actions. Estimate: Considering the political dynamics and recent national trends, I estimate a 25% probability that Wisconsin will enact new legislation modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 31, 2024. 3.

The country has experienced recurring outbreaks due to factors like close contact with wildlife reservoirs, population movement, and limited healthcare infrastructure.\n- **Recent Trends:** While mpox saw a global surge in 2022, international efforts have been implemented to control its spread. Vaccination campaigns and public health interventions have been intensified.\n- **Feasibility:** Declaring an outbreak over typically requires a period with no new cases (e.g., 42 days, which is twice the incubation period).

A federal judge in Texas blocked this rule, citing legal challenges.\n- **Legal Process:** The reinstatement of the rule would require either a successful appeal overturning the judge's decision or modifications to the rule addressing legal concerns.

Wisconsin Referendum on Abortion Rights by July 31, 2024: Current Status: Wisconsin has been grappling with abortion laws, especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The state's 1849 abortion ban has come under legal challenge, and there is significant public debate on the issue. Legislative Process: For a constitutional amendment to reach a public referendum in Wisconsin, it must be approved by two successive legislatures and then presented to the voters. This process typically takes a considerable amount of time. Political Landscape: The Wisconsin legislature is controlled by Republicans, who have generally opposed efforts to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution. There have been no significant moves indicating that such a referendum will be scheduled by July 2024. Conclusion: Given the time-consuming legislative process and the current political landscape, the likelihood of Wisconsin holding a referendum on abortion rights by the specified date is low. 2. Wisconsin Referendum on Electoral Reform by August 31, 2024: Current Status: Electoral reform is a topic of interest in Wisconsin, with discussions on issues like redistricting and voting laws. However, there have been no concrete steps toward holding a statewide referendum specifically on electoral reform. Legislative Process: Similar to the abortion rights amendment, any constitutional changes require approval in two consecutive legislative sessions. Political Landscape: Partisan divisions may hinder the progress of any electoral reform initiatives reaching a referendum stage by August 2024. Conclusion: The chances of a referendum on electoral reform occurring by the specified date are low due to procedural requirements and political factors. 3. Indiana Referendum on Tax Reform by August 31, 2024: Current Status: Indiana does not commonly use referendums to enact state policy changes. Tax reform discussions are prevalent, but there are no indications of an upcoming referendum. Legislative Process: Indiana requires a constitutional amendment to be approved by two consecutive legislatures before going to voters, similar to Wisconsin. Political Landscape: There is no significant movement or legislative action suggesting that a tax reform referendum is imminent. Conclusion: It is highly unlikely that Indiana will hold a referendum on tax reform by the specified date. Combined Probability: Given that all three events need to occur for the overall question to resolve as YES, we need to consider the joint probability.

This law prohibits most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detectable, which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy. The law has faced legal challenges since its inception, but it remains enforceable.\n\nLegal Challenges:\n\n1. State Court Proceedings: Legal challenges to the law have been made on the grounds that it violates the Georgia Constitution. In 2022, the Georgia Supreme Court allowed the law to remain in effect while litigation proceeded. Given the conservative leaning of the Georgia judiciary and the prior decisions upholding the law, it is less likely that state courts will overturn the ban by July 31, 2024.\n\n2. Federal Court Intervention: After the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in June 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade, federal courts are less likely to strike down state abortion laws. This reduces the probability of a federal court invalidating Georgia's law within the specified timeframe.\n\n3. Duration of Legal Processes: Legal cases, especially those that might reach higher courts, can take extended periods to resolve. Considering the time required for appeals and potential delays, a definitive court ruling overturning the law by July 31, 2024 is uncertain.\n\nLegislative Action:\n\n1.

California's Medicaid Work Requirement Removal: The removal of the work requirement from California's Medicaid plan is unlikely to have a direct impact on Georgia's abortion law. Medicaid policies in one state do not typically influence abortion legislation in another state, especially given the differing political climates.\n\n2.

For jobless claims to exceed 300,000 for three consecutive weeks, there would typically need to be a significant economic downturn or recession. While there are ongoing concerns about inflation and potential economic slowdown due to various factors (e.g., interest rate hikes, global events), there are no definitive indicators predicting a sharp increase in unemployment claims within the next year. Therefore, I estimate the probability of this occurring as moderate. 2. **New Jersey Conducting a Referendum on Abortion Rights by August 31, 2024**: As of October 2023, New Jersey has strong protections for abortion rights codified into state law. There have been discussions in some states about enshrining abortion rights into state constitutions in response to changes in federal abortion rights. However, there are no publicly announced plans for New Jersey to hold a referendum specifically focused on abortion rights. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that requires legislative approval and time to implement. Given the lack of current initiatives and the time constraints, the probability of this event occurring is low. 3. **President Biden Delivering a Speech at an NEA Event in California by July 31, 2024**: President Biden has a history of supporting educators and has spoken at National Education Association (NEA) events in the past. Given that 2024 is an election year, it is plausible that he might attend NEA events to connect with educators and voters.

If they continue tightening, the SNB might follow suit to prevent capital outflows and currency appreciation. Conversely, if they pause or cut rates, the SNB may be inclined to maintain or lower its rates. 4. Currency Strength: The Swiss franc is considered a safe-haven currency. An increase in rates could strengthen the franc, potentially hurting exports. The SNB may avoid rate hikes to prevent excessive currency appreciation. 5. Unforeseen Events: Geopolitical tensions, financial crises, or unexpected economic shocks could prompt the SNB to adjust rates differently than currently anticipated. Given the current economic indicators and the SNB's cautious approach, there's a moderate chance that the policy rate will reach or exceed 2.00% by August 2024, but it's not certain."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "5f342f2d-3ec3-43c6-ae42-2fd3e15a869b", "title": "Given the Swiss National Bank's policy rate remains at or above 2.00% in August 2024, will the United States maintain a 100% tariff on Chinese-made machinery through August 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The Swiss National Bank's policy rate is reported to be at or above 2.00% at any point during August 2024, as confirmed by official Swiss National Bank announcements or at least two reputable financial news sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, Swissinfo).

For the purpose of this question, we are to assume that the SNB's policy rate is indeed at or above 2.00% during August 2024.\n\nTurning to the United States' tariffs on Chinese-made machinery, as of October 2023, the U.S. imposes tariffs on a range of Chinese imports, including machinery, primarily at rates of 7.5% to 25% under the Section 301 tariffs initiated during the U.S.-China trade war. There have been no indications or announcements of plans to increase these tariffs to 100%.\n\nImposing a 100% tariff would be a significant escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Such a move would likely have substantial repercussions for global trade and could harm U.S. businesses that rely on Chinese machinery, either for resale or as inputs in their production processes. It could also lead to retaliatory measures from China, further escalating trade tensions.\n\nGiven the current geopolitical climate, while tensions between the U.S. and China persist, both countries have shown some willingness to engage in dialogue to manage their trade relationship. Additionally, with the U.S. presidential elections approaching in November 2024, significant policy shifts like imposing a 100% tariff might be approached cautiously due to potential economic repercussions and political calculations.\n\nTherefore, considering the lack of current plans to impose such a high tariff, the economic self-interest of the U.S., and the potential for diplomatic engagement, it seems unlikely that the U.S. will impose and maintain a 100% tariff on Chinese-made machinery through August 31, 2024."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c799f7f6-cf4a-4b09-9ed1-4d0252c33012", "title": "Given the Swiss National Bank's policy rate remains at or above 2.00% and the US maintains a 100% tariff on Chinese machinery through August 2024, will the Central Bank of Turkey reduce its key interest rate by August 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: By the end of August 2024, both (a) the Swiss National Bank's policy rate remains at or above 2.00% throughout August 2024, and (b) the United States maintains a 100% tariff on Chinese-made machinery through August 2024. \n\nCondition (a) resolves as YES if the Swiss National Bank's policy rate is reported to be at or above 2.00% at any point during August 2024, confirmed by official announcements or at least two reputable financial news sources.

The SNB has been gradually increasing rates to combat inflation, aligning with global trends of tightening monetary policy. Switzerland typically experiences low inflation rates due to its stable economy. For the policy rate to reach or exceed 2.00% and remain there throughout August 2024, inflationary pressures would need to persist or increase. Given the global economic uncertainties and potential inflationary trends, there's a moderate probability that the SNB might raise rates to 2.00% or higher and keep them there into August 2024.\n\n**(b) The United States maintains a 100% tariff on Chinese-made machinery through August 2024**\n\nAs of October 2023, the United States does not have a 100% tariff on Chinese-made machinery. Tariffs imposed during the trade tensions between the U.S. and China have varied, generally ranging from 7.5% to 25% on certain goods. Implementing a 100% tariff would represent a significant escalation in trade barriers and could have substantial economic repercussions. Unless there is a major deterioration in U.S.-China relations leading to drastic policy changes, it's unlikely that a 100% tariff will be imposed and maintained through August 2024. Therefore, the probability of this condition being met is low.\n\n**(c) The Central Bank of Turkey announces a reduction in its key interest rate by August 31, 2024**\n\nIn 2023, the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) has been increasing its key interest rates to address high inflation and restore economic stability under new economic leadership. However, Turkey has a history of cutting interest rates rapidly, sometimes influenced by political pressure to spur economic growth. If inflation begins to decline or if there is a shift in economic policy priorities, the CBRT might reduce rates by August 2024. Given these factors, there's a moderate probability that the CBRT will announce a rate reduction before the specified date.\n\n**Overall Assessment**\n\nFor the question to resolve as YES, all three conditions must be met. While conditions (a) and (c) have moderate probabilities of occurring, condition (b) is unlikely given the current trade policies and economic considerations in the United States. The low probability of the U.S. imposing and maintaining a 100% tariff on Chinese-made machinery significantly reduces the overall likelihood that all conditions will be satisfied by the end of August 2024.\n\nProbability: 0.10"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.034920291232077946, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.008730072808019487, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2705195351104702, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
