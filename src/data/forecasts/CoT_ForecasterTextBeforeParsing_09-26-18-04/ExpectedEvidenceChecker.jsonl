Youngkin has been mentioned as a potential candidate, but he has not officially declared his candidacy. His chances depend on his ability to gain support from Republican voters, which can be influenced by his political record, campaign strategy, and the dynamics of the primary race.\n\n2. **Larry Elder's Status**: The premise states that Larry Elder is not selected as the nominee. This opens up the field for other candidates, including Youngkin. However, it also means that other candidates who are currently in the race or may enter the race could also be strong contenders for the nomination.\n\n3. **Youngkin's Popularity and Appeal**: Youngkin has some appeal as a candidate due to his governorship in Virginia and his ability to attract moderate Republicans and independents. However, his viability as a nominee would depend on how he positions himself against other candidates, including those who may have more national recognition or established support.\n\n4. **Timing and Events Leading Up to the Nomination**: The Republican National Convention will take place in mid-2024, and many events, debates, and primaries will occur before then. These will significantly influence the nomination process. If Youngkin can perform well in early primaries and debates, his chances of being nominated could increase.\n\nConsidering these factors, while it is possible for Glenn Youngkin to become the nominee if Larry Elder is not selected, it is also likely that other candidates will emerge as strong contenders.

Firstly, the political climate leading up to July 20, 2024, is crucial. As of now, Biden's approval ratings and the general sentiment within the Democratic Party towards his presidency will play significant roles. Historically, party unity tends to be strong, especially as elections approach. Senators are often cautious about publicly calling for a sitting president to step down, as it can be seen as a betrayal or a sign of weakness within the party. While there may be some dissenting voices, gathering 10 Senators to publicly advocate for such a move is quite a significant threshold, especially given the potential repercussions for their own political careers. Moreover, the timing of this question suggests that it is close to the 2024 election cycle, where party cohesion is typically prioritized over individual dissent. The Democratic Party is likely to focus on presenting a united front against Republican challengers. Considering these factors, while it is possible that some Senators might express concerns about Biden's viability as a candidate, the likelihood of reaching 10 Senators willing to publicly call for him to drop out seems low. Therefore, I estimate the probability of this question resolving YES to be relatively small."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "4399ea17-aa04-400c-b15f-371d2f3a76b3", "title": "If 10 or more Democratic Senators call for Biden to drop out before July 20, will at least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early?", "body": "Resolution criteria for P: If at any point before midnight July 20 Central Time, the source shows 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out, P resolves to YES.

However, the possibility of at least 20 House or Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing an early nomination hinges on the political climate leading up to the resolution date. If the dissent is minimal in the Senate, it may not translate to a larger movement within the House, where members may feel pressured to maintain party unity. Furthermore, the threshold of 20 lawmakers is significant, but not insurmountable, especially if there are factions within the party that are willing to express their concerns publicly. Given the current political landscape, it is reasonable to estimate that while there may be some dissent, the number of lawmakers willing to publicly oppose the nomination may not reach 20.
