However, Ron DeSantis's nomination is contingent on various factors, including his campaign performance, the political landscape, and other candidates' entries. Additionally, the Republican National Convention will ultimately decide the nominee, which may involve multiple candidates vying for the position. Given that there are several potential contenders, including Donald Trump and others, the probability of DeSantis being the nominee is uncertain. Furthermore, France's placement in the Olympics may not have a direct impact on the Republican nomination but could influence public sentiment and the political climate. Considering these factors, while DeSantis has a chance, it is not guaranteed that he will be the nominee, especially with the possibility of other strong candidates emerging."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "1ad48876-e71a-4a32-9341-956b5073f197", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President, (b) France place in the Top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and (c) Ron DeSantis be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(a) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nThis part resolves as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement that he will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle. The statement must be unambiguous and conclusive, leaving no room for the possibility that Biden would accept the nomination in the 2024 election cycle.\n\n(b) Will France place in the Top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics?\n\nThis part resolves positively if France places in the top 5 (ties resolve positively) at the Olympics being held in 2024. The medal table is calculated by taking the total number of medals won by each participating country and ordering by number of Gold, Silver, and then Bronze Medals. It will resolve ambiguously if the Olympics do not take place in 2024.\n\n(c) Will Ron DeSantis be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?\n\nThis part resolves as Yes if Ron DeSantis is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. All other candidates will resolve as No. This question is not restricted to candidates currently listed; other options may be added in the future.\n\nFor this question, it is not relevant who receives the Republican nomination on the day of the 2024 US election.

(a) Regarding Joe Biden, as of now, he has not indicated any intention to not seek re-election and continues to have significant support within the Democratic Party. However, the political landscape can change rapidly, and announcements can be made unexpectedly. Still, as of now, I would assign a moderate probability that he will not announce his withdrawal before the deadline. (b) The 2024 Paris Olympics are likely to occur, and France, as the host nation, typically performs well in such events. Historically, host countries often have a home advantage, and France has a strong athletic program. Therefore, it seems likely that they would place in the Top 5. (c) Ron DeSantis has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party and has declared his candidacy for the 2024 election. However, the Republican primary landscape is competitive, and while he is a strong candidate, it is uncertain whether he will secure the nomination against other potential candidates. Given the uncertainty surrounding Biden's announcement and DeSantis's nomination, the probability of all three events occurring is reduced. Therefore, I would estimate the overall probability of the question resolving YES as moderate, but leaning towards the lower end due to the uncertainties involved."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5458536144713348, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
