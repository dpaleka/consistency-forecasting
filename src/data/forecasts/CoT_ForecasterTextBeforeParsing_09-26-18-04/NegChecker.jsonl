The ISA operates within a specific political context, and his performance during his tenure, including his relationships with member states and his handling of key issues, will likely influence the election outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the dynamics of the ISA's governing body, which consists of member states, will play a crucial role.

These include technical readiness, any potential delays in pre-launch checks, and the overall mission status as communicated by NASA and Boeing.\n\nAs of now, we are in early July 2024, and while there is time for preparations, the spacecraft's operational history has shown both successes and challenges. If there are no significant issues or delays reported in the coming weeks, it is reasonable to expect that the Starliner will depart as planned. However, unexpected technical problems or mission changes could arise, which might lead to a delay.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there is a possibility of delays, the probability that the Starliner does not depart by the deadline is relatively low, assuming that all systems are functioning well and no major issues arise.
