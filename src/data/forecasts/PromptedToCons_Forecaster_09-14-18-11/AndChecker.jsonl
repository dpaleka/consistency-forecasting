The political landscape can change rapidly, but family ties often play a significant role in political nominations.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is the complement of P, and its probability should reflect the likelihood that none of the Trump family members will secure the nomination. As such, it should be calculated as 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump family member nomination)**: This is closely related to P, and I would expect it to have a similar probability since it\u2019s essentially asking if the event is possible, which is likely given the current dynamics.\n\n4. **Q (US-China armed conflict leading to 100 deaths)**: The geopolitical tensions between the US and China have been escalating, making this a plausible scenario. However, the actual occurrence of such conflicts and the specific criteria of reporting can vary, leading to a moderate probability.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This is a conjunction of P and Q, which would require both to be true. The probability would depend on the independence of the events, but I would estimate it lower than either P or Q alone due to the requirement for both conditions to be satisfied.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This combines the probabilities of P and Q, so it should logically be higher than either of the individual probabilities, but must also respect the constraints of the conjunction.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Armed conflict with no Trump nominee)**: This scenario requires Q to be true while P is false, which may be plausible given the nature of political nominations and international relations.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given P)**: This is a conditional probability that would depend on the relationship between the two events. If a Trump family member is the nominee, it could influence the likelihood of conflicts, but the exact relationship may require further analysis.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these events are interconnected, particularly between P and not_P, as well as P and Q. The estimates must adhere to the consistency rules provided, ensuring that all probabilities align logically and mathematically.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.35\nP_and_Q: 0.21\nP_or_Q: 0.74\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.74 + 0.21 - 0.35 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.35 - 1, 0) <= 0.21 <= min(0.60, 0.35) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.35) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.35) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.74 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.21 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.35\nP_and_Q: 0.21\nP_or_Q: 0.74\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "26ab9504-06e5-4539-a183-e1baf3a8ac9f", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Europa will be the first place humanity will discover extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045, and (b) we will find life on Mars by 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:\n(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045, and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

I would estimate this probability at around 0.65. \n\nConsequently, the probability of not having a member of the Trump family as the nominee (not_P) would be 1 - 0.65 = 0.35. \n\nFor the para_P question, which asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, the answer is likely to be yes, as long as there is a chance (however small) that they could run. Therefore, I would assign para_P a probability of 0.65 as well, reflecting the same likelihood as P. \n\nRegarding the question about armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050 (Q), I would assign a lower probability of 0.30, considering the historical context and the nature of international relations. \n\nFor the combination of both events occurring (P_and_Q), I would estimate this at 0.20, as it requires both events to happen simultaneously, which is less likely than either event occurring independently. \n\nFor P_or_Q, which asks if either event occurs, I would assign a probability of 0.75, as it is more likely that at least one of these scenarios will happen. \n\nThe Q_and_not_P question, which involves armed conflicts occurring while no Trump family member is the nominee, could also be assigned a lower probability, perhaps around 0.15, since it requires a specific combination of events. \n\nFinally, for Q_given_P, the probability that armed conflicts occur given that a Trump family member is the nominee, I would estimate this at 0.25, reflecting a moderate likelihood that the two events could be related. \n\nIn summary, the estimates are as follows:\n- P: 0.65\n- not_P: 0.35\n- para_P: 0.65\n- Q: 0.30\n- P_and_Q: 0.20\n- P_or_Q: 0.75\n- Q_and_not_P: 0.15\n- Q_given_P: 0.25\n\nThese estimates are interrelated and follow the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.25 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1: and consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

This takes into account Donald Trump's significant influence and popularity within the Republican party, as well as the potential candidacy of other family members.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: The probability for no member of the Trump family being the nominee is therefore 0.35, as it is simply the complement of P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This is expected to be close to P, so I estimate it at 0.65 as well, reflecting the possibility that a Trump family member could still secure the nomination.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts with China)**: I estimate a lower probability of 0.30 for armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050. This reflects the ongoing tensions but also the hope that diplomatic measures will prevent such escalations.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: For both a Trump family member being the nominee and armed conflicts resulting in deaths, I estimate a probability of 0.20. This reflects the lower likelihood of both events happening simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: The probability for either event occurring is higher, so I estimate it at 0.75, considering the higher likelihood of at least one of these scenarios happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Conflicts Occurring with No Trump Nominee)**: I estimate a probability of 0.15 for the scenario where conflicts occur but no Trump family member is the nominee, reflecting the independence of these two events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Conflicts Given Trump Nominee)**: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, I estimate the probability of conflicts leading to deaths at 0.35, reflecting a potential increase in tensions due to political dynamics.\n\nOverall, the independence of the events is somewhat maintained, particularly between the political scenario and international conflicts, although there may be some correlation due to the political climate.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P:

Therefore, P_and_Q could be calculated as P * Q, which would be 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. So, it would be 0.60 + 0.30 - 0.18 = 0.72. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Conflict Occurs and No Trump Nominee)**: This can be calculated as Q * not_P, which would be 0.30 * 0.40 = 0.12. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Conflict Given Trump Nominee)**: This is a conditional probability and could be estimated based on the idea that if a Trump family member is the nominee, the likelihood of conflict might increase slightly. I might estimate this around 0.35. \n\nIn summary, I will ensure that the estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between the probabilities of P, not_P, Q, and their combinations. I will check if my estimates pass the consistency checks before finalizing them.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2, failed_check_3, failed_check_4, failed_check_6 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "7e53b4d3-88a5-4cbb-a133-9c703ee8fd3c", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) US life expectancy at birth for both sexes fall below 75 years before 2040 and (b) there be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:\n(a) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

This is influenced by Trump's continued popularity among a significant segment of the Republican base.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at a certain probability, not_P will naturally follow as 1 - P. The lower the probability of P, the higher the probability of not_P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump nominee)**: This should closely align with P, as both reflect the same underlying question but are framed differently. Thus, I expect this to have a similar probability.\n\n4. **Q (China conflict deaths)**: The geopolitical tensions between the US and China are significant, and while armed conflict is a serious concern, the actual occurrence of events leading to 100 deaths is uncertain. I will estimate this probability based on historical data of conflicts and current military posturing.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability will depend on the interaction between P and Q. If both events are somewhat independent, I will calculate it based on the probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This probability will be influenced by the individual probabilities of P and Q. If they are independent, I will use the formula for the union of two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P)**: This is a conditional probability that will require careful consideration of the independence of the two events. I will assess how likely it is for the conflict to occur without a Trump family member as the nominee.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This is a conditional probability that will be influenced by whether a Trump family member is the nominee. I will consider how the political dynamics may affect the likelihood of conflict.\n\n### Independence Considerations:\n- P and Q may not be entirely independent; the political climate can influence international relations.

This probability reflects factors such as Trump's previous presidency and ongoing influence within the Republican Party.\n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P, representing the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee. Given the moderate probability assigned to P, not_P is estimated as the remaining probability.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This probability is expected to align closely with P, as it essentially asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the context, this should be similar to P's estimate.\n\n**Q (China-US Conflict Casualties)**: The probability that armed conflicts between the US and China will lead to at least 100 deaths by 2050 is influenced by ongoing geopolitical tensions and historical conflicts. I estimate this probability to be moderate, considering the potential for escalation in military confrontations.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: This probability is the joint probability that both a Trump family member will be the nominee and that the conflict will lead to casualties. Since both events are somewhat independent, I estimate this probability by considering the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This probability reflects the likelihood that at least one of the two events occurs. Given the independent nature of P and Q, I will calculate this using the formula for the union of two independent events.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (China Conflict and No Trump Nominee)**: This probability considers the scenario where a conflict occurs, but no Trump family member is the nominee.
