Given Donald Trump's previous presidency and ongoing political influence, I estimate this probability at around 0.60. \n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This would be the complement of P, so it will be approximately 0.40. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Nominee)**: Since this is essentially similar to P, I will assign it the same probability of 0.60. \n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflict Leading to Deaths)**: Given the geopolitical climate and historical tensions, I estimate a lower probability of armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050. I will assign this a probability of 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: Here, I need to consider the joint occurrence of both events. Assuming some correlation between the two events, I might estimate this around 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: Given the probabilities of P and Q, I can estimate this using the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, it would be around 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P)**: This would require that there is an armed conflict leading to deaths while no Trump family member is nominated. I would estimate this at around 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This is a conditional probability, and I would estimate this at around 0.30, assuming that if a Trump family member is nominated, the likelihood of conflict might slightly increase due to heightened political tensions.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these probabilities are interconnected, particularly between P and not_P, and between P and Q. I will ensure that the estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.25\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.70\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\n{failed_check_1, failed_check_2, failed_check_3, failed_check_4, failed_check_6 consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.25\nP_and_Q: 0.12\nP_or_Q: 0.68\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}, "cons_P": {"id": "ded80bf0-6ae1-4bcc-a9f6-581a0b32a8b0", "title": "Will the total yield across all countries' nuclear stockpiles at the end of 2029 exceed 8,000Mt?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nResolution will be based on the most recent estimates published in 2029 by reputable sources such as the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).

I would estimate this at 0.10. \n\nQ_given_P: Given that a Trump family member is nominated, the likelihood of armed conflict causing at least 100 deaths may be slightly higher due to increased political tensions, so I would assign it a probability of 0.35. \n\nIn summary, the relationships between these variables reflect their independence and the interaction of political dynamics and international relations.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

Donald Trump remains a significant figure in the Republican Party, and his family members have also been active in politics. The dynamics of the Republican primaries could favor a Trump family member, especially if Donald Trump decides to endorse one of them. \n\n### not_P: Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\nGiven the high probability assigned to P, the probability of not_P would be 1 - P = 0.35. This reflects the uncertainty surrounding other potential candidates who could emerge in the Republican primaries. \n\n### para_P: Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis is essentially a similar question to P, so I would assign a probability of 0.65 here as well, as it aligns with the likelihood of at least one family member being nominated. \n\n### Q: Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\nI estimate this probability to be around 0.30. While tensions between the US and China are high, actual armed conflict leading to significant casualties is less certain. The geopolitical landscape often leads to diplomatic solutions rather than military confrontations. \n\n### P_and_Q: Will both of the following occur: (1) A member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 (2) Armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\nI would estimate this probability to be 0.20. This reflects the combined probability of both events happening, but considering they are not directly dependent, I expect the joint probability to be lower than either event occurring independently. \n\n### P_or_Q: Will either of the following occur: (a) A member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024? (b) Armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\nThis would be higher than either individual probability, likely around 0.75, as it captures the likelihood of either event occurring independently. \n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will both of the following occur: (1) Armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050, and (2) no member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis probability would be lower, around 0.10, reflecting the combined nature of two events that are somewhat independent but also influenced by the broader political context. \n\n### Q_given_P: Given that a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, will armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\nThis probability could be slightly higher than Q alone, perhaps around 0.35, as a Trump family member's nomination might influence international relations and military actions. \n\n### Independence and Relationships\nThe events P and Q are independent in the sense that the political nomination does not directly cause or prevent armed conflict. However, they may influence each other indirectly through media coverage, public sentiment, and policy decisions. \n\n### Consistency Checks\nI will ensure that the probabilities assigned adhere to the consistency rules provided. This includes checking the relationships between P, not_P, Q, and their combinations (and/or). \n\nIn summary, the estimates are based on current political trends, historical context, and the likelihood of various scenarios unfolding in the near future.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.35 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_and\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "cons_P": {"id": "87a31523-9c46-4cc8-bc67-6e705daef0cc", "title": "Will the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact reach 40% of the Electoral college before 2030?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question resolves positively if at least five reliable media sources report that states representing at least 40% of Electoral College votes have signed the NPVIC before 2030.", "resolution_date": "2029-12-31T00:00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "url": null, "metadata": {"topics": [], "background_info": "The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is a an agreement among states to award all of their electoral votes to the candidate with the highest popular vote, conditional on enough states agreeing that the total electoral vote count would secure a majority in the electoral college.

The questions are interrelated, particularly with respect to the potential nominations of the Trump family and the likelihood of armed conflicts leading to significant casualties.\n\n1. **P (Trump Family Nominee)**: This question revolves around whether a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the presidency in 2024. Given Donald Trump's prominence in the party and the possibility of his family members being involved, I estimate a relatively high probability for this event, say around 0.65. This reflects the current political landscape and Trump's continued influence.\n\n2. **not_P**: Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee is naturally the complement of P. Thus, it would be approximately 0.35. This estimate considers the potential for other candidates to emerge within the Republican Party.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Since P is estimated to be quite high, I would also set para_P around 0.65, indicating that it is indeed possible given the current context.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts with China)**: The question of whether armed conflicts with China will lead to at least 100 deaths is complex. Given the geopolitical tensions, I would estimate this probability at around 0.40, acknowledging the potential for escalation in conflicts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question requires both events to occur. Assuming some level of independence between the Trump family nomination and potential armed conflicts, I would estimate this at 0.25, reflecting a moderate intersection of these probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This question will resolve positively if either event occurs. Using the formula for the union of two events, I would estimate this at around 0.75, combining the probabilities of P and Q while accounting for their intersection.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question focuses on the occurrence of armed conflicts while no Trump family member is the nominee. I would set this probability lower, around 0.15, reflecting the potential for conflicts but also the possibility of a Trump family member being nominated.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability asks whether armed conflicts will lead to 100 deaths given that a Trump family member is the nominee. I would estimate this at around 0.45, as the nomination could influence international relations and the likelihood of conflicts.\n\nOverall, these estimates reflect the current political climate and the complexities of international relations. I will ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

Given Trump's strong base, I might estimate a higher probability for P, perhaps around 0.65. \n\nFor not_P, this is simply the complement of P, which would be 1 - P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\nThe question of whether it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination (para_P) should align closely with P, as it is a more general inquiry. Thus, I would estimate para_P to be around 0.65 as well.\n\nRegarding the question of armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050 (Q), I would consider current geopolitical tensions and historical conflicts. Given the unpredictability of international relations, I might estimate Q at around 0.30.\n\nFor P_and_Q, this would involve both P and Q occurring simultaneously. Given my estimates for P and Q, I would calculate P_and_Q using the minimum of P and Q, likely estimating it to be around 0.20. \n\nP_or_Q would be calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q. If P is 0.65 and Q is 0.30, then P_or_Q would be roughly 0.75. \n\nFor Q_and_not_P, this scenario requires Q to occur while not_P is true. Given my estimates, I would assume this is less probable, perhaps around 0.10.\n\nLastly, for Q_given_P, I would consider the conditional probability of Q occurring if P is true. Since Q is somewhat independent of P, I might estimate this at around 0.25.\n\nOverall, I ensure that all estimates adhere to the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the logical relationships between these probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.25 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "cons_P": {"id": "d64b89d3-57c7-4086-a3d4-dae7766a9187", "title": "Will more than 30% of US adults own a personal augmented reality device by 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if anytime before January 1, 2050, a credible survey of adults in the US suggests that more than 30% of US adults own any type of personal augmented reality device.\nFor the purposes of this question, a personal augmented reality device is defined as one which is portable and intended to accompany a person from place to place, and whose primary use is in augmented reality functions. \"Augmented reality functions\" are defined as producing digital information and images overlaid over the user's view of their real environment, which update in real time as the user moves and interacts with the digital and physical environment.

Given Trump's strong base, I estimate this probability at around 0.65.\n\nnot_P: Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee is likely lower, as Trump's influence remains significant. I estimate this probability at 0.35.\n\npara_P: This is similar to P, as it assesses the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination. Given the same reasoning, I estimate this probability at 0.65 as well.\n\nQ: The probability of armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050 is a complex issue. Considering historical tensions and potential conflicts, I estimate this probability at 0.40.\n\nP_and_Q: The probability that both a Trump family member will be the nominee and that conflicts will lead to 100 deaths requires both events to occur. Given the independent nature of these events, I estimate this at 0.25.\n\nP_or_Q: The probability that either a Trump family member will be the nominee or that conflicts will lead to 100 deaths is a union of probabilities. I estimate this at 0.75, as at least one of the events is likely to occur.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This probability considers armed conflicts leading to deaths while no Trump family member is the nominee. I estimate this at 0.15, as it requires both conditions to hold.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability focuses on armed conflicts leading to deaths given that a Trump family member is the nominee.
