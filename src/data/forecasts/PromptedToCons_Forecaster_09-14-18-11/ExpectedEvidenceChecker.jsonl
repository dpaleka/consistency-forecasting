Here\u2019s a breakdown of my reasoning for each variable:\n\n1. **P**: The probability that a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 is influenced by Donald Trump's popularity within the Republican Party, the potential candidacy of his children, and the political climate leading up to the election. Given the current political dynamics, I estimate this probability at **0.60**.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee. Since I estimated P at 0.60, I calculate not_P as **0.40** (1 - 0.60).\n\n3. **para_P**: This question assesses the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination. This is essentially the same as P, so I also set this at **0.60**.\n\n4. **Q**: The probability of armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths is complex and influenced by geopolitical tensions, military engagements, and historical incidents. Given the current international relations, I estimate this probability at **0.25**.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This represents the probability that both events occur: a Trump family member is the nominee and there are significant armed conflicts. Assuming some independence between these events, I estimate this at **0.15**.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This is the probability that either event occurs. Using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, I calculate this as **0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70**.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This represents the scenario where there are armed conflicts but no Trump family member is the nominee. I estimate this at **0.10**, considering that if conflicts arise, they might occur regardless of the political nomination.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths may increase slightly due to heightened tensions. I estimate this at **0.30**.\n\nOverall, my estimates are derived from a combination of current events, historical context, and potential future developments. I will ensure that these estimates comply with the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.25\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.70\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n{and, cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.25\nP_and_Q: 0.13\nP_or_Q: 0.67\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}, "Q": {"id": "60c5393d-c803-4aa0-85b9-e35a32159669", "title": "Will gravitational waves from the merger of supermassive black holes be detected by November 30, 2027?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as positive if by November 30, 2027, a peer-reviewed publication announces the results of such an event.

However, the political landscape is unpredictable, so I would assign a probability of around 0.60 to this event.  \n\n### not_P: Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?  \nThis is the complementary event to P. Given the estimated probability for P, the probability of not_P would be 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.  \n\n### para_P: Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?  \nThis question essentially reflects the same situation as P but is framed in a way that suggests a possibility rather than a certainty. Since the probability of P is 0.60, it makes sense to assign the same value to para_P, as it is asking if it is possible.  \n\n### Q: Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?  \nGiven the current geopolitical tensions, I would assign a moderate probability of 0.30 to this event. While tensions are high, the actual occurrence of such conflicts leading to significant casualties is uncertain.  \n\n### P_and_Q: Will both of the following occur: (1) A member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 (2) Armed conflicts between the United States and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?  \nThe probability of both events occurring together would depend on the independence of P and Q. Since they are largely independent, I would calculate this as P * Q = 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18.  \n\n### P_or_Q: Will either of the following occur: (a) A member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024? (b) Armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?  \nUsing the formula for the probability of either event occurring, P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.60 + 0.30 - 0.18 = 0.72.  \n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will both of the following occur: (1) Armed conflicts between the United States and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050, and (2) no member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?  \nThis probability would be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.30 * 0.40 = 0.12.  \n\n### Q_given_P: Given that a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, will armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?  \nThis is a conditional probability, and while it may not directly affect the probability of Q, I would estimate it to be similar to Q, so I would assign a probability of around 0.30.  \n\n### Summary of Relationships and Independence:  \n- P and Q are largely independent events, which allows for straightforward multiplication and addition of probabilities.  \n- The complementary relationship between P and not_P is straightforward and follows the rule of P + not_P = 1.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nI will now proceed to assign the probabilities based on this reasoning.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.30 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_Q": {"id": "297c8efb-87e1-4c70-8037-59ebbcdcad58", "title": "Conditional on detecting gravitational waves from the merger of supermassive black holes by November 30, 2027, will we detect a message originating from Luyten's Star before 2046?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for the condition:\nThis question will resolve as positive if by November 30, 2027, a peer-reviewed publication announces the results of such an event.

Given Donald Trump's previous presidency and ongoing influence in the Republican party, I estimate a moderate to high probability that a Trump family member could be nominated. \n\n### not_P: Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis prediction is inversely related to P. If I believe there is a reasonable chance of a Trump family member being nominated, then the probability of none being nominated should be lower. Thus, this probability is estimated to be lower than P.\n\n### para_P: Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis is a broader question that encompasses the possibility of any Trump family member being nominated. Since this is essentially a restatement of P, I expect this probability to be similar or slightly higher, as it reflects the general possibility without the constraints of a specific individual.\n\n### Q: Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\nThis question is influenced by geopolitical tensions, military engagements, and historical precedents. Given the current state of affairs and potential flashpoints, I estimate a moderate probability that such conflicts could occur, leading to significant casualties over the specified timeframe.\n\n### P_and_Q: Will both occur: (1) A member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 and (2) armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\nThis combined event requires both P and Q to be true. Given that these events are likely independent, I will calculate this probability as the product of the individual probabilities, assuming a certain level of independence between the political situation and international conflicts.\n\n### P_or_Q: Will either occur: (a) A member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 or (b) armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\nThis is a union of the two events, leading me to expect a higher probability than either individual event. I will calculate this using the formula for the probability of the union of two events.\n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will both occur: (1) Armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050, and (2) no member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis scenario requires that Q is true while P is false. Given the dependencies and potential correlations between political events and military conflicts, I will estimate this probability with a careful consideration of how these events might influence each other.\n\n### Q_given_P: Given that a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, will armed conflicts between the US and China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\nThis conditional probability reflects how the nomination of a Trump family member may influence the likelihood of military conflicts. I will estimate this based on historical context and the current geopolitical landscape.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that the probabilities I assign adhere to the consistency rules provided, checking for logical coherence between related events and adjusting as necessary to maintain mathematical integrity.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P:

This reflects the current political climate, where Donald Trump remains a significant figure, and there is a possibility that other family members could also be contenders. The complementary probability (not_P) is therefore 0.35, indicating a reasonable chance that no Trump family member will be the nominee.\n\nFor the para_P question, which asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, I would assign a similar probability of 0.65, as the possibility remains contingent on the political landscape and family dynamics.\n\nRegarding the question about armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050 (Q), I estimate a lower probability of 0.40. Given the current geopolitical tensions, particularly with China, there is a risk of conflict, but historical data suggests that large-scale military engagements are less frequent.\n\nFor the combined events (P_and_Q), I would estimate the probability at 0.25. This reflects the likelihood that both events occur simultaneously, which is a more restrictive condition.\n\nThe probability of either event occurring (P_or_Q) would then be higher, around 0.75, as it encompasses a broader scenario where either a Trump family member could be the nominee or significant armed conflict could occur.\n\nThe probability of Q and not P (Q_and_not_P) is estimated at 0.15, indicating that it's plausible for armed conflicts to occur without a Trump family member being the nominee.\n\nFor the conditional probability (Q_given_P), I would estimate this at 0.45, suggesting that if a Trump family member is indeed the nominee, the likelihood of armed conflict leading to 100 deaths increases slightly due to potential political ramifications.\n\nThese estimates should align with the consistency rules provided, ensuring that they appropriately reflect the relationships and dependencies between the variables.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.33\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

Either Metaculus would go public itself or a portion of the Metaculus company would be purchased by a publicly traded company at a price that would place the company's value as at least $300 million.\nI included operation by a publicly traded company as an option here to handle a situation in which a publicly traded company is making substantial commitment to this technology.

Given Donald Trump's high profile and the potential for family members to run, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.60 for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P, and thus, it is estimated at 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This question essentially asks if it's possible for any Trump family member to secure the nomination, which I estimate at 0.60, aligning with P since it\u2019s likely that if P is true, para_P is also true.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts with China)**: Given the historical context and ongoing tensions, I estimate a probability of 0.30 for armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: This combines the probabilities of both events happening. Assuming some correlation between the political climate and international conflicts, I estimate this at 0.18.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This combines the probabilities of either event happening, estimated at 0.75, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these significant events will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Conflicts Occur, No Trump Nominee)**: This is estimated at 0.12, reflecting the likelihood of conflicts occurring without a Trump nominee.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Conflicts Given Trump Nominee)**: This is estimated at 0.25, reflecting the possibility of conflicts occurring if a Trump family member is the nominee.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these probabilities are crucial. For example, the estimates for P and not_P must sum to 1, while P_and_Q should be less than or equal to both P and Q. I will ensure that these estimates comply with the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.75 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.75 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.16\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}, "Q": {"id": "5dbac26f-7339-4667-86b3-adfcdeb066b6", "title": "Will the research group that is responsible for developing the first AGI be part of a non-profit corporation?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if the AI system that resolves the question Date first AGI is publicly known. was developed by a research group from a non-profit organization.\nIf the respective AI system is developed under a collaborative effort between two or more different institutions, the question resolves positively for both.

However, considering the potential for other candidates to emerge, I will assign a probability of approximately 0.65.\n\n### not_P: Probability that no member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee.\nThis is the complementary event to P.

Thus, I will keep this at 0.65.\n\n### Q: Probability that armed conflicts between the US and China will lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050.\nGiven the current geopolitical tensions, it is reasonable to expect that there is a non-negligible chance of such an event occurring. I will assign a probability of 0.40 to this event.\n\n### P_and_Q: Probability that both a Trump family member will be the nominee and that armed conflicts will lead to at least 100 deaths.\nThis is a joint probability, and I will estimate it to be the product of the individual probabilities, assuming some level of independence between the two events. Therefore, I estimate this to be 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n### P_or_Q: Probability that either a Trump family member will be the nominee or that armed conflicts will lead to at least 100 deaths.\nUsing the formula for the union of two probabilities, P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, I estimate this to be 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n### Q_and_not_P: Probability that armed conflicts will lead to at least 100 deaths and no Trump family member will be the nominee.\nThis requires estimating the probability of Q given not_P. I will assume a moderate correlation between these events, leading me to estimate this probability at 0.15.\n\n### Q_given_P: Probability that given a Trump family member is the nominee, armed conflicts will lead to at least 100 deaths.\nThis can be estimated as Q itself, so I will keep it at 0.40.\n\n### Summary of Estimates:\n- P: 0.65\n- not_P: 0.35\n- para_P: 0.65\n- Q: 0.40\n- P_and_Q: 0.26\n- P_or_Q: 0.79\n- Q_and_not_P: 0.15\n- Q_given_P: 0.40\n\n### Consistency Checks:\nI will ensure that these estimates obey the consistency rules provided. For example, the sum of P and not_P should equal 1, and the relationship between P_and_Q, P, and Q should also hold. \n\nIn conclusion, these estimates are based on the current political climate and historical data regarding conflicts. I will now proceed to check the consistency of these estimates.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, or, but, cond, para consistency checks failed!}\n\nTo correct the estimates while ensuring consistency, I will revise the probabilities as follows:\n\n1. **P** and **not_P** must sum to 1. Currently, they do (0.65 + 0.35 = 1).\n2. **P_or_Q** must be calculated correctly with the values of **P**, **Q**, and **P_and_Q**. \n3. For **P_and_Q**, I will adjust it to ensure it is less than or equal to both **P** and **Q** and respects the conditions set by the other variables.\n\nAfter reviewing the estimates:\n- I will adjust **P_and_Q** to 0.26 (keeping it the same for now) but ensure it is less than both **P** and **Q**.\n- I will recalculate **P_or_Q** using the correct formula.\n- I will also ensure **Q_and_not_P** is adjusted accordingly.\n\nHere are the updated estimates:\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_Q": {"id": "64805a27-6bb8-495b-8823-9b6afc3219c5", "title": "Conditional on the research group that is responsible for developing the first AGI being part of a non-profit corporation, will Metaculus, or a licensed derivative, be operated as a public site by a publicly traded company by 2030?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nThis question will resolve positively if the AI system that resolves the question 'Date first AGI is publicly known' was developed by a research group from a non-profit organization.

However, for many companies, \"going public\" is a major milestone. Going public allows company founders to \"cash out\" and diversify their portfolios. It also can allow a company to obtain much greater funding than it might from private sources.\n\nQuestion: Will Metaculus, or a licensed derivative, be operated as a public site by a publicly traded company by 2030? The obvious case in which this will be true is if the company owning and operating this site, metaculus.com is a publicly traded company. Either Metaculus would go public itself or a portion of the Metaculus company would be purchased by a publicly traded company at a price that would place the company's value as at least $300 million. I included operation by a publicly traded company as an option here to handle a situation in which a publicly traded company is making substantial commitment to this technology. That should at least involve license payments to Metaculus of at least $300 million in some year that at least half of which come from publicly traded companies.\n", "resolution_date": "2100-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": null, "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.62, "elicitation_metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-14T19:18:12.982712", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('66da35aa-2b68-424f-9e18-b0add78683b3'), title='Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('f479a6ca-6b12-4421-be05-bae55da1c920'), title='Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('5e643677-2440-4f99-b47b-00b8415f61a6'), title='Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if any of the following individuals becomes the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d9e86e5c-9c91-4b5a-8a93-b91b64f84775'), title=\"Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\", body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occur:\\nThere are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\\nThere are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\\nThese 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year; it is sufficient for multiple separate events to reach a total of 100 deaths in this period.\\nThis question will resolves as No otherwise.\\nIn the context of this question, an armed conflict will be defined as a dispute that concerns a government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in an exchange of weapon fire or detonations\\n\", resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2049, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_and_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('eabe942b-3e82-4548-bfdf-a67864ca7ffd'), title=\"Will both of the following occur: (1) A member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 (2) Armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\", body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following are true:\\n1.

This is based on the current political landscape, where Donald Trump remains a prominent figure within the Republican Party. \n\n2. **not_P**: Consequently, the probability of no Trump family member being the nominee would be 1 - P, leading to an estimate of 0.35. This reflects the understanding that while there are other candidates, the Trump family has significant influence. \n\n3. **para_P**: The probability of it being possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination will align with P, hence also estimated at 0.65. \n\n4. **Q (US-China Conflict Deaths)**: For the likelihood of armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050, I estimate a lower probability of about 0.40. This is due to the current geopolitical tensions but also considering the historical context where such escalations can be avoided through diplomacy. \n\n5. **P_and_Q**: The joint probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and the US-China conflict leading to 100 deaths is estimated at 0.26. This reflects the assumption that these events are somewhat independent, but there is a slight correlation due to the political climate influencing foreign policy. \n\n6. **P_or_Q**: The probability of either event occurring is estimated to be 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79, indicating a high likelihood of at least one of these scenarios happening. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: The probability of the US-China conflict leading to 100 deaths while no Trump family member is the nominee is estimated at 0.14. This reflects the understanding that if the Trump family is not involved, the political climate may shift, potentially reducing conflict likelihood. \n\n8. **Q_given_P**: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of the US-China conflict leading to at least 100 deaths is estimated at 0.45, indicating that the political dynamics may lead to increased tensions.\n\nIn terms of consistency, I will ensure that the estimates adhere to the rules provided, such as the relationships between P and not_P, and the calculations for P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and others.

Given the significant media attention surrounding the Trump family, I would assign a relatively high probability to P. \n\nFor not_P, which states that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee, I would assign a lower probability, reflecting the possibility that at least one Trump family member will run. The two probabilities (P and not_P) should sum to 1, maintaining consistency. \n\nThe para_P question, which asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, would mirror the probability of P, as it is essentially asking about the same event but in a more open-ended manner. \n\nThe question Q regarding armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050 is influenced by geopolitical tensions and historical data on conflicts. I would assign a moderate probability to this event based on current trends and expert analyses. \n\nFor the combined events P_and_Q, I would consider the independent probabilities of P and Q. Since both events need to happen for P_and_Q to be true, I would expect this probability to be lower than either P or Q alone. Conversely, P_or_Q would be higher, as it captures the likelihood of either event occurring. \n\nThe Q_and_not_P question involves an intersection of Q with the negation of P. This would likely have a lower probability since it requires Q to occur while simultaneously excluding the possibility of a Trump family member being the nominee. \n\nLastly, Q_given_P examines the scenario where a Trump family member is the nominee and assesses the likelihood of Q occurring under that condition.

This reflects the likelihood that one of the Trump family members will secure the nomination, taking into account the current political landscape and Trump's ongoing influence.\n\n**not_P (Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This is the complement of P, and thus, I estimate it to be 0.35 (1 - P). \n\n**para_P (Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and since it is asking about the possibility rather than certainty, I would estimate it slightly higher at 0.70. This reflects the broader context of political dynamics where anything is possible.\n\n**Q (Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?)**: Given the global political climate and historical tensions, I estimate this probability to be 0.40. This reflects the possibility of armed conflicts escalating to the point of significant casualties.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both occur: a Trump family member is the Republican nominee and armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?)**: The intersection of these two events is less likely than either occurring independently. I estimate this at 0.25, reflecting a lower likelihood that both conditions will be met simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either occur: a Trump family member is the nominee or armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths?)**: This probability should be higher than either event occurring alone. I estimate it at 0.75, as the likelihood of at least one of these significant events happening is quite plausible.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will both: armed conflicts lead to 100 deaths and no Trump family member is the nominee?)**: This scenario is also less likely, as it combines the occurrence of Q with the negation of P. I estimate this at 0.15, considering that if armed conflicts arise, they may coincide with political events involving the Trump family.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, will armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths?)**: This conditional probability may be higher given the political context. I estimate it at 0.45, reflecting the potential for heightened tensions in such a scenario.\n\nOverall, these estimates are designed to be consistent with one another, adhering to the rules of probability. I will ensure that the relationships between these events are logically coherent, particularly focusing on the interactions between P and Q, as they are central to many of the other questions.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n{neg, andor, or, but consistency checks passed!}\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q": {"id": "a0b183b0-cd7a-4389-b202-9e777dd642c0", "title": "Will humanity maintain a continuous off-Earth presence until 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nSince October 31 2000, the date Soyuz TM-31 lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome carrying the members of Expedition 1, the first long-duration ISS crew, humanity has maintained a permanent off-Earth presence for more than 19 years.\nThis question asks: Will humanity maintain an off-Earth presence continuously until 1 January 2050?\nFor a positive resolution, at least one living and conscious biological human must be physically located at some point beyond 100km altitude above Earth's mean sea level at all times continuously until 1 January 2050.

Given Donald Trump's prominence and influence within the Republican Party, I estimate a relatively high probability for this event. However, considering the competition and political landscape, I may not assign it a certainty.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P to be high, not_P will naturally be lower. The relationship here is direct, and the probabilities must sum to 1.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Nomination)**: This question asks if it's possible for any Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the dynamics of political nominations, I expect this to align closely with P, as it is essentially asking if the event is feasible.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts with China)**: This question concerns the potential for armed conflicts leading to significant casualties. Given the geopolitical tensions, I would assign a moderate probability, reflecting both the potential for conflict and the historical context.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: This question is about both a Trump family member being nominated and armed conflicts resulting in deaths. The probability here would be lower than either P or Q alone, as both events must occur simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one Event Occurs)**: This question asks if either event occurs. The probability would be higher than both P and Q alone since it allows for either outcome to happen.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Conflicts Occur, No Trump Nominee)**: This question evaluates the likelihood of armed conflicts occurring while no Trump family member is nominated. This would depend on the independence of the two events and could be assessed based on the probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Conflicts Given Trump Nominee)**: This conditional question assesses the likelihood of armed conflicts occurring, given that a Trump family member is nominated. This is a more nuanced question that may require an adjustment based on the perceived impact of Trump\u2019s nomination on international relations.\n\nIn terms of consistency, I need to ensure that all these probabilities adhere to the rules provided. For example:\n- The sum of P and not_P must equal 1.\n- P_and_Q must be less than or equal to both P and Q.\n- P_or_Q must be greater than or equal to both P and Q.\n- The relationships between the conditional probabilities must also hold true.\n\nOverall, I will need to carefully evaluate these probabilities to ensure that they reflect the relationships accurately and adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_Q": {"id": "f7c2572e-8aa4-4738-989c-ed672e752347", "title": "Conditional on humanity maintaining a continuous off-Earth presence until 2050, will there be a 4-year interval in which world output doubles before 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for the Condition:\nSince October 31 2000, the date Soyuz TM-31 lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome carrying the members of Expedition 1, the first long-duration ISS crew, humanity has maintained a permanent off-Earth presence for more than 19 years.\nThis question asks: Will humanity maintain an off-Earth presence continuously until 1 January 2050?\nFor a positive resolution, at least one living and conscious biological human must be physically located at some point beyond 100km altitude above Earth's mean sea level at all times continuously until 1 January 2050.

Given these factors, I estimate a relatively high probability for P, around 0.65.\n\n**not_P:** This is the complementary event to P, representing the scenario where no member of the Trump family secures the nomination. This probability would thus be 1 - P, which I estimate to be around 0.35.\n\n**para_P:** This question essentially asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Since I have a relatively high probability for P, I would estimate para_P to also be high, around 0.65.\n\n**Q:** The probability of armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050 is influenced by geopolitical tensions, military engagements, and historical precedents. Given the current climate, I estimate this probability to be moderate, around 0.40.\n\n**P_and_Q:** This event requires both P and Q to occur. Given that both events have a reasonable probability of occurring independently, I estimate this joint probability to be around 0.25.\n\n**P_or_Q:** This event will resolve positively if either P or Q occurs. Since both events have significant probabilities, I would estimate P_or_Q to be around 0.75.\n\n**Q_and_not_P:** This event requires Q to occur while not P occurs. Given my estimates, I would assign a lower probability to this event, around 0.15, as it depends on the occurrence of Q while simultaneously excluding P.\n\n**Q_given_P:** This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q occurring given that P has occurred. Since the occurrence of a Trump family member being nominated could potentially influence US-China relations, I would estimate this to be around 0.45.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided, and will adjust estimates accordingly to maintain logical coherence.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}
