Each of these events has a binary outcome (YES or NO), and they are interrelated through various logical combinations. \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk shows up)**: This event is likely to be influenced by Musk's public persona and interest in Bitcoin, as well as the significance of the event itself. Given his history of attending high-profile tech and cryptocurrency events, I estimate a moderate to high probability of him showing up, let's say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it should be approximately 1 - P = 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This question is similar to P, so it will have a similar probability estimate, likely around 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the Lunar Module and the challenges involved in recovering it. I would estimate a lower probability here, around 0.25, reflecting the complexity of the task.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events happening will be lower than either event happening individually, as they are not guaranteed to happen together. I would estimate this around 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either event happening alone, reflecting the likelihood of at least one of the two events occurring. I would estimate this around 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered, Musk does not show)**: This event is more complex as it combines the uncertainty of both events. I would estimate this around 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (If Musk shows up, will Apollo 10 be recovered)**: This conditional probability would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's presence at the event could potentially raise interest or funding for the recovery efforts. I would estimate this around 0.30.\n\nIn summary, I expect a moderate probability for Musk attending the conference and a lower probability for the recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module. The relationships between these events will be reflected in the consistency checks.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e182acfe-2dea-425f-afca-37a2fe27e1c8", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

These events are independent of each other, meaning the occurrence of one does not affect the likelihood of the other. \n\n### Predictions:\n1. **P (Elon Musk shows up)**: Given Musk's active involvement in the cryptocurrency space and his tendency to participate in significant events, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for him showing up.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P = 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would predict it to be 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: Given the historical significance and the ongoing interest in space exploration, I estimate a lower probability of 0.40 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: Since P and Q are independent, this can be calculated as P * Q = 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This can be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This is a conditional probability. Given that Musk shows up, I might estimate that the likelihood of recovering the Lunar Module remains the same at 0.40, as these events are still independent.\n\n### Consistency Checks:\n- The negation rule will hold as P + not_P = 1.\n- The conjunction and disjunction rules will also hold given the independent nature of the events.\n- The conditional probability will hold as well since the events do not influence each other.\n\nOverall, I believe these estimates are reasonable and consistent with the defined rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.35,\nP_and_Q: 0.23,\nP_or_Q: 0.77,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "36df8d04-52df-436e-8ae9-f5feb2ca6aa2", "title": "Will both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson be selected as the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson are selected by the Republican National Convention as nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, it is not guaranteed, so I estimate it around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P, so it should logically be 1 - P. Thus, not_P is estimated at 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is essentially the same as P, so it will have the same probability estimate of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: Given the historical significance of the Lunar Module and ongoing efforts to locate it, there is a reasonable chance it could be recovered, so I estimate this probability at 0.50.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events occurring can be estimated as the product of their individual probabilities if we assume independence. Thus, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.50 = 0.30.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.50 - 0.30 = 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk does not show up)**: This requires both Q to be true and not_P to be true. Assuming independence, Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will the Lunar Module be recovered?)**: This is a conditional probability. If we assume that Musk's attendance has no effect on the recovery of the Lunar Module, then Q_given_P = Q = 0.50.\n\nAfter estimating these probabilities, I will check them against the consistency rules to ensure they do not violate any mathematical relationships.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.50) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.50 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "24221eed-16b9-4988-9f85-8b4b795711e2", "title": "Will either Donald Trump Jr. or Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Donald Trump Jr. or Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

This estimate considers factors like his public persona, the significance of the event, and historical precedents of his attendance at similar events.\n\n2. **Event not_P (Elon Musk's Absence)**: This is simply the complement of P.

Given the historical context and the current unknowns about its location, I might estimate a lower probability, say 0.25.\n\n5. **Event P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: This event's probability is dependent on both P and Q occurring. Given their potential independence, I would calculate this as the product of their probabilities, which would be 0.65 * 0.25 = 0.1625.\n\n6. **Event P_or_Q (At least one Occurs)**: This event captures the likelihood of either event occurring. Given the probabilities, I would calculate this using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\n7. **Event Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 Recovered but Musk Not Attending)**: This event is the probability of Q occurring while P does not. This can be calculated as Q * not_P, assuming independence.\n\n8. **Event Q_given_P (Recovery Given Musk's Attendance)**: This conditional probability would be assessed based on the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. Given the nature of the events, I might estimate this as a moderate value, reflecting that Musk's presence might have a slight positive influence on the recovery efforts.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these events are crucial for calculating the probabilities accurately.

I would estimate this probability to be lower, around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events happening can be estimated as the product of their individual probabilities, given that they are independent events. Thus, P_and_Q would be around 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This would involve both cases happening, so the formula would be P + Q - P_and_Q, leading to approximately 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk not showing up)**: This would be calculated similarly to P_and_Q, but with the probability of not P, giving us approximately 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10 recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability could be estimated based on the understanding that Musk's presence might increase interest and funding in space recovery efforts, possibly giving this a higher likelihood, perhaps around 0.25.\n\nOverall, the independence of P and Q allows us to use the product and sum rules effectively.

These events are somewhat independent; however, they are related through certain conditional probabilities and logical combinations.\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This event depends on various factors such as Musk's schedule, interest in the event, and other commitments. Given his prior involvement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at a certain probability, not_P will be calculated as 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P, and I would assign it a similar probability since it essentially asks about the same event but in a slightly different phrasing.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is dependent on future technological advancements and interest in space exploration. Given the historical significance of the Lunar Module, I would assign a lower probability compared to P, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding its recovery.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events happening)**: This probability would be calculated considering the independence of the two events. If P and Q are independent, P_and_Q = P * Q. If they are not independent, I would need to adjust this estimate based on the relationship between the two events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This probability should take into account both events occurring independently. It would be calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while P does not)**: This probability would require consideration of how likely it is for the recovery of the Lunar Module to happen while Musk does not show up.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P occurs)**: This conditional probability examines the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered if Musk shows up at the Bitcoin conference. I would estimate this based on how these two events might influence each other.\n\nOverall, I will need to ensure that these estimates respect the consistency rules provided, which govern the relationships between these probabilities. For example, the negation rule must hold, along with the rules for conjunctions and disjunctions. I will need to carefully evaluate each probability to ensure they align with these rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "90c336e2-3098-4afa-8bbe-b08590ffe76b", "title": "Will both Mike Pence and Ted Cruz be the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Mike Pence and Ted Cruz are selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

This is influenced by the significance of the event and his known interest in Bitcoin.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, and is calculated as 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is likely to be aligned with P, as it asks about the same event from a different perspective. \n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10 Lunar Module)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain due to its current unknown location and the challenges involved in space recovery missions. Thus, I estimate a lower probability for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events happening is likely to be low, as the recovery of the Lunar Module does not directly influence Musk's attendance at the conference, but both events are independent.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability is influenced by the individual probabilities of P and Q. Since both probabilities are not extremely low, the likelihood of at least one occurring is higher.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module and Musk not showing up)**: This is a combination of two independent events, and the probability is expected to be low since both events are not highly probable on their own.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability is tricky because Musk's attendance does not affect the recovery of the Lunar Module, but it can be estimated based on the likelihood of Q.\n\n**Independence**: The events P and Q are independent of each other since the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other. This independence is crucial for calculating joint probabilities (like P_and_Q and P_or_Q). \n\n**Consistency Rules**: I will ensure that all probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, such as ensuring that the probabilities of complementary events (P and not_P) sum to 1, and that the calculations for joint and conditional probabilities follow the specified mathematical relationships.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "c03a45a3-8db7-45df-b328-3c3e44992ea7", "title": "Will either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

These events are independent of each other, meaning the outcome of one does not influence the outcome of the other. \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk shows up)**: Given Elon Musk's prominence and previous involvement in the cryptocurrency community, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024. This estimate is influenced by historical attendance at similar events and his public interest in Bitcoin.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, calculated as 1 - P. Since we are estimating P at a certain value, not_P will follow accordingly.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is expected to be similar to P since it essentially asks the same question in a different phrasing. \n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges involved in space recovery. I estimate a lower probability for this event based on the historical context and current efforts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability is determined by the intersection of P and Q. Since P and Q are independent, P_and_Q can be calculated as P * Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This is calculated using the formula for the union of two independent events, which is P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered but Musk does not show)**: This event requires both conditions to be true, which can be calculated in a similar manner to P_and_Q, considering the independence of events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10 recovery given Musk shows)**: This is a conditional probability that requires careful consideration. If Elon Musk shows up, it might not directly affect the recovery of the Lunar Module, but it can be influenced by the public interest generated by his presence at the conference.\n\nOverall, I am ensuring that all calculated probabilities adhere to the consistency rules outlined. Each probability is interrelated, and I will check for consistency to ensure that the estimates hold up mathematically.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.155250889784212, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

If I assess a certain probability for P, the probability for not_P will be 1 minus that value.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I expect it to have the same probability estimate.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module by 2050)**: The recovery of the Lunar Module is a complex event involving space exploration, technology, and international cooperation. Given the historical significance of the module, there may be efforts to locate it, but the uncertainty in space recovery leads me to assign a lower probability.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability would depend on the independence of P and Q. Since they are not directly related, I use the product of their probabilities to estimate this.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is calculated using the formula for the probability of the union of two events, which considers the probabilities of each event and their intersection.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module and Musk not showing up)**: This event considers the intersection of Q and not_P, which may be influenced by their respective probabilities.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of Q occurring if P occurs. Since there may be no direct correlation, I estimate it based on the independent probabilities.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that all probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, maintaining logical coherence among the events while considering their relationships and independence.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.20 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e65f52fe-c418-4eb0-af99-c379bf7661bc", "title": "Will Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

Given the importance of the event, I might assign a probability of around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P, so I would assign a similar probability, perhaps 0.60 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of a historical artifact like the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain. Given the challenges of space recovery, I might assign a lower probability, perhaps around 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability would be the product of P and Q if we assume independence.

Given Musk's previous engagements and influence in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending. \n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P. If I believe there's a 70% chance he will attend, then there is a 30% chance he will not.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is essentially the same as P, so I expect it to have the same probability as P. \n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module Recovery)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is a much more uncertain event due to its unknown location and the challenges of space recovery missions. I would estimate a lower probability for this event, perhaps around 20-30%. \n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to happen. Given that both events are somewhat independent but also can influence each other (e.g., if Musk were to promote the recovery of the Lunar Module), I would estimate this probability to be lower than either P or Q alone, reflecting the combined uncertainty.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event will resolve positively if either P or Q occurs. Since I believe both events have a reasonable chance of happening, I expect this probability to be higher than either P or Q alone.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to happen while P does not. Given the independent nature of these events, I expect this probability to be low but not negligible.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability reflects the chance of Q occurring given that P occurs. Given that Musk's involvement in Bitcoin could potentially increase interest in space exploration, I might estimate this probability to be slightly higher than Q alone.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that all these estimates are consistent with the rules provided, particularly focusing on their relationships and the mathematical constraints between them.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.80 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.70, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.25) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.80 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.17,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.005370930026560694, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013427325066401735, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.10363946430143021, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his previous involvement in cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P, and thus I estimate it to be 0.35, reflecting that it is likely he may not attend but is still plausible.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is similar to P, and I estimate it to be equal to P at 0.65, as the phrasing indicates a direct correlation.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module by 2050)**: This event is more uncertain due to its historical context and technological challenges. I estimate a lower probability of 0.40 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q happening)**: The probability of both events occurring is likely lower than either event alone, so I estimate it at 0.26, reflecting the joint occurrence of these independent events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q happening)**: This would be a higher probability than either event alone. I calculate it using the formula for the union of two events, estimating it to be 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not P)**: This scenario also involves independent events, and I estimate this at 0.15, as it reflects the occurrence of Q while Musk does not attend.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given P)**: This conditional probability is likely higher than Q alone but still less than certainty. I estimate it at 0.50, reflecting the increased likelihood of recovery if Musk attends.\n\nOverall, I ensure that all estimates respect the consistency rules, particularly those regarding complements, intersections, and unions of probabilities. I expect that the relationships between these events will hold true and adjust the probabilities accordingly to maintain consistency.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.35,\nP_and_Q: 0.21,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6ffa2295-36ab-4960-a943-ccb4908cb315", "title": "Will Biden remain President through end of July 2024?", "body": "Resolves YES if Biden remains US President through the end of July 2024 (ET); resolves NO if he resigns, dies, or otherwise ceases to be President before then.\n\nTemporary transfer of power under the 25th amendement (i.e. making his VP the Acting President) does not cause a YES resolution.

Given Musk's interest in cryptocurrencies and previous engagements, I estimate a moderate probability that he will show up.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complementary event to P. If P is estimated at around 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Musk's attendance.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This question is closely related to P and should have a similar probability since they both deal with Musk's attendance. However, it might be slightly higher due to the broader phrasing, so I might estimate it at 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the historical context and the challenges surrounding space exploration. I would estimate a lower probability, say around 0.20, as recovery efforts may not yield results.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The occurrence of both events is likely to be less than either event occurring independently. Hence, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.10.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This is likely to be higher than both individual probabilities since it combines them. I would estimate this around 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This would also be a combination of both events, and since not_P is higher than P, I estimate this to be around 0.15.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability is interesting as it suggests that if Musk shows up, it might increase the likelihood of the recovery due to potential media attention or funding. I would estimate this to be around 0.25.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: The events are somewhat independent; however, the conditional relationship of Q given P suggests that there could be a correlation between Musk's attendance and the recovery efforts. The probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules provided, ensuring that the relationships between these events are logically sound.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.10 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.10 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\nneg, and, or, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "8c40d0cc-09fd-464d-8a65-238c6879a510", "title": "Will Joe Biden die before Saturday and remain President through end of July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves YES if both of the following conditions are met: (a) There is an official announcement of Joe Biden's death before market close at the end of Friday, July 26th, and (b) Joe Biden remains US President through the end of July 2024 (ET).

Given the significance of the event, I might estimate this probability moderately high, but not certain, as there are many variables at play.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, hence it should reflect a lower probability than P. If P is estimated at, say, 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, as it essentially asks about the likelihood of him attending without the binary resolution of the question. Therefore, I would expect this to be similar to P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges involved in recovering it. The probability might be lower compared to P, given the historical context and technical challenges.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability would be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be true simultaneously.

Given Musk's history with Bitcoin and his public persona, I would estimate a moderate probability of him showing up.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P. The probability of him not attending should equal 1 minus the probability of him attending. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so they should have the same probability.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain due to the challenges of locating and retrieving it. The probability would be lower given the unknowns involved in such a recovery effort.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability should be lower than both P and Q, as it is conditional on both events happening simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses both possibilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not attending)**: This combines the probability of Q with the complement of P, which should be a lower estimate than either event happening alone.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability would depend on the relationship between the two events. If Musk's attendance somehow increases the likelihood of the recovery, the probability might be adjusted accordingly. \n\nIn terms of consistency, I will need to ensure that the probabilities adhere to the mathematical relationships defined in the consistency rules.

Historical significance may increase interest and effort in recovery, but the actual probability remains low due to the challenges.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring is likely lower than either occurring individually, as they are independent events. This will need to be calculated based on the individual probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either individual event occurring, as it accounts for the occurrence of at least one of the events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This probability will depend on the independence of the two events. If Q is likely to happen regardless of P, this probability could be higher.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: This conditional probability will depend on how the occurrence of P influences Q.

Given the high estimate for P, I assign a lower probability to not_P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P, and since it asks about the possibility rather than certainty, it may have a slightly higher probability than P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This event is highly uncertain due to the unknown location of the Lunar Module, which affects the probability estimate. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This is dependent on both P and Q, and will logically be lower than either individual probability.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone since it includes the possibility of either happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not attending)**: This combines the two events, and its probability should reflect the likelihood of both conditions being met.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability is influenced by the assumption that if Musk attends, it may correlate with a higher likelihood of Q occurring due to increased interest in space exploration.\n\nOverall, I expect these events to have varying degrees of independence, particularly P and Q, as they pertain to different domains (cryptocurrency vs. space exploration).

These two events are independent of each other, meaning the occurrence of one does not influence the occurrence of the other. However, they are linked in the context of the combined events (P_and_Q, P_or_Q, Q_and_not_P). \n\nFor estimating the probabilities:\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: Considering his prominence in the Bitcoin community, I estimate a high probability that he will attend the conference, say around 0.70.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P, which gives us 0.30.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is similar to P, so I would assign it the same probability, 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: Given the complexities and uncertainties involved in space recovery missions, I would assign a lower probability, such as 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: Since P and Q are independent, the probability of both occurring is P * Q, which would be 0.70 * 0.25 = 0.175.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: The probability of either event occurring can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, which gives us 0.70 + 0.25 - 0.175 = 0.875.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This can be calculated as Q * not_P, yielding 0.25 * 0.30 = 0.075.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10 recovery given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability where we assume P has occurred. Since P does not affect Q, I would consider it the same as Q, so it remains 0.25.\n\nAfter calculating these probabilities, I will check each one against the consistency rules to ensure they align correctly.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.175,\nP_or_Q: 0.875,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.075,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.875 + 0.175 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.175 <= min(0.70, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.25) <= 0.875 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.875 - 0.075 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.175 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.175,\nP_or_Q: 0.875,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.075,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "4f59669b-1642-4172-8fcd-a4325d2c50a8", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Donald Trump be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, or (b) Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if either of the following conditions is met:\n\n(a) On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

Thus, I will assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: Given the historical significance of the Lunar Module and ongoing interest in space exploration, I estimate a lower probability of recovery by 2050 at 0.40.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events occurring is likely lower than either event alone due to their independence. I estimate it to be 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This is calculated using the formula for the union of two independent events. I estimate this at 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This scenario requires that the Lunar Module is recovered while Musk does not attend. I estimate this to be 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: This represents the conditional probability of recovering the Lunar Module if Musk shows up. I estimate this at 0.45, as his presence could potentially influence interest and funding in recovery efforts.\n\nOverall, I have ensured that my estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly regarding the relationships between P and not_P, as well as the conditional probabilities. The events P and Q are independent of each other, allowing me to calculate their joint and conditional probabilities accordingly.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.24,\nP_or_Q: 0.76,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.00537092393520161, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013427309838004026, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.10363946430143021, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
