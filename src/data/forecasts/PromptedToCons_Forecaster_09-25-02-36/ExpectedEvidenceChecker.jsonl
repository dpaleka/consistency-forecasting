I predict a value of around 0.65, reflecting a reasonable chance based on his past behavior.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 1 - P, resulting in 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: Since this is essentially the same question as P, I will assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This is a more uncertain event due to the unknown location of the module. I estimate a lower probability of 0.20, reflecting the challenges involved in recovering a lost spacecraft.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be the product of P and Q since they are independent events. Thus, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This would be the probability that Q occurs while P does not. Since these events are independent, Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability reflects the chance of Q occurring given that P has occurred. Since there is no direct dependency indicated, I will assume it remains the same as Q, so Q_given_P = Q = 0.20.\n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n- The events P and Q are independent of each other, meaning the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.\n- The calculations for combined probabilities (P_and_Q, P_or_Q) and conditional probabilities (Q_given_P) are based on their independence.\n\n### Summary:\nOverall, the estimates reflect a balanced view of the likelihood of each event occurring based on available knowledge and assumptions about independence.

However, there are many variables at play, such as his schedule and other commitments, which could affect this probability.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This would be the complement of P. If I estimate P at around 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. This reflects the uncertainty surrounding his attendance.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This question is closely related to P and should have a similar probability since it essentially asks the same thing but in a different form. Therefore, I would set para_P at 0.60 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: The recovery of the Lunar Module is a more speculative question. Given the challenges of space recovery missions and the unknown location of the module, I would estimate this probability to be lower, around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability would be the product of the probabilities of P and Q, assuming independence. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.20, then P_and_Q would be 0.12.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This would be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.20, then P_or_Q would be 0.68.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's recovery without Musk's attendance)**: This event is more complex as it involves the conjunction of two independent events. I would estimate this probability based on the individual probabilities of Q and not_P. If Q is 0.20 and not_P is 0.40, then Q_and_not_P would be 0.08.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk's attendance)**: This would likely be a conditional probability, reflecting that if Musk shows up, it could increase the likelihood of a successful recovery due to potential funding or interest. I would estimate this at around 0.25.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities assigned comply with the consistency rules, especially regarding complements and conjunctions.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.24\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "8470deec-e1fc-4ecd-8a9e-eb89164ccc95", "title": "Given Larry Elder is the Republican nominee, will Glenn Youngkin also be the nominee?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

These events are independent of each other but can be analyzed in conjunction due to the combined questions that involve both events.\n\n**P (Elon Musk showing up)**: I would estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, given his past involvement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency events. However, since attendance at specific events can be unpredictable, I would assign a probability of around 0.60.\n\n**not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P = 0.40.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is likely to be similar to P, as it essentially asks the same question. Therefore, I would assign it a probability of 0.60.\n\n**Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is highly uncertain given the challenges of locating and retrieving space artifacts. Considering the historical significance and the efforts underway, I would estimate this probability at 0.20.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The likelihood of both events happening would be the product of their individual probabilities, assuming independence. Therefore, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This would be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This would be calculated as Q * not_P, which gives us Q_and_not_P = 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08.\n\n**Q_given_P (Apollo 10 recovery given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability. The presence of Musk might increase the interest and resources allocated to the recovery of the Lunar Module, but it is still highly uncertain.

These events are independent of each other, meaning the outcome of one does not directly influence the outcome of the other. However, they are combined in several compound questions, which will require careful consideration of their individual probabilities and how they relate to each other through logical operations.\n\n### Predictions Reasoning:\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: Given Elon Musk's history with Bitcoin and his high-profile status, I would estimate a moderate probability that he will be present at the event. Factors such as his public interest in Bitcoin and previous attendance at similar events would influence this probability.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, which can be calculated as 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is likely to be similar to P since it is asking about the same event but framed in a different way. Therefore, I expect it to have a similar probability.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is much more uncertain due to the unknown location of the Lunar Module and the complexities involved in space recovery. Thus, I would assign a lower probability.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: For this compound probability, I would need to consider the individual probabilities of P and Q. Given their independence, it can be calculated as P * Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability can be calculated using the formula: P + Q - P_and_Q, which accounts for the overlap between the two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not showing)**: This probability would need to consider the probability of Q occurring while also accounting for the probability of not P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10 recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability would likely be influenced by the fact that if Musk shows up, it might increase the likelihood of the recovery being discussed or prioritized, but I would need to estimate this carefully based on available information.\n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n- P and Q are independent events; the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.\n- However, the compound questions like P_and_Q and Q_or_P require careful calculations to ensure they obey the consistency rules and accurately represent the logical relationships between the events.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOverall, the predictions will need to be carefully calculated to ensure they adhere to the consistency rules, especially in terms of how they relate to each other through logical operations.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.20 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, or consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.60,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0841197911220696, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

These events are independent of each other, meaning the outcome of one does not directly affect the outcome of the other. \n\n**P:** The probability that Elon Musk will show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 is influenced by factors such as his interest in Bitcoin, public appearances, and the significance of the event. Given his historical engagement with the cryptocurrency community, I estimate this probability to be moderately high. \n\n**not_P:** This is the complementary event, where Elon Musk does not show up. The probability of this event should logically be equal to 1 minus the probability of P. \n\n**para_P:** This question is similar to P and should have a similar probability estimate since it essentially asks about Musk's attendance in a different phrasing. \n\n**Q:** The probability of recovering the Apollo 10 Lunar Module by 2050 is likely to be lower due to the uncertainty surrounding space artifacts and the challenges of locating and recovering such objects. \n\n**P_and_Q:** This probability represents the chance that both events occur. It should be lower than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q, given that they are independent events. \n\n**P_or_Q:** This probability captures the likelihood that at least one of the two events occurs. It should be greater than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q. \n\n**Q_and_not_P:** This event considers the recovery of the Lunar Module while Musk does not attend the conference. The probability should reflect the independence of these two events. \n\n**Q_given_P:** This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of recovering the Lunar Module given that Musk is present at the conference.

If P is high, not_P will be low. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, as it asks if there is a possibility Musk will attend. The probability will likely be similar to P, given they are asking about the same event.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This is a more uncertain event, as it depends on ongoing efforts to locate and recover the module, which is in a heliocentric orbit. The probability may be lower due to the challenges involved in space recovery missions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring is generally less than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q since they are not directly dependent on each other. However, if one event influences the other (e.g., if Musk's attendance is tied to a space-related discussion), this could slightly increase the joint probability.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This will be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the possibility of either happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the module while Musk doesn't attend)**: This probability will depend on the independence of the two events. If they are independent, it can be calculated as the product of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk attends)**: This conditional probability will likely be higher than Q alone, assuming Musk's presence could positively influence the recovery efforts through increased public interest or funding.\n\nIn terms of consistency rules, I will ensure that the probabilities assigned adhere to the mathematical relationships defined by the consistency rules. Specifically, I will check that:\n- P and not_P sum to 1,\n- P_and_Q is less than or equal to both P and Q,\n- P_or_Q is bounded by the sum of P and Q,\n- The conditional probabilities are consistent with the definitions provided.\n\nOverall, the events are independent but may have some indirect influence on each other, particularly in the context of public interest and funding for space exploration.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_3, failed_check_6 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "6d00b7ac-b644-459f-b4e7-6eb44c42e86e", "title": "Conditional on Kamala's odds of winning increasing over the next week, will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Kamala Harris's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model.

Given his previous involvement with Bitcoin-related events, I estimate this probability to be moderate, around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P**: The probability that Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 is simply the complement of P. Therefore, I estimate it to be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This is essentially the same as P, so I will assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q**: The recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module by 2050 is a much more uncertain event. Given the challenges of space recovery and the fact that the module is currently in a heliocentric orbit, I estimate this probability to be low, around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This probability represents the likelihood that both events occur. Since both events are independent, I will calculate this as P * Q, which results in approximately 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This probability represents the likelihood that either event occurs. I will calculate this using the formula: P + Q - P_and_Q, which gives me approximately 0.52.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This probability represents the likelihood that the Lunar Module is recovered while Elon Musk does not show up. Since these events are independent, I will calculate this as Q * not_P, resulting in approximately 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability represents the likelihood of recovering the Lunar Module given that Elon Musk shows up. I will assume that this does not significantly change the likelihood of recovering the Lunar Module, so I will assign it a similar probability to Q, around 0.20.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities are interrelated, especially through the use of independence assumptions for P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P. I will ensure that the estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.52,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.52 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.52 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.52 - 0.07 is FALSE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "2376415a-ae5a-4b5a-a0f0-b9c37c58808e", "title": "Given Kamala's odds of winning do not increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model, will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Kamala's odds of winning do not increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model.

Given the prominence of the event, I might assign a moderate to high probability, such as 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not attending)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This question is closely related to P, and since it essentially asks the same thing, I would assign a similar probability, perhaps slightly higher at 0.68, reflecting a more optimistic view of his potential attendance.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This is a more uncertain event, given the historical context and the fact that the Lunar Module is currently in a heliocentric orbit. I might estimate this probability at 0.25 based on the challenges of locating and recovering it.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be lower than both P and Q since it requires both events to happen. A reasonable estimate might be 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone. If P is 0.65 and Q is 0.25, I can calculate it using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, leading to an estimate of 0.65 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered, Musk not attending)**: This also combines two independent events, so I would assign a lower probability, perhaps around 0.08.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability might be slightly higher than Q alone, reflecting that if Musk attends, there might be increased interest in space exploration. I might estimate this at 0.30.\n\nOverall, I need to ensure that all estimates obey the consistency rules, particularly regarding the relationships between these events. For instance, not_P must equal 1 - P, and P_and_Q must be less than or equal to both P and Q. I will carefully check these relationships after estimating the probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.68,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.68 is FALSE\n\nneg, and:  andor, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08276200603000777, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his previous engagements with the cryptocurrency community, I estimate a moderate probability for this event. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complementary event to P. Since I have assigned a probability to P, not_P will naturally be 1 - P. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would assign it the same probability. \n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of this historical artifact is uncertain due to its unknown location and the challenges involved in space recovery missions. I would assign a lower probability to this event compared to P. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability can be calculated using the probabilities of P and Q, but since these events may be independent, I would multiply their probabilities. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This is calculated by the formula for the probability of the union of two events, which combines both probabilities while adjusting for any overlap. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk does not show up)**: This event combines the two previous events and requires careful consideration of their independence. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Apollo 10 given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability assesses whether the recovery of the Lunar Module is more likely if Musk attends the conference. I would consider that the two events could be somewhat independent, but there might be a slight increase in interest or resources available for the recovery if Musk is involved in the Bitcoin community.\n\nOverall, I need to ensure that all estimates respect the consistency rules provided, particularly concerning complementary events, independence, and conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.65 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.65 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.65 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d7734550-101a-41bd-a31f-850db57ae335", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his previous engagements with the cryptocurrency community, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.60. \n\n**not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P and can be calculated as 1 - P. Thus, not_P would be 0.40. \n\n**para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I will assign it the same probability of 0.60. \n\n**Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain due to its location being unknown. Given the historical significance but the challenges in recovery, I estimate a lower probability of 0.30. \n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events happening will be the product of their individual probabilities since they are independent. Therefore, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18. \n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.30 - 0.18 = 0.72. \n\n**Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk does not show up)**: This will also be calculated as Q * not_P, so Q_and_not_P = 0.30 * 0.40 = 0.12. \n\n**Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability. If Musk shows up, it might influence the recovery efforts, but not significantly. I will estimate this at around 0.35. \n\nOverall, I believe the events are related in that both have their own uncertainties, and the recovery of the Lunar Module does not directly depend on Musk's attendance at the conference.

Given his previous involvement in cryptocurrency discussions and events, I would estimate a moderate probability of him attending, around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is expected to be equal to P, as it refers to the same event. Therefore, para_P would also be 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module by 2050)**: Given the uncertainty surrounding the location of the Lunar Module and the technological advancements required for its recovery, I would estimate a lower probability for this event, around 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring can be estimated by multiplying the probabilities of P and Q, assuming they are independent. Thus, P_and_Q would be approximately 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q would be 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's recovery and Musk not attending)**: This event requires both Q to be true and not_P to be true. Assuming independence, it would be Q * not_P = 0.25 * 0.40 = 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Apollo 10 given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability is more complex. If Musk attends, it may influence the likelihood of the Lunar Module's recovery positively, perhaps increasing the probability to 0.30.\n\nIn summary, I will provide estimates based on the reasoning above while ensuring that the probabilities adhere to the consistency rules. Each event's probability is interconnected, and changes in one will affect the others. I will ensure that all rules are followed during the estimation process.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 4.501364506886005e-17, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his prominence in the tech and cryptocurrency communities, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, reflecting a balance between his potential interest and other commitments.\n\n**Event not_P**: Conversely, the prediction for whether he will not attend is directly related to the prediction for P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, as these two outcomes are mutually exclusive.\n\n**Event para_P**: This question is similar to P, as it asks about the possibility of Elon Musk attending the conference. Since it's essentially a rephrasing of the same event, I would assign it the same probability as P.\n\n**Event Q**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is a more complex scenario. Given the historical significance of the module and the ongoing interest in space exploration, I would assign a lower probability to this event. Factors influencing this prediction include the technological challenges of locating and retrieving the module, as well as the historical context of similar missions.\n\n**Event P_and_Q**: This event combines both predictions, and I would expect the probability to be lower than either individual event due to the requirement that both must occur. Hence, I would estimate this probability to reflect the compounded uncertainty.\n\n**Event P_or_Q**: For this event, the probability should be higher than both individual events since it allows for either event to occur. This probability is calculated by considering the likelihood of at least one of the events happening.\n\n**Event Q_and_not_P**: This event considers the recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module while also accounting for Musk not attending the conference. The probability here would be influenced by the independence of the two events, but given their separate contexts, I would assign a probability that reflects both scenarios occurring together.\n\n**Event Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of recovering the Lunar Module given that Musk attends the conference. This relationship may introduce additional context or influence, which could either increase or decrease the estimated probability depending on the perceived connection between the two events.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that my estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the mutual exclusivity and independence of events, as well as ensuring that the relationships between the probabilities align logically.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.73,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "fc491703-75ef-4d9c-ada2-51b023cfc083", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given that he is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency community, I would estimate a moderate to high probability of him showing up, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is around 0.65, then not_P would be approximately 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is closely related to P, so I would estimate it similarly, around 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module being recovered by 2050)**: Given the historical significance and the challenges involved in recovering such an artifact, I would estimate this probability to be lower, perhaps around 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: Since both events are independent, I can calculate this as P * Q. Assuming P is 0.65 and Q is 0.25, P_and_Q would be 0.1625.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. If P is 0.65 and Q is 0.25, then P_or_Q would be 0.65 + 0.25 - 0.1625 = 0.7375.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovered and Musk not showing up)**: This requires both events to happen, and since they are independent, we can calculate this as Q * not_P. If Q is 0.25 and not_P is 0.35, then Q_and_not_P would be 0.0875.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability can be estimated based on the assumption that Musk's presence might have no direct impact on the recovery of the Lunar Module, so it would remain around the original estimate for Q, which is 0.25.\n\nNext, I will ensure that these estimates comply with the consistency rules, adjusting them as necessary.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.1625,\nP_or_Q: 0.7375,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.0875,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.7375 + 0.1625 - 0.25 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.1625 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.7375 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.7375 - 0.0875 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.1625 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.1625,\nP_or_Q: 0.7375,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.0875,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "57572d82-1fb9-4748-9ea3-f353582dd03a", "title": "Given Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, will he be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. \n\nThen, will Donald Trump be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?\n\nResolution criteria:\n- For the condition: Donald Trump must be selected by the delegates of the Republican National Convention as the nominee.\n- For the outcome: Resolves \"Yes\" if, on July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

This leads me to estimate P at around 0.60. Conversely, the probability that he will not attend (not_P) would then be 0.40.\n\nRegarding the question of whether Elon Musk's attendance will impact the recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module (Q), these two events are largely independent. The recovery of the Lunar Module is tied to ongoing efforts in space exploration and historical artifact recovery, which I estimate at 0.25. \n\nThe para_P question is essentially a rephrasing of P, so I will assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\nFor the conjunction of both events occurring (P_and_Q), I will use the formula for independent events: P_and_Q = P * Q. Thus, I estimate P_and_Q at 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15. \n\nFor the disjunction (P_or_Q), I will use the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, which gives me P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70.\n\nIn the case of Q_and_not_P, this will require that Q occurs while P does not. Thus, Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.25 * 0.40 = 0.10.\n\nFor the conditional probability Q_given_P, I will consider that if Musk does show up, it may slightly increase the chances of the Lunar Module being recovered due to potential increased interest and funding, so I will estimate this at 0.30. \n\nOverall, I believe these estimates will satisfy the consistency rules, as they are calculated based on the relationships between the events.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "e819abc5-8527-4fec-855f-ece1889d9edb", "title": "Given Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee, will he be removed or blocked from any primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his past involvement in cryptocurrency and public appearances, I might estimate a moderate probability, say 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P and should have a similar probability, as both events are about Musk's attendance. Hence, I might set para_P also at 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This event is highly uncertain due to the historical context and technological challenges. I would estimate a low probability, perhaps around 0.20, given the complexities involved in locating and recovering space artifacts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability should be lower than either P or Q alone, as both must happen.

Given Musk's significant influence and interest in Bitcoin, I would estimate a relatively high probability for P. \n\nFor not_P, this would naturally be the complement of P, so I would expect it to be lower. \n\nThe para_P question is closely related to P, and since it is essentially asking the same thing but framed differently, I would estimate it to be similar to P. \n\nRegarding Q, the recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module is a more uncertain event, as it involves space exploration and recovery efforts that may or may not succeed. Thus, I would give it a lower probability estimate compared to P. \n\nFor P_and_Q, since both events need to occur, I would expect this probability to be lower than either P or Q alone, reflecting the joint probability of both events happening. \n\nP_or_Q would be higher than both P and Q alone since it allows for either event to occur, so I would expect this to be a higher estimate. \n\nFor Q_and_not_P, this would also be a joint probability, but since it involves the negation of P, I would expect it to be lower than P_and_Q. \n\nLastly, Q_given_P evaluates the probability of Q occurring if P is true. Given that the two events are somewhat independent, I would estimate this to be a moderate value, reflecting some correlation but not a strong dependency. \n\nIn summary, I expect the probabilities to reflect the relationships and dependencies between these events, adhering to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a670ca0f-5164-49a9-9c00-9c8f9c445a4e", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, since there are many factors that could influence this (like scheduling conflicts, personal choice, etc.), I would assign a probability of around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This would be the complementary probability of P. Since P is 0.60, not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This question is essentially the same as P, so it should have the same probability estimate of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: The recovery of the Lunar Module is uncertain, given its location is unknown and the challenges involved in space missions. I would estimate a lower probability for this event, around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events happening could be estimated as the product of their independent probabilities, assuming they are independent events. Thus, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. So, P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while P does not)**: This can be estimated as Q * not_P, assuming independence. Hence, Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring if P occurs)**: This is a conditional probability. Given that P occurs, the probability of Q might increase slightly due to potential increased interest or media attention surrounding Musk's attendance. I would estimate this to be around 0.25.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: The events P and Q are independent in the sense that Musk's attendance at the conference does not directly influence the recovery of the Lunar Module, and vice versa. However, they are related in the context of the overall forecasting, as they both involve significant events happening in the future.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and:  cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.24\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "387973ed-acf9-446d-8207-101d79774995", "title": "Conditional on Asa Hutchinson being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, will Donald Trump Jr. be the nominee?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Both events are independent of each other, meaning the occurrence of one does not directly affect the other. However, they are related through the combined events (P_and_Q) and the disjunction (P_or_Q). \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This is influenced by factors such as Musk's schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the conference. Given his past involvement in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate probability that he will show up.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P. If there is a reasonable chance that he will attend, then there is also a reasonable chance that he will not.\n\n3. **para_P**: This is expected to be similar to P since it essentially asks the same question in a different manner, so the probability should align closely with P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the challenges of locating and recovering a historical artifact from space. The probability here is likely lower compared to P, as the recovery of the Lunar Module involves significant technical and logistical hurdles.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This probability will be the product of P and Q, as both events need to occur simultaneously for this to resolve positively. Given the independence of P and Q, this will be less than either individual probability.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This will be higher than either P or Q alone, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these events occurs.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This will also depend on the probabilities of Q and not_P, reflecting the scenario where the Lunar Module is recovered but Musk does not attend the conference.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability will reflect the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true, which may be influenced by the publicity or interest generated by Musk's presence at the conference.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities assigned adhere to the consistency rules provided, especially considering the relationships between the various events.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.74 + 0.16 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.16 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.74 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.16 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.23\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "c740f3c1-9542-4f8b-9c90-815d3ff3f2cc", "title": "Given Asa Hutchinson is not the Republican nominee, will Donald Trump Jr. be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "Suppose Asa Hutchinson is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

These two events are largely independent of each other, as one pertains to a current event involving a public figure, while the other concerns a historical artifact from a space mission. \n\n### Predictions:\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up):** Given Musk's history with Bitcoin and his public persona, I predict a moderate probability that he will attend the conference. This is influenced by his previous engagements with cryptocurrency events.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up):** This is simply the complement of P and should equal 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance):** This is expected to be similar to P, as it reflects the same event but worded slightly differently. \n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery):** This has a lower probability given the uncertainty surrounding the location of the module and the challenges of space recovery missions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring):** Since P and Q are independent, this probability can be calculated as P * Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring):** This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q, which reflects the probability of at least one of the events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not showing up):** This would also be calculated as Q * not_P, reflecting the independence of the events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up):** This is a conditional probability that may need to be adjusted based on any perceived correlation between the two events, though they are largely independent.\n\n### Consistency Checks:\n- The predictions must obey the consistency rules provided. For instance, the negation of P must equal not_P, and the probabilities of independent events must be calculated correctly. \n- I need to ensure that all derived probabilities (like P_and_Q and P_or_Q) are mathematically consistent with the base probabilities (P and Q). \n- Any adjustments made to one probability will need to be reflected across all related probabilities to maintain consistency.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.20 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.033835184215527565, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
