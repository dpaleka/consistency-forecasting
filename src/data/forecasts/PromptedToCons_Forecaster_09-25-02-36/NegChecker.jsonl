Given his prominence in the space, I would estimate a moderate to high likelihood.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024):** This is the complement of P. The relationship between P and not_P ensures that if P is high, not_P should be low, and vice versa.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024):** This is essentially another way of asking about P, so it should have a similar estimate.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050):** This event's probability is likely low due to the uncertainty surrounding the location and recovery of historical artifacts in space. However, the interest in space exploration may lead to increased efforts, which could slightly raise the probability.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring):** This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both events to occur simultaneously. The independence of these events suggests that the combined probability will be less than the individual probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring):** This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone since it accounts for the occurrence of either event.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not P occurs):** This scenario is interesting as it requires Q to happen while Musk does not attend the event. The independence of these events allows for a moderate estimate.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P occurs):** This conditional probability will depend on the relationship between the two events. If Musk attends, it may have implications for the attention and resources allocated to space recovery efforts, potentially increasing the likelihood of Q.\n\nIn summary, while P and Q are independent events, their interrelationships through combined and conditional probabilities will influence the estimates. The estimates must adhere to the consistency rules, ensuring that the values for not_P, P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and other derived probabilities logically follow from the base probabilities of P and Q.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T02:38:12.630784", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('4f8795e5-de7d-42f0-b33c-d0a8fa7c4818'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7d291e8d-884b-4129-a621-d238e31c9e1c'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('327fb28b-6c9e-4b5d-9d75-70b6b45914d8'), title='Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the most significant Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c417ddd7-1209-4e89-a7a2-194ea8d2f1f1'), title=\"Will Apollo 10's Lunar Module be recovered by 2050?\", body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThe Lunar Module flown on Apollo 10 is the only flown lunar module which didn't end up crashing into the Moon or burning up in Earth's atmosphere.\\nAfter 'dress rehearsal' testing in lunar orbit, during which the Lunar Module came within 8.4 nautical miles of the lunar surface, the ascent engine performed a burn to depletion which sent the craft into interplanetary space and the vehicle is currently in a heliocentric orbit.

Given his previous engagement with the cryptocurrency community, I estimate this probability to be moderate.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This is similar to P but framed differently. I would expect this to align closely with P, possibly slightly higher due to the wording implying a broader consideration of attendance.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This is a historical artifact recovery question. Given its current unknown location and the complexities involved in space recovery, I would estimate this probability to be lower.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events occurring would be lower than either P or Q alone, as they are independent events. I would calculate this using the multiplication of their individual probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This would be the sum of the probabilities of P and Q minus the probability of both happening, ensuring that we avoid double counting.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo recovery and Musk not attending)**: This combines the two independent probabilities, and I would expect it to be lower due to the nature of both events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will Apollo be recovered?)**: This conditional probability would depend on the likelihood of Apollo recovery being influenced by Musk's attendance. I would estimate this to be higher than Q alone, as Musk's presence may draw more attention to the recovery efforts.\n\nOverall, I expect these events to be independent, with P and Q having no direct influence on each other. However, the presence of Musk may indirectly affect public interest and funding for space recovery efforts.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.65 is FALSE\n\nand, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06471682202218476, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03235841101109238, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.36524578353570125, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his past involvement in cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 1 - P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P, so I would expect it to be similar, around 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module)**: This event seems less likely given the historical context and the challenges associated with space exploration and recovery. I might estimate this probability at around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: For both events to happen, we can use the formula for the intersection. Assuming P and Q are independent (which they might not be, but for the sake of estimation, I will consider them independent), we can calculate this as P * Q = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, it would be 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered, but Musk not showing up)**: This is also a conditional probability. Assuming independence, this would be Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10 recovery given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability. If we assume that Musk's presence might increase the likelihood of the recovery being discussed or pursued, I might estimate this probability slightly higher, say around 0.25.\n\nOverall, I would ensure that these estimates satisfy the consistency rules, particularly checking for the relationships between P, not_P, and the conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and:  or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "952c295b-bf5e-4aeb-8cb7-5b6c5ccab7d0", "title": "Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T05:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T02:38:07.856285", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('4f8795e5-de7d-42f0-b33c-d0a8fa7c4818'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7d291e8d-884b-4129-a621-d238e31c9e1c'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('327fb28b-6c9e-4b5d-9d75-70b6b45914d8'), title='Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the most significant Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c417ddd7-1209-4e89-a7a2-194ea8d2f1f1'), title=\"Will Apollo 10's Lunar Module be recovered by 2050?\", body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThe Lunar Module flown on Apollo 10 is the only flown lunar module which didn't end up crashing into the Moon or burning up in Earth's atmosphere.\\nAfter 'dress rehearsal' testing in lunar orbit, during which the Lunar Module came within 8.4 nautical miles of the lunar surface, the ascent engine performed a burn to depletion which sent the craft into interplanetary space and the vehicle is currently in a heliocentric orbit.

Given Musk's history with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I would estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, perhaps around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: Since the probabilities of P and not_P must sum to 1, this would be 1 - P, which would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is essentially a rephrasing of P, so it should have the same probability as P, which would be 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10 Lunar Module)**: Considering the historical significance and the challenges involved in locating and recovering a spacecraft, I would assign a lower probability to this event, perhaps around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This would be the joint probability of both P and Q occurring. Given the independence of these events, I could estimate this as P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This would be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Given the estimates, this would be 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This would be the probability of Q occurring while P does not.

However, factors like scheduling conflicts or personal decisions could impact this.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P and will directly relate to the estimate of P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: Since this is a rephrased version of P, I expect it to have the same probability estimate as P, reflecting the same likelihood of his attendance.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module by 2050)**: The recovery of such a unique historical artifact is inherently uncertain. There may be efforts underway to locate it, but the probability of successful recovery is likely low given the challenges of space recovery.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both Elon Musk attending the conference and the recovery of the Lunar Module will be lower than either event occurring individually, as they are independent events. The estimates for P and Q will guide this calculation.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability will account for the likelihood of at least one of the events happening, which will be greater than either event on its own but less than the sum of both due to potential overlap.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module and Musk not attending)**: This will depend on the estimates for both Q and not_P, and since these are independent, the product of their probabilities will give a reasonable estimate.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk attends)**: This conditional probability will consider how the likelihood of recovering the Lunar Module may change if Musk shows up at the conference, possibly due to increased media attention or funding.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that my estimates reflect the independence of the events and adhere to the consistency rules.

The relationship between these events is important because they affect the predictions for combined events such as P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and others.\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk shows up)**: This event is influenced by factors such as Musk's schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the conference. Given his previous involvement in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, so I would set it equal to P, as it essentially asks the same question in a different form.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovered)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges of recovery. I might estimate this at a lower probability since it involves significant logistical challenges and uncertainty.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: For this combined event, the probability is generally lower than either individual event, as it requires both conditions to be met. I would calculate this using the multiplication rule or a reasonable estimate based on independence.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either individual event, and I would calculate it accordingly.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk does not show up)**: This event requires both conditions but is more complex since it involves the conjunction of an event and its negation.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will the module be recovered?)**: This conditional probability would depend on how I view the relationship between Musk's attendance and the likelihood of the module being recovered. If I see Musk's presence as increasing interest or funding for space recovery efforts, I might estimate this probability higher.\n\nOverall, I need to ensure that all the probabilities I estimate adhere to the consistency rules provided.

Given his involvement in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate to high probability of him attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Since this is the complementary event to P, its probability is simply 1 - P. This means if P is estimated at a certain value, not_P will be the remaining probability.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so they will have the same probability estimate.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This event's probability is likely lower due to the uncertainties surrounding the recovery of a spacecraft lost in interplanetary space. Factors here include technological advancements, funding, and interest in such historical artifacts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability will be influenced by the individual probabilities of P and Q. If both events are somewhat independent, we can multiply their probabilities. If they are dependent (e.g., if Musk's attendance is tied to the recovery efforts), then we need to adjust accordingly.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This is calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. It reflects the likelihood that either Musk attends the conference or the Lunar Module is recovered.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs, but P does not)**: This probability will depend on the individual probabilities of Q and not_P. If Q is likely to happen regardless of P, we can estimate this probability accordingly.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q given that P occurs)**: This conditional probability will reflect how likely the Lunar Module recovery is if Musk attends the conference. If there is a strong correlation between the two events, this probability will be higher.\n\nOverall, I will need to ensure that the estimates for each of these events obey the consistency rules provided. The relationships between these events are crucial for determining the correct probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "65da20ac-c384-4223-a73a-c55009b79efe", "title": "Will Doug Burgum not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Doug Burgum is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

These two events are largely independent of each other, as one is related to a current event (a conference) and the other pertains to a historical artifact located in space. \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: The probability of this event can be influenced by various factors including Musk's schedule, interest in the Bitcoin community, and the significance of the event. Given Musk's history with Bitcoin, I would estimate a moderate probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P to be a certain value, not_P will be 1 minus that value.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P, and I would expect it to have a similar probability estimate since it essentially asks the same question in a different form.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges involved in space recovery operations. I would assign a lower probability to this event compared to P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events happening can be estimated using the product of their individual probabilities, as they are independent events. This will be less than or equal to the lower of the two probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: The probability of at least one of the events occurring can be calculated using the formula for the union of two independent events, which is P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q happening while P does not)**: This is the probability that the Lunar Module is recovered while Musk does not show up. It can be estimated by considering the independence of the two events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P occurs)**: This conditional probability will reflect the likelihood of recovering the Lunar Module if Musk shows up at the conference, which might not be directly related but could be influenced by public interest and funding for space recovery initiatives.\n\nOverall, I expect the probabilities to reflect the nature of these events, with P and para_P being relatively high, Q being lower, and the combinations being calculated based on their independence and relationships.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09431067947124139, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047155339735620694, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44426165831931935, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his prominence in the tech and finance sectors, I would estimate a moderate probability that he will attend.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complementary probability to P. If I estimate P at a certain level, not_P will be the remainder. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is expected to be similar to P since it essentially asks the same question but in a different phrasing. \n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This probability is much more uncertain due to the unknown location of the Lunar Module and the challenges associated with space recovery missions. I would estimate this probability lower than P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This joint probability will be influenced by both individual probabilities. If both events are independent, I can multiply their probabilities, but I need to account for any correlation if they exist.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability will be calculated using the formula for the union of two events, which accounts for the overlap between P and Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Lunar Module recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This scenario combines the probabilities of two independent events occurring together, which will need careful evaluation.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability will depend on whether Musk's presence at the conference might influence the likelihood of the Lunar Module's recovery.\n\nIn assessing these probabilities, I will ensure that they adhere to the consistency rules, particularly those relating to negation, conjunction, and disjunction. I must also consider the independence of events when calculating joint probabilities, as the events surrounding Elon Musk's attendance and the recovery of the Lunar Module may not necessarily be independent.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.20 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "d3664c64-918c-48ec-aee0-55b04e941328", "title": "Will OpenAI's ChatGPT not be generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024?", "body": "The question resolves as **YES** if [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) is not generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, and **NO** otherwise.\n\n\"Generally available\" here means that the default state for people in the EU is that they cannot access it without a VPN (possibly requiring paying for it.)

Given his history with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency events, I estimate a moderate probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P, and thus its probability should be derived from P. If P is estimated at a certain level, not_P should reflect that accordingly.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This should align closely with P since both questions are essentially asking about the same event but from slightly different angles. The probability should be similar to that of P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovered by 2050)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location and the challenges of space recovery. I would assign a lower probability compared to P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events happening would be the product of their individual probabilities, assuming some independence. However, if one event influences the other, that should be taken into account.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: The probability of at least one of the events occurring should be calculated using the formula for the union of two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk not attending)**: This probability would depend on the independence of the two events. If they are dependent, it would need to reflect that relationship.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10's recovery given Musk attends)**: This conditional probability would require an understanding of how Musk's attendance might influence the recovery efforts or vice versa.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities assigned follow the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, and para_P, and how Q interacts with these events. The independence or dependence of these events will guide the calculations for the combined probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.17\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06471682202218454, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03235841101109227, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.36524578353570125, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
