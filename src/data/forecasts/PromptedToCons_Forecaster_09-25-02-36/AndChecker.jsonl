If P is high, not_P will be low. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, as it essentially asks the same question in a different way. The probability should be aligned with P, hence I expect it to be similar. \n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This event is much more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges involved in space recovery. I estimate a lower probability here compared to P. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both P and Q happening is expected to be lower than either P or Q alone, as they are independent events. However, if either event is highly unlikely, this probability will reflect that. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than both individual probabilities, as it accounts for the occurrence of either event. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This asks for the conjunction of two independent events, and its probability should reflect the likelihood of both occurring simultaneously. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability might suggest that if Musk attends, it may increase the interest or resources available for the recovery of the module, potentially raising this probability compared to Q alone. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities respect the consistency rules provided, such as the relationships between P and not_P, and the conjunctions and disjunctions of the events.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e6e128a8-5942-4828-91aa-bd358fc1c8af", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his prominence in the space, I might assign a moderate to high probability here, possibly around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is similar to P and would likely share the same probability, as it refers to the same event but is worded differently. Thus, I would also estimate this at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This question involves a historical artifact and the feasibility of recovering it. Given the challenges of space recovery and the time frame, I might assign a lower probability of around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: This probability would be the product of P and Q, assuming independence. If P is 0.65 and Q is 0.20, then P_and_Q would be 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: For this, I would apply the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. So, if P is 0.65, Q is 0.20, and P_and_Q is 0.13, then P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not_P occurs)**: This would be calculated similarly, considering the independence of the events. If Q is 0.20 and not_P is 0.35, then Q_and_not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P occurs)**: This is a conditional probability. If P occurs, I might adjust Q's probability higher due to potential synergies between the two events. I might estimate this at 0.25, given that Musk's presence could raise interest in space exploration topics.\n\nIn summary, I would ensure that these probabilities align with the consistency rules provided, adjusting any estimates as necessary to maintain mathematical integrity. The relationships between the events, particularly between P and Q, will be essential in determining the correct probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.26\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "89c018df-ebc9-43ed-9da9-711efaaaaeb7", "title": "Will both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson are selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

These events are independent of each other, meaning the occurrence of one does not directly influence the occurrence of the other. \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: The probability estimate for this event can be influenced by various factors such as Elon Musk's schedule, the significance of the event, and his past participation in similar conferences. Given his high profile and the excitement surrounding Bitcoin, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. Therefore, if P is estimated at 0.73, not_P would be 0.27. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This should be closely aligned with P, as it essentially asks the same question. I will estimate it to be equal to P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges involved in recovery. I estimate this probability to be lower than that of P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: Since P and Q are independent, this can be calculated as P * Q. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: For this, I will use the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. This represents the probability that at least one of the events occurs.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while P does not)**: This would be calculated as Q * not_P, reflecting the scenario where the Lunar Module is recovered, but Elon Musk does not show up.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P occurs)**: This is a conditional probability that can be estimated based on the assumption that if Elon Musk shows up, it may have some influence on the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered, though I will keep it independent for this estimate.\n\nIn conclusion, I will set the probabilities based on the reasoning above, ensuring they adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.73,\nnot_P: 0.27,\npara_P: 0.73,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.29,\nP_or_Q: 0.84,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.73 = 1 - 0.27 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.73 = 0.84 + 0.29 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.73 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.29 <= min(0.73, 0.40) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.73, 0.40) <= 0.84 <= min(1, 0.73 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.73 = 0.84 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.73 \u2248 0.29 / 0.40 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.73 = 0.73 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.73,\nnot_P: 0.27,\npara_P: 0.73,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.29,\nP_or_Q: 0.84,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.73", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.019684036520819015, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.006561345506939671, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1964068930964144, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This is influenced by the timing and significance of the event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, reflecting the uncertainty regarding his attendance.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is expected to be high, similar to P, as it reflects the same event from a different angle, indicating the likelihood of him being present.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknowns surrounding the location of the module and the challenges of recovering it. Therefore, I estimate a lower probability for this event compared to P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The joint probability of both events occurring is expected to be lower than either event occurring independently, as there is no direct causal relationship between Musk's attendance and the recovery of the Lunar Module.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability will be higher than the individual probabilities of P and Q but less than 1, as it accounts for the possibility of either event occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of Lunar Module while Musk does not show up)**: This probability is expected to be low, as it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty that Musk is not attending.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Lunar Module given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of the Lunar Module's recovery if Musk is at the conference. While P does not directly affect Q, it may influence perceptions or media coverage, potentially increasing interest in the recovery efforts.\n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n- P and Q are generally independent events; however, their joint probabilities and conditional probabilities may reflect indirect relationships based on shared context (e.g., media attention).\n\n### Consistency Rules:\n- The probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules outlined, such as the complementarity of P and not_P, the relationships between joint and individual probabilities, and the bounds established by the maximum and minimum values for combinations of probabilities. I will ensure that my estimates respect these rules in the final output.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "dbd16036-0107-4e19-bcff-49cdb621344b", "title": "Will Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

Given his previous engagement with Bitcoin and crypto events, I estimate a moderate to high probability that he will attend, perhaps around 0.65. \n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P, so it should be 1 - P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is closely related to P and should have a similar probability since it essentially asks the same thing but with slightly different wording. I would assign it a similar probability estimate of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery)**: This is a much more uncertain event due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges involved in recovering it. I would estimate this probability lower, around 0.20, given the historical context and challenges.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to occur. Given the probabilities of P and Q, I can use the formula for the intersection of independent events: P_and_Q = P * Q. Therefore, P_and_Q would be 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event resolves positively if either P or Q occurs. Using the formula for the union of independent events: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to be true while P is false. The probability of this occurring can be calculated as Q * not_P.

Given his previous involvement with cryptocurrency and public appearances, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not attending)**: This would be the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module by 2050)**: The recovery of this historical artifact is uncertain due to the challenges involved in space exploration and recovery. Given the current state of technology and interest in space, I would estimate this probability at 0.40.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This would be the product of the probabilities of P and Q if they were independent. Therefore, I would estimate this as P * Q = 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one of the events occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module and Musk not attending)**: This would be dependent on the probabilities of Q and not_P. Assuming independence, this would be Q * not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk attends)**: This is a conditional probability. I would estimate this to be slightly higher than Q alone, say around 0.45, because Musk's presence might increase interest and funding for such recovery efforts.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities are reasonably estimated based on the relationships and independence of the events.

Given his prominence in the Bitcoin community, I would estimate a moderate to high probability of attendance, perhaps around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Since this question is effectively asking the same thing as P, I would assign a similar probability of around 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module is uncertain due to its current location being unknown. Given the historical significance and ongoing efforts to locate it, I would estimate a lower probability, perhaps around 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability would be the product of the individual probabilities if we assume independence. Thus, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.65 * 0.25 = 0.1625.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This would be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.25 - 0.1625 = 0.7375.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This would be calculated as Q * not_P, which gives us Q_and_not_P = 0.25 * 0.35 = 0.0875.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur)**: This is a conditional probability and would likely be higher than the unconditional Q due to the context of Musk's involvement potentially increasing interest and funding for space recovery efforts. I would estimate this around 0.35.\n\nOverall, I expect that P and Q are somewhat independent events but may have slight correlations due to the nature of public interest in both cryptocurrency and space exploration.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.74 + 0.16 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.16 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.74 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.16 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and:  andor, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "97a47d62-3fc5-4b3a-aa69-4cd843ae9163", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The not_P question has a complementary probability, which I will derive from the P estimate. \n\nThe para_P question is essentially a rephrasing of P, so its probability should align closely with P's estimate. \n\nFor the question regarding the recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module (Q), I consider the historical context and the ongoing efforts to locate it. However, given the uncertainty surrounding such an endeavor, I assign a lower probability to this event. \n\nThe P_and_Q question combines both events, so its probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, reflecting the joint occurrence of both events. The P_or_Q question should capture the likelihood of at least one of the two events occurring, which should be higher than either event alone. \n\nThe Q_and_not_P question combines the recovery of the Lunar Module with Elon Musk not attending the conference, which should have a unique probability estimate based on the independence of the two events. Lastly, the Q_given_P question evaluates the likelihood of recovering the Lunar Module given that Elon Musk shows up, which may suggest a slightly higher probability due to the potential media attention from his presence. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that my estimates respect the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the relationships between P and not_P, as well as the interactions between P and Q.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "0cbe69a6-904f-49bb-8fad-353960bbfdcd", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, and (b) Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) As of July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

These events are largely independent but can influence each other in the context of the combined questions.\n\n### Predictions:\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: Given his history with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency events, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, say around 0.60. This reflects his past engagements and the significance of the event.\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This would simply be 1 - P, which would be 0.40.\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: Since this is essentially the same as P, I will set this at 0.60 as well.\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This is a more uncertain event given the unknowns about the module's location and the efforts required to recover it. I estimate this at a lower probability, perhaps 0.25.\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events happening can be calculated using the independence assumption: P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15.\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is calculated as P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70.\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q happening while P does not)**: This is calculated as Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.25 * 0.40 = 0.10.\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given P happens)**: This is essentially asking for the conditional probability. Given that P occurs, the likelihood of Q might increase slightly due to potential collaborative efforts or media attention, so I would estimate this at around 0.30.\n\n### Relationship and Independence:\nThe events P and Q are independent in the sense that the occurrence of one does not directly affect the other. However, they are related in the context of the combined questions (P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P). The calculations must respect the consistency rules outlined, ensuring that the probabilities align correctly across the various combinations. \n\nOverall, the estimates should be carefully calibrated to ensure adherence to the consistency rules, particularly those involving conjunctions and disjunctions of events.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given the popularity of the event, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.60 that he will attend.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it should be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, and since it essentially asks the same question in a different phrasing, I can assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain due to its location being unknown. Historical context suggests a lower probability, so I estimate this at 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The likelihood of both events happening is lower than either happening independently.

Factors influencing this could include his previous involvement in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, as well as the current relevance of such events in his agenda. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the direct negation of P, and its probability should logically be related to P. If P has a high probability, not_P should have a low probability, and vice versa.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is essentially a rephrasing of P and should have a similar probability to P since it\u2019s asking about the same event but framed in a different way.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10 Lunar Module)**: This is an independent event from P and is based on historical and technological factors regarding space exploration. The probability will depend on the ongoing efforts and feasibility of recovering such artifacts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: For this probability, we need to consider the likelihood of both P and Q happening simultaneously. If both events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to get this estimate.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be calculated by considering the individual probabilities of P and Q, accounting for their intersection (P_and_Q).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered, but Musk does not show)**: This is a scenario where Q happens, but P does not. It will be dependent on the probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Apollo 10 given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability will depend on the relationship between the two events. If Musk's attendance somehow affects the likelihood of the lunar module's recovery, that needs to be reflected in the estimate.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are crucial for ensuring the probabilities adhere to the consistency rules.

I would estimate a moderate probability for this, say around 0.65, based on previous appearances and general interest in Bitcoin.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P, so it should equal 1 - P. If I set P at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This should align closely with P, so I can set this equal to P, giving it a probability of 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The probability of recovering a historical artifact like the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain, given the challenges of space exploration and recovery. I would estimate this at a lower probability, perhaps around 0.40, due to the unknowns involved.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This event's probability would be the multiplication of the probabilities of P and Q, assuming independence. So if P = 0.65 and Q = 0.40, then P_and_Q = 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Using the values above, this would be 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovered and Musk not showing up)**: This event would depend on the probabilities of Q and not_P. If Q = 0.40 and not_P = 0.35, then Q_and_not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will Apollo 10's Lunar Module be recovered)**: This is a conditional probability that would likely be influenced by the context of Musk's involvement in technology and space. I might set this at a slightly higher probability, say 0.50, given the positive influence of Musk's presence.\n\nOverall, I need to ensure that all these probabilities are consistent with each other, following the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.52\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0026706895643983097, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0008902298547994366, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given Musk's previous engagement with cryptocurrency, I would estimate a moderate probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P as moderately likely, not_P will be correspondingly less likely. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P and should have a similar probability estimate since it asks about the potential of his attendance.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This question is quite speculative, as it involves a historical artifact and the efforts to locate it. Depending on the advancements in technology and interest in space exploration, I would estimate a lower probability for this event due to the uncertainty surrounding the recovery.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events happening is likely to be lower than either event happening independently, as they are not directly related but are contingent on two different factors. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: The probability of either event occurring should be higher than the individual probabilities of P and Q, as it encompasses both possibilities. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This scenario combines the probability of Q with the negation of P, which again should yield a lower probability than either event happening alone.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will Apollo 10 be recovered?)**: This conditional probability might be higher than Q alone, as it assumes that Musk's presence could potentially have a positive impact on the recovery efforts of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that all the probability estimates respect the consistency rules provided, especially focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, Q, and their combinations. I will carefully consider the dependencies and independence of these events to provide a coherent set of estimates that satisfy the mathematical rules.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.65 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.65 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.65 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d012f2a8-12c5-46a2-b0d9-59d9da61dff8", "title": "Will Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his history of participating in such events, I estimate a moderate to high probability for him to show up, let's say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complementary event to P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This question is closely related to P and would likely have a similar probability estimate, as it essentially asks the same thing but in a different phrasing. I would set this at 0.60 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is a complex task that depends on various factors including technological advancements and funding. Given the uncertainty surrounding this event, I estimate a lower probability, perhaps around 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The occurrence of both events is dependent on both P and Q happening simultaneously. To estimate this, I would use the product of their probabilities, assuming some level of independence: P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Substituting the values gives us: P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module while Musk does not show up)**: This is a more complex relationship, but assuming some level of independence, I would estimate this at Q * not_P = 0.25 * 0.40 = 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability could be higher than Q alone if Musk's presence somehow influences the recovery efforts. I might estimate this at around 0.30.\n\nOverall, these events are interrelated, with the attendance of Musk being a more social and public event while the recovery of the Lunar Module is a technical and historical endeavor. The estimates reflect a balance between optimism about Musk's engagement with Bitcoin and skepticism about the feasibility of recovering a lost spacecraft. The probabilities must respect the consistency rules laid out, meaning that the relationships between these events must be mathematically sound.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "ca736674-0fdb-4600-b0f8-164a30d797a2", "title": "Will Donald Trump be removed or blocked from any U.S. state's primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, and will Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

However, both questions are framed in a binary manner, allowing for straightforward probabilistic reasoning.\n\nFor the event P (Elon Musk showing up), I would consider factors such as his past engagement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency events, his public persona, and the overall significance of the event. If I estimate a probability of 0.60 for P, it suggests a moderate belief that he will attend.\n\nFor not_P, which is the complement of P, I would estimate it at 0.40, ensuring that the total probability sums to 1. \n\nThe para_P question is essentially a rephrasing of P, so I would assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\nFor the event Q (recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module), I would consider the challenges associated with locating and recovering such an artifact. Given the uncertainties and the historical context, I might estimate this probability at 0.25, indicating a belief that recovery is possible but quite uncertain.\n\nThe joint event P_and_Q would be the intersection of both events occurring. Assuming some level of independence, I could estimate this at P (0.60) * Q (0.25) = 0.15.\n\nFor the event P_or_Q, I would apply the formula for the union of two independent events: P + Q - P_and_Q. This would yield 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70.\n\nThe event Q_and_not_P would capture the situation where the Lunar Module is recovered, but Musk does not show up. This would be Q (0.25) * not_P (0.40) = 0.10.\n\nFinally, for Q_given_P, I would consider the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered given that Musk shows up. This may not significantly change the probability, but I could estimate it at a slightly higher value, perhaps 0.30, reflecting that his presence might bring more attention to space exploration topics.\n\nOverall, I would ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules outlined, particularly focusing on the relationships between the probabilities and ensuring they align with the mathematical constraints.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
