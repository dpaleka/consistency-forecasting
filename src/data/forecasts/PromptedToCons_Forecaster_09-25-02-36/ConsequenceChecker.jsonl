This reflects both his interest in Bitcoin and the significance of the event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Since this is the complement of P, it is calculated as 1 - P, leading to an estimate of 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is expected to be aligned with P, thus I also set this to 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of a historical artifact like Apollo 10's Lunar Module is uncertain, given its unknown location. I estimate a lower probability of 0.40, reflecting the challenges involved in locating and recovering it.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: Since both events are independent, I calculate this as P * Q, resulting in 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q, resulting in 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not attending)**: This is calculated as Q * not_P, leading to 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk's attendance)**: This is assumed to be independent as well, so I estimate it to be approximately equal to Q, which is 0.40.\n\nOverall, the estimates reflect the relationships and independence of these events, and I will ensure that they adhere to the consistency rules provided. I will check each rule to confirm that the estimates align correctly.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_3 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This reflects both his interest in Bitcoin and the likelihood of him being invited.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This would be the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, adhering to the negation rule.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P and should align with it, so I will set this to 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This is a more uncertain event due to the unknown location of the Lunar Module. Given the historical significance and the potential for technological advancements, I might estimate this at 0.30.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events happening)**: This will require a lower probability since it depends on both events occurring. If I assume some independence, I can multiply the probabilities: P_and_Q = 0.65 * 0.30 = 0.195.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event happening)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.30 - 0.195 = 0.755.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This would depend on the probabilities of both events. Assuming independence, I can calculate Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.30 * 0.35 = 0.105.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Lunar Module recovery given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability. The presence of Musk might have no direct effect on the recovery of the Lunar Module, so I could estimate this to be close to Q, perhaps around 0.30.\n\nOverall, these estimates will need to be checked against the consistency rules to ensure they align properly.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.195,\nP_or_Q: 0.755,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.755 + 0.195 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.195 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.755 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.755 - 0.105 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.195 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.195,\nP_or_Q: 0.755,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "1e7fce5c-6d93-4eb1-9de7-d65aa54b4bbb", "title": "Will OpenAI publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by December 31, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by December 31, 2024, OpenAI publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T02:52:50.933770", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('4f8795e5-de7d-42f0-b33c-d0a8fa7c4818'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7d291e8d-884b-4129-a621-d238e31c9e1c'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('327fb28b-6c9e-4b5d-9d75-70b6b45914d8'), title='Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the most significant Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c417ddd7-1209-4e89-a7a2-194ea8d2f1f1'), title=\"Will Apollo 10's Lunar Module be recovered by 2050?\", body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThe Lunar Module flown on Apollo 10 is the only flown lunar module which didn't end up crashing into the Moon or burning up in Earth's atmosphere.\\nAfter 'dress rehearsal' testing in lunar orbit, during which the Lunar Module came within 8.4 nautical miles of the lunar surface, the ascent engine performed a burn to depletion which sent the craft into interplanetary space and the vehicle is currently in a heliocentric orbit.

I estimate P_and_Q at 0.14, calculated as P * Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability can be estimated as the sum of the individual probabilities minus the intersection (P_and_Q), leading to an estimate of P_or_Q at 0.56.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk not showing up)**: This is also a combined event, which I estimate at 0.06, relying on the lower probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability.

Given these factors, I might assign a probability of around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P = 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: Since this is essentially the same question as P, I would also assign it a probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This event is more uncertain given the historical context and the challenges involved in space recovery efforts. Therefore, I might assign a lower probability, say 0.40.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This is the joint probability of both P and Q happening. If we assume independence for simplicity, it would be calculated as P * Q = 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This would be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, it would be 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P)**: This is a bit tricky since it involves the condition that Musk does not show up. If we assume independence, we could calculate this as Q * not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given that P occurs)**: This is a conditional probability and would likely be influenced by the fact that if Musk shows up, it might increase the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered (due to increased interest or funding).

Therefore, I estimate P at 0.65.\n\nFor the complementary question (not_P), since it is simply the opposite of P, I estimate not_P at 0.35. \n\nThe para_P question, which inquires about the possibility of Elon Musk attending, is closely related to P. Given that the two questions are effectively asking about the same event, I will set para_P to the same probability as P, which is 0.65.\n\nFor the question regarding the recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module (Q), this is a more uncertain event due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges associated with space recovery missions. I estimate Q at 0.20.\n\nThe joint occurrence of both events (P_and_Q) would be less likely than either event occurring independently. Therefore, I estimate P_and_Q at 0.13, reflecting the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nFor the event where either P or Q occurs (P_or_Q), this should be higher than either individual probability, so I calculate it using the formula for the union of two probabilities: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q.

Given that this is a significant event in the Bitcoin community, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending, say around 0.60.\n\nThe complementary question (not_P) would then have a corresponding probability of 0.40, reflecting the uncertainty of his attendance.\n\nFor the question about the possibility of Elon Musk attending (para_P), I would assign a similar probability to P, as it essentially asks the same thing with slightly different wording. Thus, I estimate para_P to also be around 0.60.\n\nThe question regarding the recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module (Q) is more uncertain due to the historical context and the challenges associated with such a recovery. Factors influencing this probability include the technological capabilities and interest in space exploration by 2050. Given these uncertainties, I might estimate Q at around 0.25.\n\nThe joint question (P_and_Q) requires both events to occur. If I assume P is 0.60 and Q is 0.25, I can estimate P_and_Q using the formula for independent events, resulting in a probability of 0.15.\n\nFor the disjunction (P_or_Q), I would calculate it using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q, leading to around 0.70. This reflects the likelihood of either event occurring.\n\nThe question about both events occurring with not_P (Q_and_not_P) would also have a lower probability, as it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty that Musk does not show up, possibly leading to a probability of around 0.10.\n\nLastly, the conditional question (Q_given_P) would likely have a higher probability since if Musk attends, it might increase the probability of interest and efforts in recovering the Lunar Module, leading to an estimate of around 0.30.\n\nOverall, I expect the estimates to reflect the relationships and dependencies between these events, ensuring that they adhere to the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0026707053388299058, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013353526694149529, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his interest in cryptocurrency, I would estimate a moderately high probability for this event. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P since it asks about the possibility of him being a guest at the event. Therefore, I would assign the same probability as P. \n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: Given the historical significance of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module and the ongoing interest in space exploration, I would assign a moderate probability to this event as well, but lower than P due to the uncertainties involved in space recovery missions. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring would be lower than either individual event due to the independence of the two questions. I would estimate this probability based on a multiplication of the individual probabilities, adjusted for any correlation. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This would be higher than the individual probabilities but must remain below 1. It reflects the likelihood that at least one of the two events occurs. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not attending)**: This requires both conditions to be true. I would estimate this as a lower probability since it combines the uncertainty of both events. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will the Apollo 10 Module be recovered?)**: This is a conditional probability. If Musk shows up, it could potentially have a positive influence on the public interest and funding for space recovery missions, which might slightly increase the probability of Q. \n\nOverall, I expect that these events are somewhat independent, but the presence of Musk at the Bitcoin conference might indirectly influence the public's interest in space recovery, thus affecting the probabilities of Q and Q_given_P.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.35,\nP_and_Q: 0.23,\nP_or_Q: 0.77,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "d6360125-11fe-40c8-bb09-90552664aee1", "title": "Will the US government end its agreement directly allowing Verisign to manage the authoritative domain name registry for the .com TLD, before August 3, 2025?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if before August 3, 2025, the US Department of Commerce (DOC) officially terminates or sunsets its Cooperative Agreement with Verisign recognizing Verisign's management of the *.com* generic top-level domain (TLD).

Given his past involvement with cryptocurrency and public appearances, I estimate a moderate probability.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P, and therefore, its probability should be directly related to P.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P and should reflect a similar probability, possibly slightly higher given that it encompasses a broader range of possibilities.\n\n4. **Q (Will Apollo 10's Lunar Module be recovered by 2050?)**: This event is quite uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges in recovering it. I estimate a lower probability here.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both Elon Musk show up and the Apollo 10 Lunar Module be recovered?)**: This probability will be lower than both P and Q since it requires both events to occur simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either Elon Musk show up or the Apollo 10 Lunar Module be recovered?)**: This probability should be higher than both individual probabilities since it allows for either event to satisfy the condition.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will the Apollo 10 Lunar Module be recovered and Elon Musk not show up?)**: This event combines Q with the negation of P, which could have a moderate probability depending on the independence of the events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up, will the Apollo 10 Lunar Module be recovered?)**: This conditional probability will likely be influenced by the likelihood of P, but it may not be directly proportional due to the separate nature of the events.\n\nOverall, I need to ensure that my estimates for these probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly regarding the relationships between complementary events, conjunctions, and disjunctions.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.18\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.18 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.65 is FALSE\n\nfailed_check_3, failed_check_6, failed_check_7 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.16\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0026707053388299058, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013353526694149529, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
