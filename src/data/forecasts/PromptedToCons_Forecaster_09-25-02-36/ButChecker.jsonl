Given his involvement in the cryptocurrency space, I would assign a moderate probability to this event, estimating it to be around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is similar to P and should have the same probability, so I would also set this at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of such an artifact is uncertain due to the challenges of locating and retrieving it. Given the historical significance and the ongoing efforts, I would assign a probability of 0.30 to this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability would be the product of the individual probabilities of P and Q if we assume they are independent events. Therefore, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.65 * 0.30 = 0.195.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Here, it would be 0.65 + 0.30 - 0.195 = 0.755.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This would require both events to happen independently. Assuming independence, it would be Q * not_P = 0.30 * 0.35 = 0.105.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability. If Musk shows up, it may influence the probability of the Module's recovery positively, so I would estimate this to be higher than Q, perhaps around 0.40.\n\nIn summary, the events are interrelated, with P and Q being independent in terms of their occurrence, but the conditional probabilities suggest that one event may influence the likelihood of the other. I will now proceed to output the probability estimates based on this reasoning.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.195,\nP_or_Q: 0.755,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.755 + 0.195 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.195 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.755 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.755 - 0.105 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.195 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.195,\nP_or_Q: 0.755,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "72a6fdfd-7af9-4af1-86ba-f705c9126260", "title": "Will Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee and Mike Pence not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following occur: (a) Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (b) Mike Pence is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Both events are binary, meaning they can only resolve as 'Yes' or 'No.' \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: I estimate a probability of 0.65. This is based on Elon Musk's previous engagements and interest in Bitcoin. However, the uncertainty surrounding his attendance at specific events, especially given his busy schedule, keeps the probability below 0.7.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply 1 - P, so I estimate it at 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: Since this is essentially a rephrasing of P, I assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: Given the historical significance and the ongoing efforts to locate the module, I estimate a probability of 0.40 for its recovery by 2050. This is a lower estimate due to the challenges involved in space recovery missions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring is likely lower than either event happening independently. I estimate it at 0.26, reflecting the combined uncertainty.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than the individual probabilities of P and Q, so I estimate it at 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not attending)**: This scenario combines the probability of Q with the probability of not P, which I estimate at 0.14, reflecting the independence of the two events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10 recovery given Musk shows up)**: Given that Musk's attendance doesn't directly influence the recovery of the Lunar Module, I estimate this at 0.38.\n\nIn terms of independence, P and Q are not directly related; Musk's attendance does not affect the recovery of the Lunar Module. However, since both events are considered in the context of the same timeframe, they might have some indirect influence on public interest and funding for such recoveries. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.38 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "995008e8-3a23-4f5b-9b26-47149fca7c05", "title": "Will either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Both events are binary in nature and can be analyzed independently, but their combination in various questions introduces interdependencies that must be considered.\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This event is contingent on various factors, including Musk's schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the event. Given Musk's history of involvement in cryptocurrency, I estimate a relatively high probability of him showing up, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P**: Since this is the complement of P, it will be 1 - P, which would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P, so I will assign it the same probability of 0.65, as it essentially addresses the same event.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This is a much more uncertain event due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges involved in recovery. I would assign a lower probability, perhaps around 0.20, considering the historical significance and technical challenges.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This probability should be lower than both P and Q, as it represents the intersection of two independent events. I would estimate it at 0.13, reflecting the lower likelihood of both happening together.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it includes the probability of either event happening. I would estimate it at about 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This would represent the scenario where Apollo 10's Lunar Module is recovered, but Elon Musk does not show up. Given the independent nature of these events, I would estimate this at around 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This is a conditional probability that assumes P has happened. I would estimate this to be higher than Q alone, perhaps around 0.25, as the presence of Musk may influence the efforts or interest in recovering the Lunar Module.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that these estimates are consistent with the rules provided. I will check for complementarity, independence, and other relationships to ensure all estimates align with the defined rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.3055652680704688, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.10185508935682293, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7862200179375403, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Therefore, I estimate this at 0.65 + 0.30 - 0.195 = 0.755.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This combines the probability of Q with the complement of P. I estimate this at Q * not_P = 0.30 * 0.35 = 0.105.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will the module be recovered)**: This is a conditional probability, and I would estimate it based on the likelihood of the module being recovered if Musk attends.

Given Musk's previous engagements, I estimate a reasonable probability that he will attend, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it will be 1 - P, which would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, so I can estimate it similarly. I might set this at 0.65 as well, as it reflects the same likelihood.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the Lunar Module. Given historical context and the challenges of space recovery, I might estimate this at a lower probability, say around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The likelihood of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities, assuming independence. So, this would be P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Hence, it would be 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of Lunar Module and Musk not showing up)**: This event combines Q and not_P, and can be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability would depend on how the presence of Musk might influence efforts to recover the Lunar Module. If I estimate that his presence increases the chances of recovery slightly, I might set this at 0.25.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these events suggest that while P and Q are somewhat independent, they can still influence each other, particularly in the context of public interest and media coverage.

I would estimate a moderate probability of around 0.60, considering his known engagement with the crypto community.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complementary event to P, and its probability would be 1 - P. If P is estimated at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This question is closely related to P, and I might estimate it similarly, around 0.60, as it essentially rephrases the likelihood of P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain due to its location and the challenges of space recovery. I would estimate a lower probability of around 0.25 based on historical context and current efforts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as both events must happen. I might estimate it at 0.15, considering the independence of the two events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: This would be calculated using the probabilities of P and Q and their intersection (P_and_Q). If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.25, I would estimate this at around 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not P)**: This would require Q to happen while Musk does not appear. If Q is 0.25 and not_P is 0.40, I might estimate this at 0.10, considering the independence.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given P)**: This conditional probability would depend on how likely Q is if P happens. I might estimate this at around 0.30, as Musk's appearance might increase interest in space recovery efforts.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between P and Q is that they are independent events, but they can affect the overall probabilities of combined events.

Given his previous engagements and influence in the cryptocurrency space, I might estimate a moderate to high probability that he will attend, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P, and should logically be around 0.35, as it directly relates to the probability of P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P and should have a similar probability estimate, perhaps slightly higher if we consider it as a more general question about the possibility of his attendance, say around 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This event is more uncertain due to the historical and technical challenges involved in recovering a spacecraft from interplanetary space. I might estimate a lower probability for this, around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This is a conjunction of the two events. Since both events are independent, I would estimate this as the product of their probabilities, approximately 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This would be the sum of the individual probabilities minus the conjunction, so it would be around 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of Lunar Module and Musk does not show up)**: This would also be independent, and I would estimate it as Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability would likely be similar to Q, as Musk's attendance may not significantly influence the recovery of the Lunar Module, so I might keep it around 0.20.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between P and Q is that they are independent events, which allows for straightforward calculations of conjunctions and disjunctions.

Conversely, the probability of him not attending (not_P) should be complementary to P, reflecting the binary nature of the question. For the question regarding the possibility of his attendance (para_P), I expect it to be similar to P, as both questions are closely related. \n\nThe question about the recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module (Q) is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges involved in space recovery missions, leading to a lower probability estimate. \n\nThe joint occurrence of both events (P_and_Q) is likely to be lower than either individual event, reflecting the compound uncertainty. \n\nFor the disjunction (P_or_Q), I expect a higher probability, as it encompasses both events, and at least one of them is likely to occur. The conjunction of Q with the negation of P (Q_and_not_P) will depend on the independent probabilities of Q and not_P. \n\nThe conditional probability (Q_given_P) reflects the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true, which could be higher if Musk's attendance at the conference increases the likelihood of the Lunar Module's recovery being prioritized or discussed at the event. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that the estimates respect the consistency rules, particularly those relating to the relationships between P, not_P, and Q.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and:  cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "804d8e7e-9303-4c7e-8935-1fb285091fc1", "title": "Will either Nikki Haley or Glenn Youngkin be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Nikki Haley or Glenn Youngkin is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his previous involvement with cryptocurrencies, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending, around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, as it asks if there is a possibility of him attending. Therefore, I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain due to its unknown location and the challenges involved in such a recovery. I would estimate a lower probability of 0.30 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The likelihood of both events happening is the product of their independent probabilities, so I would estimate this to be around 0.195 (0.65 * 0.30).\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. Given the probabilities, I would estimate this to be around 0.725.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered while Musk does not show up)**: This is a more specific scenario that combines Q with not_P. Given the probabilities, I would estimate this to be 0.105 (0.30 * 0.35).\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability would likely be higher than the general probability of Q since Musk's presence might influence the recovery efforts positively. I would estimate this at around 0.40.\n\n**Independence**: The events P and Q are not directly related; Musk's attendance at the conference does not affect the recovery of the Lunar Module. However, they are still evaluated together in the context of P_and_Q and P_or_Q. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that all probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, adjusting any values as necessary to maintain mathematical integrity.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.195,\nP_or_Q: 0.725,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.725 + 0.195 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.195 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.725 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.725 - 0.105 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.195 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.195,\nP_or_Q: 0.725,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.23611124799852745, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.07870374933284248, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7191949522280762, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

I could estimate this at 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Will Apollo 10's Lunar Module be recovered by 2050?)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is a complex event that depends on various factors, including technological advancements and funding for space exploration. Given the uncertainties, I would estimate this probability at around 0.40.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both occur: Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and the Lunar Module is recovered by 2050?)**: This event requires both P and Q to be true. Assuming independence, I would calculate this as P * Q = 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or the Lunar Module be recovered by 2050?)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Using the estimates, this would be 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both occur: the Lunar Module is recovered by 2050 and Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This requires Q to be true while P is false. This can be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up, will the Lunar Module be recovered by 2050?)**: This is a conditional probability, which could be estimated based on the assumption that if Elon Musk attends the conference, there may be more interest in space exploration. I might estimate this at 0.50.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities provided adhere to the consistency rules, especially concerning complements, conditional probabilities, and joint probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\nneg, and:  andor, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "c77e82d3-7884-486f-b3a5-50a7fb777bb4", "title": "Will Larry Elder be the Republican nominee and Glenn Youngkin not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (2) Glenn Youngkin is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The questions are interconnected, particularly through the logical relationships defined by the consistency rules. \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk shows up)**: This is a binary event and is likely influenced by Musk's current interests in cryptocurrency and his past involvement in the Bitcoin community. I would estimate a moderate probability for this event based on these factors.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P. If P is estimated at a certain probability, not_P should be calculated as 1 - P. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This is essentially a rephrasing of P and should have the same probability as P, as it addresses the same event from a different angle.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This event is more uncertain given the historical context and the challenges associated with recovering a lost spacecraft. The probability here may be lower than that of P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This event requires both P and Q to be true, so its probability must be calculated based on the probabilities of P and Q. The relationship is governed by the 'and' rule in the consistency rules.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This event is true if either P or Q occurs, and its probability will be influenced by both individual probabilities and their intersection (P_and_Q).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 is recovered, but Musk does not show up)**: This event requires Q to be true while P is false. The relationship here is also governed by the 'and' rule.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (If Musk shows up, will Apollo 10 be recovered?)**: This conditional probability will depend on the relationship between the two events. If Musk's attendance somehow increases the chances of recovery, this probability might be higher than Q alone.\n\nOverall, the estimates need to be carefully balanced to ensure they adhere to the consistency rules, particularly regarding complements and logical combinations.

If I estimate a high probability for P, I must correspondingly lower the probability for not_P. \n\n2. **para_P** is a paraphrase of P and should have the same probability as P. Therefore, if I assign a probability to P, I will assign the same to para_P. \n\n3. **Q** (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovered by 2050) is independent of P. Thus, I can assign a probability to Q without directly affecting P. However, since both questions are binary, the probabilities must be consistent when combined in conjunction with other questions. \n\n4. **P_and_Q** (both P and Q occur) relies on the probabilities of both P and Q. The probability of this event should be less than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q. Therefore, I need to ensure that my estimate for P_and_Q respects this relationship. \n\n5. **P_or_Q** (either P or Q occurs) must be calculated based on the individual probabilities of P and Q, ensuring that it does not exceed the sum of their probabilities. \n\n6. **Q_and_not_P** (Q occurs and P does not) requires careful consideration of the relationship between Q and not_P, ensuring that I respect the independence of Q while reflecting the probability of not_P. \n\n7. **Q_given_P** (Q given P) implies that the occurrence of P may influence the probability of Q. However, in this case, since they are relatively independent, I will estimate this based on the relationship defined by the probabilities of P and Q.\n\nIn summary, I will assign initial probabilities while ensuring that all consistency rules are followed and that the relationships between the events are respected.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.21438933667199078, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.07146311222399693, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7722242389548244, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

These events are independent of one another, meaning the occurrence of one does not directly affect the likelihood of the other. \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This event's probability will be influenced by factors such as his schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and potential commitments. Given his previous involvement in the crypto space, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.60 for this event. \n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 1 - P, leading to a probability of 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is essentially a rephrasing of P, so it should have the same probability estimate of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is highly uncertain due to the challenges of space recovery and the unknown location of the module. I estimate a low probability of 0.20 for this event based on historical context and current efforts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: The probability that both events occur can be estimated by multiplying their independent probabilities, leading to P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: The probability that at least one of the events occurs can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, which gives us 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event captures the scenario where the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is recovered, but Elon Musk does not show up. This can be estimated as Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood that the Lunar Module will be recovered if Elon Musk shows up. Given the independence of these events, I might estimate Q_given_P to be similar to Q, so I would estimate it at 0.20.\n\nOverall, the relationships and independence of these events allow for straightforward calculations of probabilities while adhering to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "72f0af1a-6ae6-4fa0-bc98-8e5fa3773353", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election and Donald Trump Jr. not be the nominee?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (2) Donald Trump Jr. is not selected as the nominee.

Factors influencing this include his schedule, public interest, and potential benefits of his appearance. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This is likely to be similar to P, as it essentially asks the same question but in a slightly different phrasing. I estimate this to be around 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is a more uncertain event. Given the historical significance and the challenges of locating and recovering space artifacts, I estimate a lower probability for this event, around 0.30.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The joint occurrence of both events is likely to be lower than either event occurring individually, as they are independent. I estimate this to be around 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This should be higher than either individual probability but less than the sum of both, due to the intersection of both events. I estimate this to be around 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk does not show up)**: This scenario combines the recovery of the Lunar Module with Musk's absence, which is plausible. I estimate this at around 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will the Lunar Module be recovered)**: The occurrence of Musk showing up may influence the perception of the Lunar Module recovery, but it does not directly affect the probability. I estimate this to be around 0.25.\n\nIn summary, the events are somewhat independent, with P and Q not directly affecting each other's outcomes. The estimates provided will need to be checked against the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "902dc2e5-f08e-4edf-8f7c-8b8c238e43b4", "title": "Will either Donald Trump Jr. or Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Donald Trump Jr. or Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The relationship between these events is important for calculating the probabilities of combined events such as P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and Q_and_not_P.\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk shows up)**: Given Musk's high-profile nature and previous involvement in Bitcoin, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend the conference, likely around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, calculated as 1 - P, which would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is expected to be similar to P, as both questions are closely related. I would estimate this to be around 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknowns surrounding the recovery efforts. I would estimate a lower probability of about 0.40.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events occurring would be the product of the two probabilities if we assume independence: P * Q = 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This would be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This would require Q to occur while Musk does not attend. This probability would be estimated as Q * not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: This is a conditional probability. If Musk does attend, it may affect the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered, but not significantly. I would estimate this to be around 0.45.\n\nOverall, these estimates will be checked against the consistency rules to ensure that they adhere to the mathematical relationships defined in the rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.35,\nP_and_Q: 0.23,\nP_or_Q: 0.77,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.2361112480028329, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.07870374933427764, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7191949522280762, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
