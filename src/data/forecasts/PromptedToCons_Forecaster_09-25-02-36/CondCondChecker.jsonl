For instance, the sum of probabilities for P and not_P must equal 1, and the probabilities for P_and_Q and P_or_Q must be calculated based on the individual probabilities of P and Q.

Given his prominence in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate to high probability that he will attend, considering the significance of the event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This event is the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.70, then not_P should be around 0.30. However, I will adjust both probabilities to ensure they sum to 1.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility that Elon Musk will attend Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is closely related to P, so I expect it to have a similar probability. \n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain due to its unknown location and the challenges of space recovery missions. I estimate a lower probability for this event, as it relies on future technological and exploratory advancements.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability will be lower than P and Q individually, as both events need to happen simultaneously. The correlation between these events is low, but not zero, since both involve significant public interest and potential funding.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the occurrence of at least one of the two events. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not_P occurs)**: This is an intersection of Q and not_P, which I expect to be low, as the recovery of the lunar module does not depend on Musk's attendance at the conference.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: If Musk attends the conference, it might increase public interest in space exploration, potentially influencing the recovery efforts of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module.

Given Musk's history with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P, so it should be 1 - P. Thus, not_P would be approximately 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is similar to P, as it assesses the likelihood of his attendance. Since it is essentially the same inquiry, I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module being recovered by 2050)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is a more uncertain event, considering its current unknown location and the challenges involved in space recovery missions. I would assign a lower probability estimate of around 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The occurrence of both events is dependent on the individual probabilities of P and Q. Given that they are independent events, I would calculate P_and_Q as P * Q, resulting in approximately 0.65 * 0.25 = 0.1625.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: For this, I would use the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. This would yield approximately 0.65 + 0.25 - 0.1625 = 0.7375.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovered and Musk does not show up)**: This is a situation where Q occurs while not_P occurs.

Given his past involvement in cryptocurrency discussions, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complement of P, so it will automatically be determined by the probability assigned to P. If P is high, not_P will be low and vice versa.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I will assign it the same probability.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: The recovery of the Lunar Module is uncertain due to the challenges of locating and retrieving it from interplanetary space. Given its historical significance, there may be efforts to recover it, but I would assign a lower probability to this event compared to P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone since it requires both events to happen simultaneously. It will depend on the independence of the two events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the occurrence of either event.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered while Musk does not show up)**: This event requires Q to be true while P is false. The probability will depend on both the probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Apollo 10 given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability will depend on the assumption that if Musk does attend, it may influence the likelihood of the Lunar Module's recovery, potentially increasing it.\n\nOverall, I will evaluate the probabilities ensuring they adhere to the consistency rules provided.

Given his previous engagement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability here, perhaps around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P and should be calculated as 1 - P. Thus, if P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This question is closely related to P and should have a similar probability, as it essentially asks the same thing but in a slightly different wording. I would estimate this also around 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the Lunar Module and the challenges involved in recovering it. I would estimate a lower probability for this event, perhaps around 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events happening simultaneously is generally the product of their individual probabilities, assuming independence. However, since these events might not be entirely independent, I would adjust this probability downwards, estimating it at around 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This probability can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.25, and P_and_Q is 0.15, then P_or_Q would be 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of Lunar Module and Musk not showing up)**: This requires both events to happen. Given the probabilities, I would estimate this to be around 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability and would depend on the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered in the context of Musk's attendance. I would estimate this to be slightly higher than Q alone, perhaps around 0.30.\n\nOverall, I need to ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly regarding the relationships between P, not_P, P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and the other events.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "e71aaf82-c53b-4804-b1cc-4289690fa447", "title": "Given both Latvia and Australia qualify for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, will Poland also qualify?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where both Latvia and Australia have qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Given his significant presence in the cryptocurrency community, I estimate a moderate to high probability of him attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is likely to be very similar to P since it essentially asks the same question but in a different phrasing. Thus, I would estimate it to be around the same value as P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of the Lunar Module is highly uncertain due to its current unknown location. However, given the historical significance and ongoing interest in space exploration, I would assign a lower probability to this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q because it requires both events to happen simultaneously, which is less likely than either occurring independently.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This probability will be higher than both P and Q since it covers the scenario where at least one of the two events occurs.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk does not attend)**: This event's probability is also likely to be low, as it combines the recovery of the Lunar Module with Musk's absence, which might not be highly correlated.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will Apollo 10's Lunar Module be recovered)**: This conditional probability will lean towards the likelihood of recovery but is still uncertain due to the unknown factors surrounding the Lunar Module.\n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n- Events P and Q are independent in nature, as Musk's attendance at a conference does not directly influence the recovery of a historical artifact. However, they are related in the context of the combined questions P_and_Q and P_or_Q.\n- The probabilities must respect the consistency rules, ensuring that the relationships between the events are mathematically sound.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.75 + 0.18 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.70, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.25) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.75 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.18 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.17,\nP_or_Q: 0.78,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "34bf2493-6a97-4203-a41a-ed691ce7b0a5", "title": "Will Latvia, Australia, and Poland all qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if all of the following occur: (a) Latvia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, (b) Australia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, and (c) Poland participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

The probabilities assigned to each event must respect the logical relationships dictated by the consistency rules provided.\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This event is likely to have a moderate probability due to Musk's history with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency events. I would estimate this probability to be around 0.65, reflecting a reasonable chance of him attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complement of P, which should logically be 1 - P. Therefore, if P is 0.65, not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: Given that this is essentially the same question as P, I would assign the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10 Lunar Module)**: This event is much more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges involved in recovering it. I would estimate this probability at 0.20, reflecting a low but non-zero chance of recovery.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events happening)**: This probability must take into account the joint occurrence of P and Q. Given the independence of these events, I would estimate this at P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event happening)**: This can be calculated using the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. So, it would be 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module and Musk not showing up)**: This scenario involves both the recovery of the module and Musk not attending the conference. Assuming independence, this would be Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability might be higher than Q alone, but without specific data, I would keep it around Q, so 0.20.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities must reflect the logical relationships defined by the consistency rules. I will ensure that these probabilities respect the rules of negation, conjunction, disjunction, and conditional probability.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.16954704532721093, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04238676133180273, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7290159862729453, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Consequently, the probability that he will not show up (not_P) would be 0.40. The question about the possibility of Elon Musk attending (para_P) would likely have a similar probability as P, so I would also estimate it at 0.60.\n\nFor the question about the recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module, I would estimate a lower probability, perhaps around 0.20, due to the uncertainties surrounding its location and the challenges of recovery. Hence, the probability of not recovering it would be 0.80. The joint probability of both Musk attending and the Lunar Module being recovered (P_and_Q) should be the product of their individual probabilities, so I would estimate it at 0.12 (0.60 * 0.20).\n\nFor the question regarding either event occurring (P_or_Q), I would calculate it as 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68. The scenario where the Lunar Module is recovered and Musk does not show up (Q_and_not_P) would be estimated at 0.08 (0.20 * 0.40).\n\nThe conditional probability of recovering the Lunar Module given Musk's attendance (Q_given_P) would likely be higher than the base probability of recovering it, so I might estimate it at around 0.30.\n\nOverall, I believe that these estimates can be adjusted to ensure they respect the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.24\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "9c23caba-df4c-45c8-a8be-b762018b8c88", "title": "Conditional on Slovenia qualifying for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, will Lithuania also qualify?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where Slovenia qualifies for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

This is influenced by his interest in cryptocurrency and past engagements at similar events.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complementary event to P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would logically be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, as it assesses the likelihood of Musk attending.

The relationship between these events is crucial for determining the probabilities of combined events such as P_and_Q and P_or_Q.\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This event's likelihood can be influenced by Elon Musk's previous attendance at similar events, his current public engagements, and his interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Given Musk's involvement in the crypto space, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: Since this is the complement of P, it will be 1 - P, which would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is essentially the same event as P, so I would assign it the same probability, 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is a more uncertain event, given the challenges of locating and retrieving it. I would estimate this probability at around 0.25 based on historical recovery efforts of similar artifacts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This is a joint probability, which should be less than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q. I will estimate this at 0.15, considering that both events happening together is less likely than either happening independently.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This should be calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q. Given my estimates, this would be 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery while Musk does not show)**: This is a more complex event, and I would estimate it at 0.10, as it is plausible for the recovery to happen independently of Musk's attendance.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability might be higher if Musk's presence influences the recovery efforts positively.

Given his prior interest in Bitcoin and attendance at similar events, I might estimate this probability to be moderately high, around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is closely related to P, so I would estimate it to be similar or slightly higher, around 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Will Apollo 10's Lunar Module be recovered by 2050?)**: This is a historical artifact and its recovery is uncertain. Given the technological challenges and the timeline, I might estimate this at 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both occur: Elon Musk shows up and the Lunar Module is recovered?)**: This is the joint probability of both events occurring. Since both are somewhat independent, I might estimate this at 0.13 (0.65 * 0.20).\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either occur: Elon Musk shows up or the Lunar Module is recovered?)**: Using the formula for the union of two probabilities, I would estimate this at 0.70 (0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both occur: the Lunar Module is recovered and Elon Musk does not show up?)**: This would also be a joint probability, but since not_P is 0.35, I might estimate this at 0.07 (0.20 * 0.35).\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up, will the Lunar Module be recovered by 2050?)**: This conditional probability would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's involvement could potentially lead to increased efforts in recovery. I might estimate this at 0.25.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these events must obey the consistency rules, particularly concerning the complements and joint probabilities. I will ensure that my estimates are coherent with the given rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\nneg, and:  andor, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.1366999657593852, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0341749914398463, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.8049357898763422, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his previous engagement with cryptocurrency events, I would estimate a moderate to high probability of him attending, say around 0.65.\n\n**not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024):** This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending):** This is closely related to P, and since both refer to the same event, I would assign it the same probability as P, which is 0.65.\n\n**Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050):** The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is uncertain due to its current location being unknown. Given the historical significance and ongoing interest in space exploration, I would estimate a low probability, around 0.20.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occurring):** The occurrence of both P and Q would be less likely than either event happening independently, especially since they are not directly related. I would estimate this at around 0.10.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurring):** This would be the sum of the probabilities of P and Q minus the probability of both occurring. If P is 0.65 and Q is 0.20, then P_or_Q would be 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.10 = 0.75.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk not attending):** This scenario might also be unlikely as it combines two independent events. I would estimate this at around 0.05.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given Musk attends, will Apollo 10 be recovered):** This conditional probability would likely be higher than Q alone since Musk's attendance might increase interest and funding for space recovery efforts. I would estimate this at around 0.30.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities are interrelated, and I will ensure they adhere to the consistency rules outlined, adjusting estimates as necessary to maintain mathematical validity.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.10 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.10 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "92ae79df-c24b-40b0-b1de-d79a5cafda11", "title": "Given Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model, will Joe Biden die before Saturday?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model.

Given his past involvement in cryptocurrency discussions, I estimate a moderate to high probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complementary event to P. If the probability of P is high, then not_P will naturally be lower. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P and should have a similar probability, as both questions essentially assess the same event from slightly different angles.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of the Lunar Module is more uncertain due to the challenges of locating and retrieving it from interplanetary space. This event's probability will be lower than that of P, reflecting the complexities involved.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability will be influenced by the independence of the two events. If we assume that Musk's attendance does not affect the recovery of the Lunar Module, I can estimate this probability based on the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This will be a higher probability than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the likelihood of either event happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's recovery and Musk's absence)**: This event's probability will depend on the relationship between Q and not_P. If Q is high and not_P is also reasonably probable, this could yield a moderate probability for this combined event.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Apollo 10's Module given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability will likely reflect a lower estimate, as Musk's attendance does not necessarily impact the recovery of the Lunar Module.\n\nOverall, these events have varying degrees of interdependence, but I will ensure that my estimates respect the consistency rules provided. The probabilities will need to be adjusted based on the relationships outlined in the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.24\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.74 + 0.16 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.16 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.74 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.16 / 0.24 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.22\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "e4c5a50e-fc45-404a-a32a-7db01491bdb7", "title": "Given both Kamala's odds increase according to Nate Silver and Joe Biden dies before Saturday, will the market get 377 traders by July 15?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: (a) Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model, and (b) Joe Biden dies before Saturday. \n\n(a) Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

Given his previous involvement in cryptocurrency discussions, I would estimate a moderate probability for this event, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complementary event to P. Since the probabilities must sum to 1, if P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This question is essentially a rephrasing of P and should have the same probability, so I would set para_P to 0.60 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges in recovering it. I would estimate a lower probability, perhaps around 0.30.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: The probability of both events occurring is likely lower than either event occurring individually, so I would estimate it around 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either individual event but must also consider overlap, so I would set it around 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P occurs)**: Since Q and not_P are not directly related, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: This is a conditional probability. If Musk shows up, it might increase interest in space exploration, potentially impacting the recovery efforts for the Lunar Module. I would estimate this around 0.40.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: The events P and Q are largely independent, as Musk's attendance at the conference does not directly affect the recovery of the Lunar Module. However, they are linked in the overall context of public interest and media coverage, which could influence recovery efforts. \n\nOverall, the predictions must adhere to the consistency rules, particularly around complementary probabilities and the relationships between events.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.78,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "64f8149c-b595-4c20-89e2-4cf36191e26f", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (1) Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model and Joe Biden dies before Saturday, and (2) the linked market gets at least 377 traders by end of July 15?", "body": "(1a) Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

Given the technological advancements and interest in space exploration, I estimate this probability to be around 0.40.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both Elon Musk showing up and the Apollo 10 Lunar Module being recovered is dependent on both events happening. Since both events are somewhat independent, I can use the product of their probabilities: P * Q = 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Substituting the values gives us 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk not showing up)**: This is a combination of the two events. Assuming independence, we can calculate this as Q * not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Apollo 10 given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability. Given that Musk shows up, the interest in space exploration may increase, which could slightly improve the chances of recovery. I estimate this to be around 0.45.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these probabilities will be carefully evaluated to ensure they adhere to the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the independence of events and the logical relationships defined by the rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.15791058582441025, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.039477646456102564, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7168396910313459, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

I will evaluate the probabilities based on the context and relationships between these events.\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This prediction would be influenced by Musk's public interest in Bitcoin and prior engagements. Given his history of attending significant Bitcoin events, I would estimate a moderate to high probability.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complementary event to P. If I estimate P at a certain probability, not_P would be the remaining probability, calculated as 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is closely related to P. Since para_P is essentially a rephrasing of P, I would expect this probability to be the same as P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The probability here would depend on the ongoing efforts to locate and recover the Lunar Module. Given its historical significance, I would assign a lower probability due to the uncertainties involved in such an endeavor.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This would be the joint probability of both P and Q happening. Since these events are independent, I can calculate this as P * Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one of the events occurring)**: This would be calculated using the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events: P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This event would require both Q to be true and not_P to be true, which would also be calculated using the joint probability approach.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will the Lunar Module be recovered)**: This conditional probability would be assessed based on the assumption that P is true, which may influence the likelihood of Q.\n\nIn summary, I will assign probabilities based on these relationships and ensure they adhere to the consistency rules provided.

Given his prominence in the Bitcoin community, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at a certain level, not_P will be 1 minus that value.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is closely related to P, as it reflects a similar inquiry. I expect this to have a probability similar to P, as both events are contingent on Musk's willingness to participate.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the challenges of locating and recovering the module. Given the historical significance, I estimate a lower probability for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability is likely lower than either P or Q alone since both conditions must be met simultaneously. I consider the independence of these events; they do not affect each other directly, but their conjunction will naturally have a lower probability.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses both possibilities. I will calculate this based on the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This scenario combines the likelihood of Q occurring with the certainty that not_P is true. The relationship between these events is independent, which allows for a straightforward probability estimate.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Apollo 10's Module given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability reflects how the recovery of the Lunar Module might be perceived differently if Musk attends the conference, considering his influence in the space and technology community. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that the estimates respect the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the relationships between these probabilities, such as complements, conjunctions, and disjunctions.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.18\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.18 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.18\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "633efe00-9ec5-47f2-ac21-851a15a08902", "title": "Given Slovenia qualifies for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final and the linked market gets at least 377 traders by July 15, will Serbia qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: (a) Slovenia qualifies for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, meaning Slovenia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Given his past involvement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency events, I would assign a probability of 0.65 to this event, reflecting a moderately high likelihood based on his public interest in the subject.\n\n**not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complement of P, so it will be 1 - P. With P at 0.65, not_P would be 0.35.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This question is similar to P, and I would assign it the same probability of 0.65, as it essentially asks the same thing in a different way.\n\n**Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: Given the challenges associated with locating and recovering a lost spacecraft, I would assign a lower probability of 0.20 to this event, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the recovery efforts.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring would be calculated based on the individual probabilities of P and Q. Assuming independence, this would be P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: The probability of at least one of the two events occurring can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk not showing up)**: This event would be the product of Q and not_P, which assumes independence, giving us a probability of Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n**Q_given_P (Recovery of Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's appearance could potentially influence the recovery efforts positively. I would estimate this at 0.25, reflecting a moderate increase in likelihood due to his involvement.\n\nOverall, the probabilities assigned reflect a balance of optimism regarding Musk's involvement with Bitcoin and skepticism about the recovery of a lost spacecraft. I will ensure that these probabilities conform to the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "29c3409a-ed19-4b00-a702-813d82f8008d", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (1) Slovenia qualifies for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024 (2) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by end of July 15 (3) Serbia qualifies for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "(1) Slovenia qualifies for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final: This will resolve as Yes if Slovenia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

However, the uncertainty surrounding his schedule and commitments leads to a probability estimate of around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P, which I estimate to be 0.40 based on the probability of him not attending.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P, and since it asks about the possibility of Musk attending, I would assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module by 2050)**: The recovery of such a unique artifact is uncertain, given its current unknown location. I estimate a lower probability of 0.25 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to be true. Given the independent nature of these events, I estimate this probability as the product of P and Q, resulting in 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event requires either P or Q to be true. Using the formula for the union of two independent events, I estimate this probability as 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to be true while P is false. I estimate this probability as the product of Q and not_P, resulting in 0.25 * 0.40 = 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q given that P is true. I estimate this to be slightly higher than Q alone, say 0.30, as Musk's attendance might increase the likelihood of the Lunar Module's recovery being pursued more vigorously.\n\nOverall, the events P and Q are independent of each other, as Musk's attendance at the conference does not directly influence the recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module. Therefore, my estimates must respect the consistency rules outlined, ensuring that all relationships between these probabilities are correctly captured.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.1276739519149755, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03191848797874387, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6140256778643918, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
