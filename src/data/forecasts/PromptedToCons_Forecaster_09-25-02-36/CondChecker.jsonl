Given his history of attending such conferences, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P, calculated as 1 - P. If P is estimated at 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so it should have the same probability estimate.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This event is more uncertain as it depends on various factors including technological advancements and interest in space exploration. I estimate this probability to be lower compared to P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability will depend on the individual probabilities of P and Q. Given that they are somewhat independent, I will use the multiplication rule for independent events to calculate this.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one of the events occurs)**: This will be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. This captures the likelihood of either event occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovered and Musk does not show up)**: This probability will also be calculated based on the independence of the two events, which allows us to multiply the probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10's recovery given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability that may be influenced by the events surrounding the Bitcoin Nashville 2024.

The relationship between these events is interesting because they are not directly dependent on one another, which allows us to evaluate their probabilities independently. \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Given Elon Musk's prominence in the cryptocurrency community and his history of attending significant events, I estimate a moderate to high probability that he will attend. However, since there are many factors that could influence this, I suggest a probability of around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not attending)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it will be around 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is likely to be equal to P since they are essentially the same question framed differently. Therefore, I will set this to 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module Recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the historical nature of the artifact. I estimate a lower probability, around 0.20, reflecting the challenges involved in locating and recovering the module.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: Since P and Q are independent, I can calculate this as P * Q, which would be 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: For this, I can use the formula P + Q - P_and_Q, which gives 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered and Musk not attending)**: This can also be calculated as Q * not_P, so it would be 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk attends)**: I can estimate this as Q, since Musk's attendance does not directly impact the recovery of the Lunar Module. Therefore, I will set this to 0.20 as well.\n\nOverall, these estimates should satisfy the consistency rules, as I have carefully considered the relationships and independence of the events.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q) cond, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c183fd7c-acbc-4998-9fe9-3d2b1e75ade9", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?

Given his popularity and the significance of the event, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for him showing up.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so I estimate it at 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This question is similar to P but framed to assess the possibility rather than certainty. I estimate this to be slightly higher than P, at 0.68, reflecting a broader scope of possibilities.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: Given the historical significance and the technological challenges of recovering a lost lunar module, I estimate a lower probability of 0.20 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events happening)**: Since both events are independent, I calculate this as P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event happening)**: This can be calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72. This reflects the likelihood of at least one of the two events occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module and Musk not showing up)**: This can be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07, indicating the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered while Musk does not attend the event.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability that reflects how the occurrence of one event might influence the other. Given the independence of the events, I estimate this at 0.20, the same as Q.\n\nIn terms of consistency rules, I will ensure that the probabilities adhere to the mathematical relationships outlined in the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the relationships between the probabilities of independent events, complements, and conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.68,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.68 is FALSE\n\nneg, and, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.03922540916266045, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.013075136387553483, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.29782275010961673, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given Musk's history with Bitcoin and public appearances, I estimate a moderate probability of this happening.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P, so its probability should align with the estimate of P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is effectively the same as P, so I expect it to have a similar probability.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module by 2050)**: This is a highly uncertain event due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges associated with space recovery missions. I would assign a lower probability to this event given the complexities involved.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will depend on the individual probabilities of P and Q. If both events are relatively independent, I can estimate this using the product of their probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This will involve the sum of the individual probabilities minus the joint occurrence (P_and_Q). \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovered while Musk does not show up)**: This scenario requires careful consideration of the independence of the two events. If they are independent, I can calculate this as the product of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability should take into account how the occurrence of P might influence Q. Given that these events are somewhat independent, I would expect this to be close to the original estimate of Q.\n\nOverall, the probabilities must satisfy the consistency rules provided, particularly regarding the relationships between the events (e.g., complementarity for not_P, independence for P_and_Q, and the bounds for P_or_Q).

Given these factors, I estimate a moderate to high probability that he will attend. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If my estimate for P is high, not_P will be correspondingly low. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This question is closely related to P, as it essentially asks the same thing but in a different wording. Therefore, the probability should reflect a similar estimate as P. \n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This question relies on the historical significance of the Lunar Module and ongoing efforts to locate it. Given the challenges and uncertainties involved, I would estimate a lower probability for this event compared to P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as it represents the intersection of both events occurring simultaneously. Given that both events are independent, the probability can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the possibility of either event occurring.

Given his past involvement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability of him attending, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Since this is essentially the same question as P, I would assign it the same probability, 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is a more uncertain event, as it depends on various factors including technological advancements and interest in space exploration. Given the historical significance of the module, I would estimate a lower probability, perhaps around 0.30.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This would be the joint probability of both events occurring. Assuming P and Q are somewhat independent, I would multiply their probabilities, estimating around 0.65 * 0.30 = 0.195.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, it would be 0.65 + 0.30 - 0.195 = 0.755.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovered and Musk does not show up)**: This combines the probabilities of both events occurring, which would be Q * not_P. Thus, it would be 0.30 * 0.35 = 0.105.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will the Lunar Module be recovered)**: This conditional probability would depend on how likely I think the recovery of the Lunar Module is if Musk attends. Assuming attendance could positively influence interest in space exploration, I might estimate this at a higher probability, perhaps 0.40.\n\nOverall, these estimates need to be checked against the consistency rules to ensure they hold mathematically. I will ensure that the values I assign do not violate any of the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.195,\nP_or_Q: 0.755,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.755 + 0.195 - 0.30 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.195 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.755 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.755 - 0.105 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.195 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nandor, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.195,\nP_or_Q: 0.755,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.07011802097404737, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.02337267365801579, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.40516337191403173, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For example, not_P must equal 1 - P, and the relationships between P, Q, and their combinations must hold true according to the rules of probability.\n- The independence of P and Q is a critical assumption that allows us to calculate joint probabilities simply as products.\n\n### Summary:\n- The predictions are based on estimated probabilities that consider historical context and trends related to both Elon Musk's public appearances and the recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module. Each variable's probability should be checked against the consistency rules to ensure they align properly.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nTo correct the consistency violations, I will adjust the probabilities while ensuring that all consistency rules are satisfied.\n\n1. **Adjusting not_P**: Since not_P = 1 - P, I will keep not_P as 0.35.\n\n2. **Adjusting Q**: The value of Q will be kept at 0.20.\n\n3. **Adjusting P_and_Q**: The value of P_and_Q should be adjusted to satisfy the rule: P_and_Q = P * Q, which gives P_and_Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13. This satisfies the product rule for independent events.\n\n4. **Adjusting P_or_Q**: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, so P_or_Q should be adjusted to 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72. This satisfies the OR rule.\n\n5. **Adjusting Q_and_not_P**: This can be recalculated as Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n6. **Adjusting Q_given_P**: Since Q_given_P should equal Q when P is true, I will keep Q_given_P as 0.20.\n\nAfter these adjustments, all consistency rules will be checked again to ensure they hold true. \n\nFinal estimates are as follows:\n\n\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "40414a69-b251-49cf-a0aa-579a9db31726", "title": "Conditional on Donald Trump Jr. being the Republican nominee, will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if Donald Trump Jr. is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given the significance of the event, I would estimate a moderate to high probability of him attending, around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P. Therefore, it should be estimated as 1 - P, which would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would assign it the same probability, 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This event is highly uncertain due to the unknown location of the module and the challenges associated with space recovery. A lower probability estimate, around 0.20, seems appropriate.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: The probability of both events occurring together would be the product of their individual probabilities if we assume independence, so P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events, P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This can be calculated as Q * not_P, which gives us Q_and_not_P = Q * (1 - P) = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given that P occurs)**: This is a conditional probability. Assuming that if Musk attends, it might increase the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered, I might estimate this at a slightly higher probability than Q alone, around 0.25.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that all estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly concerning the relationships between P, not_P, P_and_Q, and P_or_Q.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "305b931a-52a7-4ae6-ad5d-7c4e6ac79fcc", "title": "Will both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson are selected by the Republican National Convention as nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given the significance of the event, I would estimate a moderate to high probability for this happening.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P to be moderately high, then not_P will be lower but still plausible.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is similar to P, and I would expect it to have a similar probability since it essentially asks the same question in a different form.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This event is uncertain due to the unknown status of the Lunar Module and the challenges associated with space recovery missions. I would assign a lower probability here.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone since it requires both events to happen. I will calculate this based on the individual probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than both P and Q since it allows for either outcome to resolve positively.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This is a combination of Q and not_P, so it will depend on the individual probabilities of these two events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability will likely be higher than Q alone, as the presence of Musk could potentially influence interest or resources directed towards the recovery of the Lunar Module.\n\nI will ensure that the estimates respect the consistency rules outlined, particularly the relationships between P, not_P, Q, and their combinations.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.74 + 0.16 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.16 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.74 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.16 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.05344806657787696, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.017816022192625652, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3507323215972475, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This is influenced by his past engagements in similar events.\n\n**not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P, and thus should be consistent with the value assigned to P.\n\n**para_P (Possibility that Elon Musk will attend)**: This is essentially the same as P, so the probability should be aligned with it.\n\n**Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This event is less certain given the historical context and the challenges of space recovery. The likelihood is lower than that of Musk attending the conference.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Musk attends and the Lunar Module is recovered)**: The probability of both events occurring is dependent on the individual probabilities of P and Q. Given that they are independent events, this value should be the product of the probabilities of P and Q.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either Musk attends or the Lunar Module is recovered)**: This probability should reflect the likelihood of at least one of the events occurring and can be calculated using the formula for the union of two independent events.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Lunar Module recovery and Musk not attending)**: This will also depend on the probabilities of Q and not_P being true. \n\n**Q_given_P (Lunar Module recovery given Musk attends)**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered if Musk attends the conference. It may suggest a correlation between the two events, although they are inherently independent.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events must adhere to the consistency rules provided. The independence of P and Q allows for straightforward calculations regarding their joint and conditional probabilities.

Thus, P_and_Q would be 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This would be calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q, so P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module and Musk not attending)**: This would be a more complex calculation, but assuming independence, it could be estimated as Q * not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This might increase the probability of recovery due to heightened interest and attention.

Given the significance of the conference and his interest in Bitcoin, I would estimate a moderate probability of him attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: By the nature of binary questions, this is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at a certain probability, not_P would be 1 minus that probability.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially a rephrased version of P, so I would expect this probability to be the same as P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: This is a much more uncertain event, as it involves complex factors like ongoing space exploration efforts and the historical significance of the Lunar Module. I would estimate a lower probability for this event due to the unknowns involved.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring is generally the product of their independent probabilities, assuming they are independent. However, if there is any correlation, this needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability can be calculated using the formula for the union of two events, which is P + Q - P_and_Q. This gives a higher likelihood than either event occurring alone.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovery and Musk not attending)**: This would be the intersection of Q and not_P, which would require careful consideration of how these events might influence one another.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo 10 recovery given Musk attends)**: This conditional probability would depend on how the two events might be related. If Musk's attendance somehow influences the recovery efforts, this would need to be factored into the estimate.\n\nOverall, I need to ensure that the estimates I provide adhere to the consistency rules laid out, particularly regarding complements, intersections, and unions of probabilities.

I estimate this probability at 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both Musk attend and the Lunar Module be recovered?)**: Since both events are independent, I estimate this probability as the product of P and Q, leading to 0.65 * 0.25 = 0.1625, rounded to 0.16.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either Musk attend or the Lunar Module be recovered?)**: This is calculated using the formula for the union of two independent events: P + Q - P_and_Q, yielding 0.65 + 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.74.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will the Lunar Module be recovered and Musk not attend?)**: This reflects the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered while Musk is absent. I estimate this as Q * not_P = 0.25 * 0.35 = 0.0875, rounded to 0.09.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will the Lunar Module be recovered?)**: This probability may be influenced by Musk's presence potentially increasing interest or funding for space recovery efforts. I estimate this at 0.30.\n\nOverall, I believe these estimates reflect a careful consideration of the events' likelihoods and their interdependencies.

Given his prominence in the Bitcoin community and past engagements, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P.

Given its historical significance, there may be a reasonable chance of recovery, but I would estimate this probability lower than P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be lower than both P and Q since it requires the occurrence of both events simultaneously. I will use the multiplication rule for independent events to estimate this.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This will be higher than either P or Q since it captures the possibility of either event happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's recovery and Musk not attending)**: This scenario combines the recovery of the Lunar Module with Musk's absence, which may have a specific probability based on the independence of the two events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk's attendance)**: This conditional probability will depend on the correlation between Musk attending and the recovery of the Lunar Module.

This question asks: by 1 January 2050, will the lost ascent stage of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module be recovered (i.e. located, captured, and physically transported to some location where humans have a presence at that time, such as Earth, the Moon, Mars or elsewhere) successfully?

After 'dress rehearsal' testing in lunar orbit, during which the Lunar Module came within 8.4 nautical miles of the lunar surface, the ascent engine performed a burn to depletion which sent the craft into interplanetary space and the vehicle is currently in a heliocentric orbit.

Given his prominence and interest in Bitcoin, I estimate a relatively high probability of him attending the event. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at a certain value, not_P will automatically be calculated as 1 - P. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This is expected to align closely with P, as it essentially asks the same question with slightly different wording. \n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10 Lunar Module)**: This event is much more uncertain due to the unknowns surrounding the location of the module and the challenges of space recovery. Given the historical significance of the module, I would assign a lower probability to this event compared to P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will depend on the individual probabilities of P and Q. Since these events are independent, I can calculate this as P * Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. It accounts for the overlap between the two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while P does not)**: This considers the recovery of the Lunar Module while Musk does not attend the conference, which is also independent and can be calculated accordingly.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given P)**: This is a conditional probability that considers the likelihood of the Lunar Module being recovered if Musk attends the conference. While there may be some correlation, it is not strong enough to drastically change the probability of Q based on P.\n\nThe relationships between these probabilities are crucial for ensuring consistency. For example, if P is high, not_P must be low, and if P_and_Q is calculated based on P and Q, it must reflect the actual likelihood of both events occurring simultaneously. \n\nOverall, my estimates will be grounded in these relationships, ensuring that all outputs respect the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.17\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.07011802097404737, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.02337267365801579, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.40516337191403173, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
