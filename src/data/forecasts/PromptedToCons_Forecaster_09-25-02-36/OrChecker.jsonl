If I estimate P at a certain value, not_P will be 1 minus that value.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This probability is aligned with P, as it essentially asks the same question in a slightly different wording. Therefore, I expect this to have a similar probability estimate as P.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module is uncertain due to its unknown location and the challenges associated with space recovery missions.

Since both events are independent, I would calculate this as the product of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This will be calculated using the formula for the union of two probabilities. It reflects the likelihood that at least one of the events occurs.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module is recovered and Elon Musk does not show up)**: This will also be calculated based on the independence of the two events. It combines the probability of Q with not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will Apollo 10's Module be recovered)**: This is a conditional probability. If I believe that Musk\u2019s attendance increases the likelihood of the recovery, I will estimate this probability higher than Q alone. \n\n**Independence and Relationship**: The events P (Musk attending) and Q (Lunar Module recovery) are independent in nature.

Given his history of involvement in cryptocurrency discussions, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for him attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, as it asks if there's a possibility of him attending the conference. Therefore, I assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: Considering the historical significance of the Lunar Module and ongoing efforts to locate it, I estimate a lower probability of 0.30 for its recovery by 2050.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The joint occurrence of both events is less likely. Given the individual probabilities, I estimate this at 0.20.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This requires adding the probabilities of P and Q while subtracting the probability of both occurring together. I estimate this at 0.65.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module and Musk not showing up)**: This is more complex, but I estimate it at 0.10, reflecting the independent nature of the two events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability could be influenced by Musk's potential interest in space exploration, so I estimate it at 0.25.\n\nIn terms of consistency, I will ensure that the estimates adhere to the rules provided, particularly ensuring that the probabilities of complementary events (P and not_P) sum to 1, and that the joint probabilities respect the independence or dependence of the events. \n\nOverall, while P and Q are independent events, their joint probabilities need careful consideration to ensure they reflect realistic outcomes based on historical context and current events.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.20,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "95b9093e-1f86-4375-9015-4c2399d88f66", "title": "Will either Donald Trump Jr. or Nikki Haley be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Donald Trump Jr. or Nikki Haley is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

I might estimate this probability at around 0.25. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring would be lower than either individual event. Assuming independence for simplicity, P_and_Q would be calculated as P * Q = 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This would be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, which would give us 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovered and Musk does not show up)**: Assuming independence again, this would be Q * not_P = 0.25 * 0.40 = 0.10. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will the Lunar Module be recovered)**: This could be influenced by Musk's presence, but I would keep it the same as Q for simplicity, so I would estimate it at 0.25. \n\nOverall, I would ensure that the estimates respect the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, and their combinations with Q.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.002670692257312257, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.000890230752437419, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his prominence in the cryptocurrency community, I might assign a relatively high probability to this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at a certain level, not_P will be 1 minus that value.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is expected to be similar to P since both questions revolve around the same event and conditions.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: This will be a more uncertain estimate due to the historical and logistical challenges associated with locating and recovering an object in interplanetary space. Given the unknowns, this probability may be lower than P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will depend on the independence of P and Q. If I assume they are independent, I can calculate this as P * Q. If they are dependent, I will need to adjust accordingly.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. If both probabilities are high, this may lead to a higher estimate for this combined event.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the module while Musk does not show up)**: This is a more specific scenario and will also depend on the relationship between P and Q. If they are independent, I can calculate this as Q * not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability will rely on whether Musk's attendance influences the likelihood of the module's recovery. If I believe it does, this probability may be higher than Q alone.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that my estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between these events, especially in terms of independence and conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.18\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.18 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.18\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given the popularity of the event, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it should equal 1 - P. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, as it reflects the likelihood of Musk attending the event. Given that para_P is essentially a rephrased version of P, it should have a similar probability. \n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: The recovery of a historical artifact is uncertain, but given ongoing interest and efforts, I would estimate a low probability that this will happen by 2050.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This represents the joint occurrence of both events. Since these events are independent, the probability is calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is the probability of at least one of the events occurring. Given the independence of P and Q, this can be calculated using the formula for the union of two independent events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Recovery of the Lunar Module and Musk not showing up)**: This event combines the recovery of the Lunar Module with Musk's non-attendance. The probabilities can be calculated similarly to P_and_Q, considering the independence of events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery given Musk shows up)**: This conditional probability reflects whether the recovery of the Lunar Module is influenced by Musk's attendance. Given that these events are not directly related, I would expect this probability to be close to Q.\n\nOverall, the events are somewhat independent, especially P and Q, which allows us to use the formulas for combining probabilities without concern for mutual influence.

I estimate this probability at around 0.65, reflecting a moderate expectation of his presence.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, suggesting that the public sentiment and potential for Musk's attendance are high. I estimate this at 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: The odds of recovering such a historical artifact are low, given the uncertainties surrounding its location. I estimate this at 0.15.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability is dependent on both P and Q being true. Given the lower probability of Q, I estimate this at around 0.10.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is higher because it allows for the occurrence of either event. I estimate this at 0.70, reflecting the combined chances of either Musk attending or the Lunar Module being recovered.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Lunar Module recovered and Musk not attending)**: This would also have a low probability since it combines the low probability of Q with the certainty of not P. I estimate this at around 0.05.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Recovery of Lunar Module given Musk's attendance)**: This probability might be slightly higher than Q alone, as Musk's attendance could potentially influence recovery efforts through increased interest or funding. I estimate this at around 0.20.\n\nIn summary, while P and Q are independent events, the relationships between them can affect the overall estimates, especially with the conditional probabilities. I ensured that my estimates respect the consistency rules, particularly regarding complements and combinations of events.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.10 - 0.15 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.15 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.65, 0.15) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.15) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.15) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.10 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and:  andor, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "90699df8-79f6-47bc-8f4c-bf8f4a6e41af", "title": "Will either Nikki Haley or Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Nikki Haley or Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

I estimate this to be moderately high due to his strong interest in cryptocurrency.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is high, not_P will be low, reflecting the binary nature of the question.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Musk attending)**: This question is closely related to P and should have a similar probability since it essentially asks the same thing but in a different phrasing. I expect it to be slightly higher than P due to the wording suggesting possibility rather than certainty.\n\n4. **Q (Recovery of Apollo 10's Lunar Module)**: The recovery of the Lunar Module is a more uncertain event, given the unknown location and the technical challenges involved. I estimate this probability to be lower than P due to the complexities of space recovery missions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This event requires both P and Q to be true.

Given Musk's past involvement with cryptocurrency, I would estimate this probability to be relatively high.\n\n2. **Event not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P, so its probability will be directly related to the estimate of P. If P is high, not_P will be low.\n\n3. **Event para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is similar to P and should have a similar probability, as it essentially asks if there is any possibility of his attendance.\n\n4. **Event Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the unknown location of the Lunar Module and the challenges involved in recovering it. Thus, I would estimate this probability to be lower than that of P.\n\n5. **Event P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events occurring is likely lower than either event happening individually, as they are independent events. Therefore, the estimate for this probability should reflect that.\n\n6. **Event P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either event occurring individually, as it encompasses both possibilities.\n\n7. **Event Q_and_not_P (Apollo 10 recovered, but Musk does not show up)**: This event's probability would depend on the relationship between Q and not_P, which are independent. Thus, it should be a product of their individual probabilities.\n\n8. **Event Q_given_P (If Musk shows up, will Apollo 10 be recovered)**: This conditional probability may be influenced by whether Musk's presence at the conference has any bearing on the recovery efforts for the Lunar Module. However, I would expect it to be relatively independent.\n\nOverall, the probabilities should reflect the relationships and independence between these events, ensuring compliance with the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.18\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.18 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.18\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6b1a778b-0cb9-4935-91c5-f4ca0a59f755", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

These events are independent of each other, meaning the occurrence of one does not directly affect the occurrence of the other. \n\n### Probability Estimates: \n1. **P (Elon Musk shows up)**: The likelihood of Elon Musk attending a high-profile Bitcoin conference is relatively high given his past involvement in the cryptocurrency space. I estimate this at 0.65.\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This would be the complement of P, so it would be 0.35.\n3. **para_P (Possibility of attendance)**: Since this is essentially the same question as P, I estimate this also at 0.65.\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: The recovery of the Apollo 10 Lunar Module is a more uncertain event due to the challenges in locating and retrieving it. I estimate this at 0.20.\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: Since P and Q are independent, this can be calculated as P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Apollo recovery and Musk not showing up)**: This can also be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n8. **Q_given_P (Apollo recovery given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability, and since the events are independent, it remains the same as Q, which is 0.20.\n\n### Consistency Checks:\n- **neg**: P = 1 - not_P holds true as 0.65 = 1 - 0.35.\n- **andor**: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q holds true as 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20.\n- **and**: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q) should be evaluated.

Given his prominence in the cryptocurrency space, I might estimate a moderate to high probability.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P. If P is estimated to be high, not_P will be correspondingly low.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is similar to P, so I would set it at a similar probability, indicating a strong possibility.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10's Lunar Module recovery by 2050)**: The recovery of the Lunar Module depends on technological advancements and interest in space exploration. Given the historical significance, I would assign a lower probability here, as the recovery is uncertain and may depend on future missions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: This event would require both P and Q to be true. The joint probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as both events happening simultaneously is less likely.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q alone since it encompasses both events occurring independently.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while P does not)**: This is a specific combination that would require Q to happen while Musk does not show up. The probability would depend on the independence of these events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P has occurred)**: This conditional probability will depend on how likely Q is if P is true. If Musk's attendance positively influences space exploration interest, this probability could be higher.\n\nIn summary, I will need to balance these probabilities while ensuring they comply with the consistency rules provided. The relationships between these events are crucial, especially since P and Q are independent events, but their combinations will need careful consideration.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.74 + 0.16 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.16 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.74 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.16 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

These events are independent of each other, as one pertains to a specific event in the cryptocurrency community while the other is related to space exploration history. \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: Given Musk's active engagement with the cryptocurrency community, particularly Bitcoin, I estimate a relatively high probability for this event. However, factors such as scheduling conflicts or personal decisions could influence this, leading to a probability of around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P = 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is essentially a rephrasing of P, so it should have the same probability estimate as P, which is 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Apollo 10 Lunar Module recovery)**: This event is more uncertain due to the historical nature of the module and the challenges involved in locating and recovering it. Given the current unknowns, I would estimate a lower probability, around 0.25.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This represents the joint occurrence of both events. Since both events are independent, we can calculate this as P * Q. Thus, P_and_Q = 0.65 * 0.25 = 0.1625.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.25 - 0.1625 = 0.7375.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This represents the occurrence of Q while P does not happen. Since Q and not_P are independent, we can calculate this as Q * not_P = 0.25 * 0.35 = 0.0875.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability is more complex, but since P is happening, it may influence the probability of Q. However, without specific data on the correlation between these two events, I would estimate this to be around 0.25, as the recovery of the module is largely independent of Musk's appearance.\n\nIn summary, the events are independent, and the probabilities reflect the uncertainty and the nature of each question, with a higher probability for P due to Musk's public persona and lower for Q due to the historical and logistical challenges involved.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.74 + 0.16 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.16 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.74 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.16 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and:  or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
