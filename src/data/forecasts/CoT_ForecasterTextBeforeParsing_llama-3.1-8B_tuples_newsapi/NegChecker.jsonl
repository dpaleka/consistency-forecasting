Historical context: Columbia University has faced controversies and protests related to the naming of its buildings in the past. For example, the university removed the name of John Bingham Huddleston from a dormitory in 2020 due to his ties to slavery. This suggests that the university is willing to reconsider the naming of its buildings in response to public pressure. 2. Current debates and discussions: There are ongoing debates and discussions about the naming of Columbia University's buildings, particularly with regards to the presence of names associated with slavery, colonialism, and other forms of oppression. These discussions may lead to increased public pressure on the university to remove certain names. 3. Public pressure and activism: The past few years have seen a significant increase in public pressure and activism on college campuses across the United States, with many institutions removing or renaming buildings and other structures due to concerns about their historical associations. This trend suggests that public pressure can be an effective force in driving change. 4. University's response to public pressure: While Columbia University has not explicitly stated that it will not remove any names, it has also not made any public announcements about removing names due to public pressure. This lack of clarity may indicate that the university is waiting to see how the situation develops or is trying to avoid taking a stance. 5. News coverage and reporting: The question specifies that the removal of a name must be reported by at least two reputable news sources to be considered a YES resolution. This suggests that the university's decision will be closely watched by the media, and any removal of a name will likely be widely reported. Considering these factors, I believe that there is a moderate likelihood that Columbia University will remove an individual's name from its buildings due to public pressure by August 2024.

To assess this question, we need to evaluate the likelihood of any public pressure leading to official removals and whether any such removals will be formally announced by Columbia University before the end of August 2024. 2. The question's resolution also depends on the explicit statements from Columbia University regarding the removal of names from their buildings. 3.

On the other hand, if the company has shown a willingness to license its patents or negotiate with generic manufacturers in the past, it may be more likely that they will allow generic production in the future. Next, I will examine the current market and competitive landscape for COPD medications. If there are many generic manufacturers already producing similar medications and competing in the market, it may be more likely that Boehringer Ingelheim will allow generic production to maintain market share and competitiveness. Conversely, if the market is less competitive, the company may be more likely to maintain its patent protection. Additionally, I will look at any recent statements or announcements from the company regarding its patent enforcement strategy for its COPD medication. If the company has recently stated its intention to continue enforcing its patent, it is more likely that they will not allow generic production.

Past announcements: LG has made public statements about its AI ambitions and investments in the past, which suggests a willingness to communicate its intentions and plans to the public. 4. Current market conditions: The global economy is experiencing a period of uncertainty, and companies may be cautious about making significant announcements. However, LG's decision to increase its AI-related workforce might be driven by the need to stay competitive and adapt to changing market conditions. 5. The resolution date is relatively far in the future, which allows for a degree of uncertainty. However, it also gives LG sufficient time to make a decision and prepare for the announcement. Considering these factors, I believe that LG is likely to announce plans to increase its AI-related workforce by July 2024, given its past behavior, industry trends, and the company's focus on AI."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "cdd5da31-5bc9-4aa7-8974-915319f7bac2", "title": "Will LG not announce plans to increase its AI-related workforce by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, LG does not publicly announce plans to increase its AI-related workforce.

LG, a South Korean multinational conglomerate, has been actively investing in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development, particularly in areas such as smart homes, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. The company's AI strategy is likely driven by its goal to become a leader in the technology sector and to improve its competitiveness in various markets. However, the decision to increase the AI-related workforce might depend on various factors such as market trends, technological advancements, and the company's financial situation. If LG's competitors are also investing heavily in AI, it might feel pressure to maintain its current workforce or even decrease it to stay competitive. Additionally, the company might be evaluating its current workforce structure and deciding whether to reallocate resources to other areas. Given these considerations, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether LG will announce plans to increase its AI-related workforce by July 2024. However, I will consider the following points: 1. LG's commitment to AI research and development: LG has demonstrated a strong commitment to AI, and it's likely that the company will continue to invest in this area. 2. The company's financial situation: LG's financial performance might influence its decisions regarding workforce expansion.

In practice, governments often have fluctuating political climates, natural crises, or unforeseen international tensions that can arise but such information isn\u2019t detailed in the prompt which typically suggest a relatively routine bilateral process. 3. News and international affairs coverage: The lack of news sources reporting a major agreement typically suggests either such a news is either mundane (standard bilateral cooperation continuing), no significant change between countries was agreed upon due to unforeseen factors from within and outside of involved nations (which isn't clearly known), or information about major new initiatives got not disclosed publicly by said news channels. 4. Form of cooperation examples: A new form can indeed involve emerging technologies as part of joint ventures such as satellite communications, software or apps development for different fields and so on among which we can have for instance Italy and Australia making new AI for education jointly for international use which certainly might attract attention but other, lower profile cooperation examples would lack the public reach which also makes this very possible.

This suggests that the state has a history of restricting access to abortion. 2. The current composition of the Alabama Senate: As of the 2022 election, the Alabama Senate is controlled by Republicans, who are generally more likely to support restrictive abortion laws. However, there are still some moderate Republicans and independents who may be opposed to a total abortion ban. 3.

Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) effectively overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to enact their own abortion laws. This decision may embolden Alabama lawmakers to pass a total abortion ban, but it also increases the likelihood of legal challenges. 5.

However, considering the ongoing debate and polarization surrounding abortion rights in the US, it's possible that the Senate might not pass such legislation, especially if there's significant opposition from Democrats or moderate Republicans.

A failure to condemn the attack could be seen as tacit approval or complicity, which could further polarize the Venezuelan political situation and potentially harm Maduro's international reputation. Given these factors, I believe that Maduro's decision to publicly condemn the attack will depend on a variety of factors, including his assessment of the potential costs and benefits of doing so, as well as any potential pressure from international actors or domestic stakeholders. In terms of the likelihood of Maduro making a public statement condemning the attack, I will consider the following: The fact that Maduro has a history of being critical of opposition leaders and movements, which suggests that he may be unlikely to publicly condemn the attack; The potential consequences of not condemning the attack, which could include further polarization and international criticism; The fact that Maduro's government has been known to be responsive to international pressure, which suggests that he may be more likely to condemn the attack if there is sufficient international pressure to do so.

Since the outbreak began in 2023, we can assume that the situation is ongoing, but the number of deaths might be decreasing as time passes. However, this is just an assumption and not a reliable estimate. Secondly, we need to consider the reporting rate of cholera-related deaths in Sudan. If the reporting rate is high, it's more likely that the actual number of deaths is close to the reported number.

Thirdly, we need to consider the reliability of the sources mentioned in the question. Sudanese health authorities, the World Health Organization (WHO), and reputable international news agencies (such as Reuters, Associated Press, or BBC) are generally reliable sources of information.

However, the question also specifies that the grants must be allocated for electric vehicle-related projects, which may limit the pool of potential funding. Given the importance of electric vehicle initiatives in the U.S. government's climate and energy policies, it is possible that Volvo could receive a significant amount of funding for electric vehicle-related projects.

The rapid development and distribution of vaccines, as well as the implementation of contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine measures, have been crucial in controlling the spread of mpox. If these measures have been effective in reducing the number of cases and slowing the spread of the virus, it is more likely that the outbreak will be declared over by the given deadline. Secondly, the level of public awareness and adherence to health guidelines will also play a significant role. If the public remains vigilant and follows recommended health measures, such as vaccination, mask-wearing, and social distancing, it will be easier for the CDC to declare the outbreak over. Thirdly, the global health landscape and the presence of other infectious diseases will also impact the likelihood of the outbreak being declared over. If there are other pressing health concerns, the CDC may prioritize resources and attention towards those issues, potentially delaying the declaration of the mpox outbreak. Lastly, the availability of data and the CDC's criteria for declaring the outbreak over will also influence the likelihood of the declaration.

This suggests that the state has a history of restrictive abortion laws and may be inclined to hold a referendum on the issue. 2. Current political climate: The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, and abortion rights have become a highly polarized issue. Given the increasing polarization, it's possible that Texas politicians may try to capitalize on this issue to mobilize their base or appeal to swing voters. 3. Recent developments: In recent months, there have been efforts to gather signatures for a potential referendum on abortion rights in Texas. However, as per the question's resolution criteria, merely gathering signatures does not qualify for a YES resolution; the actual referendum must be scheduled or held within the specified timeframe. 4. State legislative process: To hold a referendum, the Texas state legislature would need to pass a bill authorizing the referendum, which would then need to be signed into law by the Governor. Given the current partisan divide in the Texas legislature, it's unclear whether such a bill would pass. 5. Timing: The question specifies that the referendum must be officially announced by the Texas Secretary of State or other appropriate state election authority and scheduled to take place on or before August 31, 2024. This leaves a relatively short window for the state legislature to pass a bill authorizing the referendum and for the necessary preparations to be made. Considering these factors, while there are some indications that Texas may be inclined to hold a referendum on abortion rights, the state's legislative process and the short timeframe for holding a referendum make it a challenging task. Therefore, I estimate the probability of Texas holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024 as follows:"}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "88410d47-bf5d-4ae4-ad41-fea6ec615bc5", "title": "Will Texas not hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, the state of Texas does not officially conduct a public referendum specifically focused on enshrining protection for abortion rights in the state constitution or law.

The question specifies that merely gathering signatures for a potential referendum does not qualify for a YES resolution. This means that the actual referendum must be scheduled or held within the specified timeframe. 2. The question also states that the referendum must be officially announced by the Texas Secretary of State or other appropriate state election authority, or scheduled to take place on or before August 31, 2024. This suggests that there are specific bureaucratic channels that a referendum would need to go through to be officially recognized. 3. Considering the current political climate in Texas, which is generally conservative, it is possible that there may be opposition to holding a referendum on abortion rights. 4. However, there is also a possibility that pro-choice groups or organizations may attempt to gather signatures for a referendum, which could potentially be officially announced or scheduled within the given timeframe. Taking these points into account, it seems that the likelihood of a referendum being officially announced or conducted by August 31, 2024, is relatively low, but not negligible.

These include inflation, economic growth, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and the overall state of the housing market. First, I'll consider the current economic environment. As of June 2024, the US economy is experiencing a moderate growth rate, with the GDP growth rate around 2.5%. This growth rate is higher than the long-term average, but not alarmingly high. Inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is also moderate, around 2.2%. These factors suggest that the Federal Reserve might maintain its current monetary policy, which could keep mortgage rates stable. However, I'll also consider the historical trend of mortgage rates. In recent years, mortgage rates have been influenced by the Federal Reserve's actions, particularly the 2022 rate hikes. Although the Fed has paused its rate hikes, it's likely to continue monitoring inflation and adjust its policy as needed. This could lead to further rate increases, potentially pushing the average rate on a 15-year mortgage above 5.5%. Another factor to consider is the overall state of the housing market. The housing market has been experiencing a moderate slowdown, with prices stabilizing and sales declining slightly. This could lead to a decrease in demand for mortgages, which might contribute to lower rates. However, the current mortgage rates are still relatively low compared to historical averages, and the demand for housing is still strong. Given these factors, I'll estimate the probability of the average rate on a 15-year mortgage exceeding 5.5% by August 2024.

Public opposition: There may be concerns among local residents or environmental groups about the impact of events on citrus orchards, which could lead to opposition to policy changes. 4. Lack of precedent: I couldn't find any information on previous policy changes or announcements by local authorities in Riverside County allowing events on citrus orchards. 5. Timeframe: The question resolves by July 31, 2024, which is relatively soon. This suggests that any policy change would need to be implemented quickly, which may be challenging. Considering these factors, I believe that the probability of Riverside County not authorizing events on citrus orchards by July 2024 is relatively high. However, it's impossible to predict with certainty the actions of local authorities or the outcome of any potential policy changes."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09889016196089284, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04944508098044642, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.45433689961153706, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, if the dispute is more complex, involving deeply held principles or systemic issues, it may be more challenging to reach a resolution before August 2024. Next, I'll consider the history of past labor disputes in Switzerland. If there have been instances where strikes have been resolved quickly, this might suggest a more optimistic outlook. Conversely, if past disputes have taken longer to resolve, it may indicate a more pessimistic outlook. Additionally, I'll examine the current economic and political climate in Switzerland. A strong economy and a stable government could potentially lead to a more favorable environment for negotiations and a quicker resolution to the strike. On the other hand, economic downturns or political instability could exacerbate the situation, prolonging the strike.

Both processes, which are typically lengthy and have multiple hurdles, need to be concluded before any such referendum is scheduled or put to the public for approval.

Therefore, it is probable that the performance is officially confirmed by the Outside Lands Music Festival organizers (criterion 1 is unlikely to be met). Secondly, as a member of Blackpink, Lisa has performed with the group in various contexts, including music festivals.

Given her status as a prominent K-pop star, it is likely that she would take advantage of opportunities to perform with her group or other artists, which would satisfy criterion 2. Thirdly, the event is scheduled to take place in San Francisco, so criterion 3 is unlikely to be met. Lastly, reputable news sources often cover high-profile events like the Outside Lands Music Festival, and it is likely that Lisa's performance, if it occurs, would be reported by at least two reputable news sources, making criterion 4 unlikely to be met.

Historically, the FDA's budget has been subject to fluctuations, with some years seeing significant increases and others experiencing cuts. The current political landscape in the U.S. Senate is complex, with various factors influencing the likelihood of a budget increase. The Senate has a history of passing legislation that supports public health initiatives, and the FDA plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of food and drugs. However, the Senate is also known for its gridlock and partisanship, which can hinder the passage of legislation.

The US government's plans and potential implementation timeline of the specific program addressing historical discrimination against minority artists, which, at the moment, aren't publicly detailed. 2. The progress of funding for this purpose, that can be also difficult to discern without exact information of current budget planning. 3. The operational capacity, which might limit the implementation and the reach of programs. It is unknown what specific strategies the Department of Arts and Culture plan to use and how resources have been dedicated to making such a target achievable. While there might be political pressures to take action (because of general public sentiments around social equity), public officials may find it increasingly challenging to commit to actual goals. The best data that may be public could be statements from agency leadership or announcements of significant awards. Those are imperfect predictors of implementation. Also the lack of a mechanism that can account for overspending, as well. That is important because while it seems that progress will be a function of public policy actions, one needs to worry about any actions that undermine the credibility of the overall effort for redress. Given those constraints, one might turn to past successes of any initiatives of that nature: a good analogy might help assess the pace of disbursement. Given the government history of allocating funds related to redressing past government action, in the present one might observe the success in implementing grants to African Americans who are descendants from Slaves. The other good way might be historical examples of funding programs on reparations - the results on the outcomes of initiatives might give valuable insights: past reparations programs around slavery and similar issues would also be another useful set of examples because they too can give hints on if we can estimate the possible amount of progress in next couple of months. Because even though such programs generally involve different specific circumstances some features are generally similar which will make analogies even a bit reliable. While historical analogies are risky predictors, the programs from the previous century around African American descendant of ex slaves and even the Australian native peoples in the aboriginal community - those did generally show us that significant money was necessary to fix up the conditions of disadvantaged group and these were expensive efforts that still were well-justified. All the factors being considered: (1) the specifics about the particular program still lacking, and (2) the likelihood of historical examples being representative of success or failure - as much as a well-founded probability estimate we can possibly derive, at this juncture and given past programs that seem to involve addressing past harm, are those that in the process might be worth looking closely, one might anticipate with some hesitation that: the probability being between 15% - 20%, However this also depends largely on the assumptions that any kind of large-scale remediation efforts do not often achieve their lofty goals. Given the analysis, at the moment this is based upon, that would reflect uncertainty and possibly the limitations to achieving success in getting many minority artists to claim those grants on time with an estimated lower bound because some of those programs involved addressing historical events that go beyond the issues of addressing minority artists."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "248e601a-f02d-45ec-96bc-41cf19bc42ca", "title": "Will 23,000 or fewer minority artists receive federal grants for past discrimination by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by August 31, 2024, 23,000 or fewer minority artists have been confirmed to receive federal grants as part of a program addressing past discrimination, or if the information cannot be reliably verified.

However, if the economy is experiencing a downturn, a rate cut might be more likely to boost economic growth. 2. Monetary policy framework: The Central Bank of Indonesia has a clear inflation-targeting framework, which implies that it prioritizes maintaining price stability over economic growth. However, it also has a flexible framework that allows for adjustments to the monetary policy stance based on economic conditions. 3. Past decisions: The Central Bank has cut interest rates in the past when the economy was weak. This suggests that they are willing to use monetary policy to support economic growth. 4.

According to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Brazil's monthly job growth has been steadily increasing since 2020, with some fluctuations. However, the growth has been mostly above 50,000, with a few exceptions. To better understand the likelihood of job growth falling below 50,000, we can look at the unemployment rate, which has been trending downward in recent years. A low unemployment rate is often associated with strong labor market conditions, which can lead to higher job growth. Another factor to consider is the economic growth rate, which has been sluggish in Brazil in recent years. A slow economy can lead to reduced job growth, but it's uncertain whether this will be sufficient to push job growth below 50,000.

The Central Bank of South Korea has been actively managing the interest rate to balance economic growth and inflation. If the economy is growing steadily and inflation remains under control, the bank might maintain or even lower the interest rate to stimulate further growth. However, if the economy shows signs of slowing down or inflation starts to rise, the bank might raise the interest rate to curb inflation and maintain economic stability. I'll consider the current economic indicators, such as GDP growth rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate, to gauge the likelihood of the bank lowering the interest rate.

A public transit-only policy would align with these goals, as it would reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, decreasing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. 3. Previous policies and initiatives: The city has implemented various transportation-focused initiatives, such as expanding public transit options and promoting ride-sharing services. This suggests a willingness to invest in transportation infrastructure and promote alternative modes of transportation. 4. Potential challenges and exceptions: While a public transit-only policy would be beneficial, it might also pose logistical challenges, such as ensuring adequate public transportation capacity, managing crowds, and accommodating visitors with disabilities. The policy may need to allow for exceptions, such as emergency services or VIP access. 5. Announcement timing: The announcement must be made by August 31, 2024.

First, we should look at the current situation on the ground in Yemen. The cholera outbreak has been ongoing for several years, and it's one of the worst in recent history. The WHO has been actively involved in responding to the outbreak, providing funding, technical assistance, and coordinating humanitarian efforts. However, despite these efforts, the outbreak remains a significant public health concern. Next, we should consider the WHO's declaration process for global emergencies. The WHO declares a global emergency when a public health risk has the potential to require a coordinated international response. The declaration is usually made in response to a sudden increase in cases or a significant deterioration in the situation. If the situation in Yemen improves significantly, the WHO might reconsider its emergency declaration. Another factor to consider is the WHO's communication strategy. The organization typically makes public announcements through various channels, including press releases, social media, and official statements. If the WHO were to declare the cholera outbreak no longer a global emergency, it's likely that this announcement would be made through these channels and reported by major international news outlets. However, there are also reasons why the WHO might not declare the outbreak no longer a global emergency by August 2024. The situation in Yemen is complex, with ongoing conflict, displacement, and infrastructure challenges that could hinder the control of the outbreak.

Regional militant groups in the Black Sea region are relatively small and not as well-funded as those in other regions, which might reduce the likelihood of a successful attack on a tanker. Additionally, the Black Sea has a relatively low volume of tanker traffic compared to other major shipping lanes, which could also contribute to a lower risk of an oil spill.

The question will resolve as YES if the performance is not officially confirmed, Ros\u00e9 does not perform individually, the event does not take place in Central Park, or the performance is not reported by at least two reputable news sources. Given the information available, I can make some educated guesses about the likelihood of each criterion being met. Firstly, it's unlikely that the performance will not be officially confirmed, as the Global Citizen Festival organizers would typically announce their lineup in advance. I assign a probability of 0.05 to this criterion. Secondly, while it's possible that Ros\u00e9 might not perform individually, it's more likely that she will perform as part of Blackpink or another group. I assign a probability of 0.3 to this criterion. Thirdly, the event is scheduled to take place in Central Park, New York City, so it's unlikely that the location will change. I assign a probability of 0.01 to this criterion. Lastly, reputable news sources typically report on high-profile events like the Global Citizen Festival, so it's unlikely that the performance will not be reported by at least two sources. I assign a probability of 0.1 to this criterion. To calculate the overall probability, I need to consider the probability of all these criteria being met. Assuming independence between the criteria, I can multiply their probabilities together. 0.05 * 0.3 * 0.01 * 0.1 = 0.000015. However, this is an extremely low probability, and it's unlikely that all these criteria will be met. A more realistic approach would be to consider the probability of at least one criterion being met. Since the question will resolve as YES if any of the criteria are met, I can use the complement rule to calculate the probability. 1 - (probability of all criteria not being met) = 1 - (0.95 * 0.7 * 0.99 * 0.9) = 1 - 0.59635 = 0.40365.

First, let's look at the current trends and policies related to short-term rentals in London. The city has already implemented measures to regulate short-term rentals, such as the 'London Boroughs' Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) and Selective Licensing' policy. This suggests that the city is actively considering regulations to manage short-term rentals. However, the question is about a specific announcement by July 2024. To assess the likelihood of such an announcement, we should consider the pace of policy-making in London and the current political climate. The UK government has been tightening regulations on short-term rentals, and London's local government may follow suit. Additionally, the city's mayor, Sadiq Khan, has been vocal about his support for stricter regulations on short-term rentals. On the other hand, there are also factors that could suggest a lower probability of such an announcement by July 2024. The policy-making process in London can be slow, and it's possible that any restrictions could be implemented later than July 2024. Furthermore, there may be opposition from certain groups, such as property owners or the tourism industry, which could slow down the implementation of new regulations. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of London announcing plans to restrict short-term rental units by July 2024 as follows: I believe that there is a moderate likelihood of such an announcement, as the city has shown a willingness to regulate short-term rentals in the past, and the current political climate suggests that stricter regulations are being considered.

Global economic factors: The global economy is expected to experience a slowdown in 2024, which could negatively impact the Taiwanese market. The US-China trade tensions, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the potential for a recession in the US could all contribute to a decline in the index. 3.

Listeria outbreaks are unpredictable: Even with robust quality control measures, listeria outbreaks can occur due to unforeseen circumstances, such as supplier contamination or equipment failure. 2. Regulatory scrutiny: The FDA and USDA may conduct more frequent inspections or audits in response to recent food safety concerns, increasing the likelihood of detecting a listeria contamination.

As of my knowledge cutoff, Jens Weidmann was born in 1958, which makes him 65 years old in 2023. While this is not a definitive indicator of retirement, it is worth noting that many central bank governors retire around their mid-to-late 60s. Additionally, Jens Weidmann has been a vocal critic of certain European Central Bank policies, which might lead to his departure if his views become too divergent from the ECB's stance. However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that he will be removed from his position due to policy disagreements.

Firstly, the probability of Russian drone and missile attacks on Poland is difficult to estimate, as it depends on various geopolitical factors, including the current state of relations between Russia and Poland, the presence of Russian forces near the Polish border, and the level of military activity in the region. However, given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the potential for escalation, it is reasonable to assume that there is a non-zero probability of such attacks occurring. Secondly, the probability of fatalities exceeding 10 in a single month is related to the intensity and frequency of the attacks. If the attacks are sporadic and involve a small number of missiles or drones, the likelihood of fatalities exceeding 10 is low. However, if the attacks are more frequent and intense, the likelihood of fatalities exceeding 10 increases. Given the current geopolitical situation, it is reasonable to assume that the intensity and frequency of Russian drone and missile attacks on Poland will be relatively low, at least in the short term. Therefore, the probability of fatalities exceeding 10 in a single month is also low. However, it's also worth noting that the question specifies that the reports must not come from Polish government statements or be reported by at least two major international news outlets. This means that even if there are fatalities exceeding 10 in a single month, they may not be immediately reported or confirmed by the required sources, which could affect the resolution of the question.

Firstly, the program's enrollment is likely to be influenced by various factors such as public awareness, marketing efforts, and the state's economic conditions. However, without specific data on these factors, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction. Historically, Medicaid expansion programs in other states have seen varying levels of enrollment, but there is no clear pattern or trend that suggests a specific enrollment cap. Moreover, the enrollment count only includes newly covered individuals, excluding those who were previously eligible for Medicaid. Given the lack of specific data on the program's marketing efforts and public awareness, I'll rely on general trends in Medicaid expansion programs. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the average monthly enrollment rate for Medicaid expansion programs in 2020 was around 5-7% of the eligible population. However, this rate can vary significantly depending on the state and the specific program. Considering these factors, I'll make a rough estimate of the probability based on the assumption that Missouri's Medicaid expansion program will follow a similar enrollment trend. Assuming an average enrollment rate of 5-7% of the eligible population, and considering the state's population size and demographic characteristics, I estimate the total enrollment to be around 200,000 to 300,000 individuals.

The current landscape suggests that any attempts to reinstate the rule will face significant opposition.

This suggests that the company has a strong financial backing and may have access to additional funding sources. 2. Government incentives for electric vehicles: The U.S. government has been actively promoting the adoption of electric vehicles through various initiatives, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure and other related projects. It's possible that Lucid Motors could benefit from these initiatives. 3. Lucid Motors' electric vehicle production plans: The company has plans to expand its production capacity and has announced partnerships with companies like Volkswagen to develop new electric vehicles. This suggests that Lucid Motors is committed to electric vehicle production and may be eligible for government grants related to these initiatives. 4. Government grants for electric vehicle manufacturers: In the past, the U.S. government has awarded grants to companies like Tesla and Rivian for electric vehicle-related projects. This suggests that the government is willing to provide funding for electric vehicle initiatives. However, there are also some factors that could affect the likelihood of Lucid Motors receiving over $500 million in grants: 1. Competition for funding: The U.S. government has limited funding available for grants, and other companies in the electric vehicle industry, such as Tesla and Rivian, may also be competing for these funds. 2. Stringent grant application and approval process: The grant application and approval process can be complex and time-consuming, and it's possible that Lucid Motors may not meet the necessary criteria or may face delays in the application process. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Lucid Motors receiving over $500 million in grants for electric vehicle initiatives by July 2024 is around 60%.

His policies have been met with both support and criticism, but the government may prefer stability in leadership during these challenging times. 3. Precedent: Historically, governors of the Bank of Japan have served multiple terms, and there is no strong precedent for abrupt changes unless there are significant policy shifts or political pressures. 4.

Additionally, I will consider the central bank's recent decisions and communication around interest rates. In Q1 2023, Bank Negara Malaysia, the central bank, began a rate-hiking cycle, but it also explicitly mentioned that the hikes will be 'data-dependent', indicating that it will pause if inflation is tamed and economic growth stabilises. The interest rate will also depend on other Central Bank actions and regional, and global factors that affects Central Banks actions, thus we will have to weigh those probabilities. The overall interest rate hike environment started to turn, especially among Asian Central Banks that stopped the cycle, we therefore, would need to make some probabilistic calculations: If Bank Negara wants to adjust interest rates soon, and we estimate with a probability of 6% (very unlikely and small, because, though interest rates were on increasing mode for 6 rounds), we need to understand what probability it is they might have done a turnaround to 0%, meaning interest rates will fall because we see inflationary risk subsiding and that means it has 70.8% chance. Probability is estimated with some mathematical operations as the chance. But also there's going to be an estimation (10% of) and it may also indicate of probability, because central banker decisions depend on several market indicators that have no control of it. In some instances the Central Bank is to cut interest rates because, inflation has been decreasing at a faster rate than predicted. Therefore, it might reduce interest rates.

As of my last update, global economic concerns, including those related to inflation and recessions in major economies, have increased the likelihood that central banks, including those in regions like Southeast Asia, will maintain or adopt a wait-and-see approach for monetary policy actions. Specifically, the context of higher interest rates imposed by banks in response to inflation risks and the reluctance to hike rates further before assessing incoming data suggest central banks often prefer to await clearer information before making big policy announcements. However, the behavior of the Bank Negara Malaysia (the Central Bank of Malaysia) can't be generalized or predicted through broad economic data alone. Given the data available is limited to macroeconomic outlooks and announcements from such central banks (which inherently are subject to change upon new information arrival), considering the general hesitance of central banks to adopt drastic measures including interest rates cuts without considerable economic stimuli, the default assumption under such uncertainty appears to lead towards a decrease in odds of an unexpected interest rates cut announcement during the coming months. While this central bank's tendency to move in line with global responses to economic stability is probable, the current data sets do not fully support drawing a definitive position on rate cut announcements during the evaluation period. Taking into consideration the uncertainty present in determining the exact financial decisions likely to be announced by monetary policy committees given the various factors at hand, particularly the general environment of an economic downturn along with cautionary monetary management, which is likely indicative of current central bank practice, though not a determinant of potential future actions directly, our reasoning leads towards a smaller probability of central banks such as the Malaysian one electing to unexpectedly cut its interest rates soon."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.46327529229426734, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.23163764614713367, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 1.0436010302570822, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

One factor to consider is the Cartel del Golfo's history of resilience and ability to adapt to challenges and operations against them by Mexican authorities. This adaptability and resilience may limit the likelihood of a declaration being made, as mere disruptions in their activities would not suffice for such an official announcement. Another important consideration is the current and ongoing operations against the cartel. Effective and significant efforts against organized crime often yield more modest and incremental outcomes. Hence, the potential for making a declaration would require tangible and substantial advancements that impact the cartel's ability to function as a cohesive and effective entity. In recent years, efforts against Mexican cartels have involved an array of measures including targeting leadership, cutting supply chains, and utilizing law enforcement resources. Despite these efforts, the trajectory and depth of these successes might vary, and without direct insight into the nature of operations against the Cartel del Golfo in this context, it is difficult to assess the exact impact or likelihood of the cartel being dismantled enough to merit an official declaration by Mexican authorities. Taking into account these considerations and without having access to up-to-date information on recent and current operations against the Cartel del Golfo, we can infer a cautious assessment. The fact that merely arresting individual members or temporarily disrupting their operations is insufficient for a positive resolution underscores the need for substantial evidence of the cartel's complete dismantling. However, the question explicitly asks about the probability of a public declaration by the authorities themselves, which inherently implies the existence of at least two reputable news sources to cover such an announcement. Thus, the possibility exists, albeit with substantial skepticism based on the complexity and past resilience of cartels, that such an announcement might be made given sufficient information and evidence, though likely under specific, more successful circumstances.

Google's history of labor relations: Google has faced labor disputes in the past, but they have generally been resolved through negotiations without major disruptions. This suggests that the company may be willing to work with its employees to avoid a prolonged strike. 2. The current labor market: The tech industry is experiencing a period of high demand for skilled workers, which could give employees more bargaining power.

However, this lack of information doesn't necessarily imply that there won't be any attempts in the future. 4. Timing and resolution date: The question specifies that the law must be enacted by July 31, 2024, which gives the legislature a relatively short timeframe to pass a new law. This could be a challenge, especially if the issue is contentious or if the legislature is preoccupied with other matters. 5. News coverage and legislative records: To confirm the enactment of a new law, there must be official state legislative records and reports from at least two major news outlets. This suggests that the question is not just about the passage of a law but also about its visibility and recognition in the public sphere. Considering these factors, I believe that the probability of South Carolina enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024 is relatively low. While it's possible that the legislature could pass such a law, especially if there is strong advocacy and public support, the current legislative environment and the short timeframe for enactment suggest that this outcome is less likely."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "18b4b5fa-5f2c-46ce-be2f-cd7807154d08", "title": "Will South Carolina not enact a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the state of South Carolina does not enact a new law that modifies or replaces the current restrictions on medical care for transgender youth.

However, if these restrictions are already in place and have not been recently modified, it may be less likely that a new law would be enacted to modify them. 3.

Therefore, it's unclear whether the donation was made and whether it was used to cover full tuition for all medical students. However, we can make an educated guess based on the historical context. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has a history of making significant donations to educational institutions, including Harvard University. In 2020, the foundation donated $100 million to the University of Chicago to help cover tuition for low-income students. While this donation was not specifically for Harvard University, it shows the foundation's commitment to supporting education and reducing financial barriers for students. Another factor to consider is that Harvard University has a long history of being one of the most expensive private universities in the United States. The university's tuition fees are significantly higher than those of public universities, and many students rely on financial aid to attend. If the Gates Foundation were to make a significant donation to cover full tuition for all Harvard medical students, it would be a major news story and would likely be publicly announced by the university.

This suggests that there is a possibility, although not a certainty, that the donation might not cover full tuition for all medical students due to various factors such as conditions attached to the donation or the specific criteria for eligibility."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.18402096936348733, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.09201048468174367, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6316664418548652, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Previous attempts: I couldn't find any information on previous attempts by Missouri to conduct a referendum on abortion rights. This lack of precedent makes it difficult to assess the likelihood of such an event occurring. 3.

Firstly, Missouri has been a conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature, which has led to restrictive abortion laws. However, there haven't been any recent announcements or plans for a public referendum specifically focused on enshrining protection for abortion rights in the state. Given the conservative leanings of the state, it's possible that any potential referendum on abortion rights might be more focused on restricting access to abortion rather than protecting it. However, there are no publicly available sources indicating that a referendum on abortion rights protection is being planned or conducted by the state of Missouri by August 2024.
