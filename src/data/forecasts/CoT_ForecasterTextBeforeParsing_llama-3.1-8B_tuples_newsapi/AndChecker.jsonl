The likelihood of a listeria outbreak in deli meats: Listeria is a common contaminant in deli meats, and outbreaks have occurred in the past. Given the recent trends in food safety, it is plausible that an outbreak could occur in the next few months. 2. The likelihood of an official recall: If an outbreak occurs, it is likely that the affected companies will issue a recall. The companies will be pressured by regulatory agencies, public health officials, and the media to take action. 3. The likelihood of both companies issuing a recall: While it is possible that both companies could issue a recall, it is also possible that only one company will be affected. 4. The time frame: The question specifies that the recall must occur by August 31, 2024. This means that the companies have about 2.5 months to issue a recall after the outbreak occurs. 5.

The reports or warnings must specifically mention the AI assistant and its role in spreading election misinformation. If no such reports or warnings are issued by the resolution date, this condition is not met. (b) By July 31, 2024, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the UK officially announces the completion of its investigation into digital advertising practices involving at least five major companies. Completion must be confirmed through an official CMA announcement or reported by at least two major news outlets (such as Reuters, Associated Press, Wall Street Journal, or New York Times).

For condition (a), Google's AI assistant spreading election misinformation, I consider the following factors: 1. Google's AI assistant has been shown to be capable of spreading misinformation in the past, particularly through its response to user queries. This suggests that there is a risk of it spreading misinformation in the future. 2. The upcoming US presidential election in 2024 is a high-stakes event that is likely to attract significant attention and scrutiny, which may lead to increased monitoring of AI assistants for potential misinformation. 3. However, Google has implemented various measures to mitigate the spread of misinformation, such as fact-checking partnerships and improvements to its search algorithm. These efforts may reduce the likelihood of its AI assistant spreading misinformation. 4. The condition requires credible reports or warnings from at least two of the specified sources, which implies that there needs to be a significant and widespread issue with the AI assistant for this condition to be met. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of condition (a) occurring as 0.35. For condition (b), the CMA announcing the completion of its investigation into digital advertising practices, I consider the following factors: 1. The CMA has been actively investigating digital advertising practices in the past, and it is likely that they will continue to do so in the future. 2. The investigation involves at least five major companies, which increases the likelihood of significant findings and a formal announcement of completion. 3. The condition requires an official announcement from the CMA or reporting by at least two major news outlets, which suggests that there needs to be a notable development in the investigation for this condition to be met. 4. The investigation is ongoing, and the CMA has not provided a specific timeline for its completion. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of condition (b) occurring as 0.55. This is a higher probability than condition (a), as the CMA's investigation is ongoing, and there is a precedent for them to issue formal announcements on significant findings. Combining these probabilities, I estimate the probability that both conditions will occur as the product of their individual probabilities: 0.35 * 0.55 = 0.1925."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0031946000073595493, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0010648666691198498, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07975772784431716, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Component (a) involves the company announcing and implementing a new scheduling system. This is a relatively complex task that requires significant resources and effort. However, Union Pacific has faced issues with schedule predictability in the past, and implementing a new system could be a strategic move to improve operations and reduce costs. The company has a history of investing in technology and process improvements, which suggests that they may be capable of implementing a new scheduling system. Component (b) involves negotiating a new agreement with the conductors' union. This is a more challenging task, as it requires finding a mutually acceptable solution that addresses the union's concerns about schedule predictability. The union has been vocal about its demands for more predictable schedules, and any agreement would need to address these concerns. However, the union and Union Pacific have a history of negotiating agreements, and it's possible that they could reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of Union Pacific implementing a new scheduling system as around 0.6 (60%). This is a relatively high probability, as the company has the resources and capabilities to implement a new system. However, there are still risks and uncertainties involved, such as the complexity of the task and the potential for delays or setbacks. The probability of the union and Union Pacific reaching a new agreement addressing work schedule predictability is lower, around 0.4 (40%). This is because negotiating an agreement with the union is a more challenging task, and there are risks of disagreements and delays. However, the union and Union Pacific have a history of negotiating agreements, and it's possible that they could reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Taking these probabilities into account, I estimate the overall probability of Union Pacific both implementing a new scheduling system and reaching a new agreement with the conductors' union addressing work schedule predictability by August 2024 as around 0.24 (24%). This is a relatively low probability, as it requires both components (a) and (b) to occur.

On the other hand, Medicaid expansion and plan design are complex issues that often involve political and bureaucratic hurdles, which could slow down or prevent other states from adopting such a plan. To further inform my estimate, I'll consider the current state of Medicaid expansion and plan design in the U.S. As of 2022, 39 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but some of these states have not adopted community engagement requirements.

Historical context: Pennsylvania has a history of conducting referendums on social issues, but they are relatively rare. The state has a Democratic-controlled legislature, which might be less likely to support a referendum on abortion rights, as it could be seen as a conservative or Republican-led initiative. 2. Current political climate: The US Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) has led to a surge in state-level abortion restrictions. However, this has also sparked a counter-movement to enshrine abortion rights in state constitutions. Pennsylvania's Democratic Governor, Josh Shapiro, has expressed support for abortion rights, which could indicate a willingness to consider a referendum. 3. Referendum process: In Pennsylvania, referendums are typically initiated by the General Assembly, which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate. This makes it a challenging process, especially given the current partisan divide. 4. Public support: While there is a strong public interest in abortion rights, there is also a significant divide on the issue. A referendum might be seen as a way to mobilize public opinion, but it's uncertain whether the state would prioritize this over other pressing issues. 5.

However, this proposition did not specifically address abortion rights, but rather reproductive freedom more broadly. Given this context, it's possible that California might hold a referendum on abortion rights in the future, but it's uncertain whether it will happen by July 2024. Regarding Tennessee, there is no clear indication of the state's plans to hold a referendum on healthcare access. Tennessee has a conservative government and has been involved in various legal battles related to reproductive rights and healthcare access. However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that a referendum on healthcare access will be held by July 2024. Considering these factors, the probability of California holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024 is around 0.6 (60%). This is based on the state's history of holding referendums on social issues, but also taking into account the specific context of the current question. The probability of Tennessee holding a referendum on healthcare access by July 2024 is around 0.2 (20%). This is based on the state's conservative government and lack of clear indications of plans to hold such a referendum. To calculate the probability of both events occurring, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event. Therefore, the probability of both California holding a referendum on abortion rights and Tennessee holding a referendum on healthcare access by July 2024 is around 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12 (12%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

While some AI chatbots have been known to spread misinformation, many platforms, including X, have implemented measures to mitigate this issue. However, the effectiveness of these measures can be limited, and the complexity of AI-generated content can make it challenging to detect and address misinformation. Secondly, I'll consider the specific context of X's platform and its history of handling misinformation.

The platform's efforts to promote transparency and fact-checking might reduce the likelihood of Grok spreading misinformation. Thirdly, I'll examine the potential impact of Grok's design and functionality on the spread of misinformation.

Secondly, the job market for AI professionals is highly competitive, and companies are often looking for ways to attract and retain top talent. Announcing plans to increase its AI-related workforce could be a way for Adobe to signal its commitment to AI and attract more talent in the field. However, there are also potential reasons why Adobe might not make such an announcement. For example, the company might be planning to increase its AI-related workforce, but not to the extent that it would make a public announcement about it. Alternatively, Adobe might be focused on other areas of its business and not see AI-related workforce growth as a priority.

The U.S. government has been actively promoting electric vehicle adoption through various initiatives, including grants for projects related to EV manufacturing, assembly, or related projects. California, being a leader in EV adoption, is likely to receive significant funding for such projects. However, the exact amount of funding is uncertain. Given the federal government's commitment to EV adoption and California's role in it, I assign a moderate probability to this condition being met. Condition 2: Adobe announcing plans to increase its AI-related workforce. Adobe has been investing heavily in AI research and development, and it's plausible that they would announce plans to increase their AI-related workforce. However, the company's hiring plans are not always publicly disclosed, and the announcement might be made through official channels or reported by major news outlets.

State Politics and Education Policy: South Carolina has historically been a conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature. While there have been efforts to increase access to education, the state has not been at the forefront of progressive education policy. However, there have been some recent initiatives to expand access to higher education, such as the 'ReadySC' program, which aims to provide workforce training and education opportunities for in-demand fields. This suggests a willingness to invest in education, but it's unclear if this will extend to a comprehensive free community college plan. 2. Previous Attempts and Similar Initiatives: There have been several attempts to implement free community college programs in South Carolina, but none have been successful. In 2019, a proposal for a free community college program was introduced, but it stalled in the legislature. This lack of success might indicate that implementing a free community college plan is not a priority for the state's politicians. 3. Current Legislative Landscape: The current legislative landscape in South Carolina is complex. While there is a Republican-controlled legislature, there are also some Democratic lawmakers who have expressed support for expanding access to education. However, the party in control and the political climate can shift, and it's difficult to predict future legislative actions with certainty. 4. Economic Factors: South Carolina's economy is heavily reliant on manufacturing, tourism, and international trade. The state's workforce development needs are significant, and a free community college plan could potentially address some of these needs by providing training in in-demand fields. However, the economic benefits of such a plan are not guaranteed, and the state might not see the value in investing in it. 5. Public Support and Advocacy: There is a growing movement in the United States to make community college free, with several states implementing or proposing similar plans. However, public opinion in South Carolina might not be strongly in favor of such a plan, which could impact its likelihood of implementation. Considering these factors, while there are some positive signs, such as the 'ReadySC' program, the lack of success of previous attempts and the conservative leaning of the state's politics suggest that implementing a free community college plan by July 2024 is unlikely."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "d50435a9-865e-4135-8208-42645818495a", "title": "Will both of the following occur by July 2024: (a) Stanford University fully covers tuition for undergraduate students from lower-income families, and (b) South Carolina implements a free community college plan?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following conditions are met by July 31, 2024:\n\n(a) Stanford University officially implements a policy to fully cover tuition for undergraduate students from families earning less than $100,000 annually.

Large companies often undergo multiple rounds of restructuring as they adapt to changing market conditions, technological advancements, and shifting business priorities.

Google, as a leading tech company, might need to make further adjustments to its workforce to stay ahead. Another factor is the current economic climate. The global economy is experiencing a downturn, and tech companies, including Google, might need to reduce costs further to maintain profitability. This could lead to additional layoffs. Additionally, there have been previous instances of companies announcing more significant layoffs than initially planned. For example, in 2022, Amazon announced a 10% reduction in its workforce, following an initial 18,000 job cuts.

However, the index has also experienced significant volatility, with sharp declines in response to global economic downturns and domestic political uncertainty. Looking at historical data, the KOSPI index has reached or exceeded 3,500 points several times in the past, but these instances have been relatively short-lived.

Firstly, the Central Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has been monitoring inflation closely, and there have been concerns about the country's economic growth. Given the global economic uncertainty and the RBNZ's past actions, it's plausible that they might announce a new economic stimulus package to support the economy. However, the RBNZ has been cautious in its monetary policy decisions, and it's uncertain whether they will take bold action in the near future.

BYD is a leading Chinese electric vehicle and battery manufacturer, and its financials are closely tied to the global demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy. Historically, BYD has experienced significant growth in its electric vehicle sales, driven by increasing demand for environmentally friendly transportation and government incentives for electric vehicle adoption. However, the company also faces intense competition in the global electric vehicle market, and its financial performance can be impacted by factors such as supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, and shifts in consumer preferences. Looking ahead to 2024, I anticipate that BYD will continue to face challenges in the global market, including increasing competition from established automakers and new entrants, as well as potential disruptions in the global supply chain. Additionally, the company's financial performance may be impacted by the ongoing trade tensions between China and the US, which could affect its ability to export electric vehicles and components. Despite these challenges, BYD has a strong track record of innovation and has been investing heavily in research and development to improve its product offerings and manufacturing efficiency. The company has also expanded its presence in the global market, including in Europe and the US, which could help it to mitigate the impact of any potential disruptions in the Chinese market. Given these factors, I estimate that there is a moderate likelihood that BYD's quarterly net income will increase by over 20% year-over-year by July 2024.

Condition 1: The U.S. government resumes consideration of liquefied natural gas export projects. The likelihood of this happening depends on various factors, including government policies, market trends, and geopolitical events. Assuming that the current administration or a future one will review LNG export projects, the probability of this happening within the given timeframe is relatively high, around 70-80%. This is because the U.S. has been actively promoting its LNG exports, and government agencies have been reviewing applications. Condition 2: BYD's quarterly net income increases by over 20% year-over-year. BYD's financial performance is influenced by market demand, competition, and technological advancements. The electric vehicle (EV) and battery markets have been rapidly growing, which should support BYD's financial growth. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fluctuations can impact the company's performance. Assuming a moderate growth rate, I estimate the probability of a 20% year-over-year increase in net income for any quarter by July 2024 to be around 60-70%. Combining these probabilities, I estimate the probability that both conditions will be met by July 2024 to be around 42-56%.

Firstly, the Nipah virus is a zoonotic disease, primarily affecting animals but with the potential to transmit to humans, and its outbreaks have been reported in various regions, including Asia. Given the global nature of the outbreak, it's essential to monitor the situation closely. Typically, the WHO declares an outbreak over when the number of cases decreases significantly and the risk of transmission is deemed low. However, the exact timeline for declaring an outbreak over can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances, such as the virus's severity, the effectiveness of containment measures, and the availability of vaccines or treatments.\n\nTo assess the likelihood of the WHO declaring the outbreak over by August 2024, I'll consider the following points:\n\n1. Current situation: The question doesn't provide information on the current status of the outbreak, such as the number of new cases, the number of affected countries, or the effectiveness of public health measures in place. However, given the question's resolution date is in August 2024, it's reasonable to assume that the outbreak has been ongoing for some time and that efforts to contain it have been in place.\n\n2. Typical duration of outbreaks: The duration of outbreaks varies widely depending on the virus and the effectiveness of public health responses. For some outbreaks, especially those caused by highly contagious viruses, it might take several months or even years to bring under control. However, for others, especially those caused by less contagious viruses or those where a vaccine or effective treatment is available, the timeline might be shorter.\n\n3. WHO's declaration criteria: The WHO has a set of criteria for declaring an outbreak over. These criteria typically include a significant decrease in the number of cases, a reduction in the number of countries affected, and a decrease in the severity of the outbreak. However, the exact details of these criteria are not provided in the question.\n\n4. Global health responses: The question mentions that public health responses have been heightened globally. This suggests that international cooperation and efforts to contain the outbreak are in place, which could potentially accelerate the process of declaring the outbreak over.\n\n5. Availability of information: The question relies on official WHO announcements or reports from reputable news sources for confirmation. This suggests that information on the status of the outbreak and any potential declaration by the WHO will be publicly available.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's challenging to estimate a precise probability without more specific information about the current situation, the effectiveness of containment measures, and the WHO's criteria for declaring the outbreak over.

India's inflation rate has been influenced by several factors including global commodity prices, domestic economic growth, and monetary policy decisions. Historically, India's inflation rate has experienced fluctuations due to these factors, with periods of high inflation often occurring when global commodity prices rise or domestic economic growth accelerates. Looking at recent trends, India's inflation rate has been trending upwards, driven by factors such as rising global commodity prices and a strong domestic economy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central bank, has been closely monitoring inflation and has taken steps to control it through monetary policy decisions. However, the RBI's efforts may not be enough to prevent a significant increase in inflation, especially if global commodity prices continue to rise. Given these factors, it's reasonable to expect that India's inflation rate may continue to rise in the coming months, although the extent of the increase is uncertain.

However, Mexico's economy has historically been resilient to global economic downturns, with a diverse export base and a relatively stable financial system. Next, I'll consider domestic factors. Mexico's government has implemented policies aimed at stimulating economic growth, such as investments in infrastructure and social programs. Additionally, the country's manufacturing sector, which accounts for a significant portion of its economy, has been performing well, driven by the North American Free Trade Agreement (USMCA). However, there are also potential risks to consider. The ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a surge in global food and energy prices, which could negatively impact Mexico's economy. Furthermore, the country's high inflation rate and a significant current account deficit could also pose challenges to economic growth.

First, let's consider the Mexican economy. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. To estimate the probability of the Mexican economy avoiding a recession, I'll look at the country's recent economic performance and any potential risks or challenges. Mexico's economy has been growing steadily, but it's also vulnerable to external shocks, such as changes in global trade policies or economic downturns in the US. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico, the country's GDP growth rate has been around 2-3% in recent years. While this growth rate is relatively low, it's not indicative of a recession. However, there are some risks on the horizon, such as the ongoing trade tensions between the US and Mexico, which could potentially impact the country's economy. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of the Mexican economy avoiding a recession as around 60-70%. This is a relatively high probability, as the country's economy has been growing steadily and there are no clear signs of a recession on the horizon. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Sony Corporation resolving a major workers' strike. A strike involving at least 1,000 participants and lasting for at least one week would require significant coordination and resources from both the company and the union. While strikes are not uncommon in the manufacturing sector, a major strike at Sony Corporation would be a significant event. To estimate the probability of such an event occurring, I'll look at the company's recent labor relations and any potential tensions between management and workers. Sony Corporation has a history of labor disputes, but it's also a large and well-established company with a strong track record of resolving disputes through negotiations. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Sony Corporation resolving a major workers' strike as around 40-50%. This is a relatively low probability, as a major strike would require significant tensions and conflict between management and workers, which is not currently evident. Finally, to estimate the probability that both conditions will be met by July 2024, I'll multiply the probabilities of each condition occurring. This gives us a probability of around 24-35% (0.6 x 0.4)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Astellas may be hesitant to relinquish its patent rights, especially if the drug is still generating substantial revenue. However, there are also factors that could lead to a decision in favor of generic production.

Given the information provided, it's unclear what specific factors are at play in this scenario. Without access to confidential company data or insider information, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction. However, I can consider the general trends and practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Typically, pharmaceutical companies tend to enforce their patent rights to maintain market control and revenue. However, there are instances where companies voluntarily license their patents or withdraw them to allow generic production.

For the first condition, I'll look at historical trends and market forecasts. The S&P 500 has shown a steady growth pattern over the past few years, with some fluctuations. Given the current economic environment and market conditions, I'll consider the possibility of the index reaching 4,800 points by August 2024.

The COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing global economic challenges have created a high demand for IMF assistance, which could lead to a significant increase in funding commitments.

La Familia Michoacana is a notorious cartel known for its brutal tactics and widespread influence in Mexico. However, in recent years, the cartel has experienced a decline in power and influence due to a combination of law enforcement efforts, internal conflicts, and the rise of other cartels. While it is difficult to predict the exact actions of the Mexican government, it is possible that authorities may make a public declaration about the dismantling of the cartel if they have made significant progress in disrupting its operations and leadership structure. However, such a declaration would require a thorough evaluation of the cartel's current status and a clear indication of its ability to function as a cohesive criminal entity. Given these considerations, I believe that the probability of Mexican authorities making an official public declaration stating that the La Familia Michoacana drug cartel has been dismantled or effectively neutralized by July 2024 is relatively low. This is because the cartel's decline has been gradual, and it is likely that some remnants of the organization will continue to exist and operate in some form. Additionally, the Mexican government's efforts to combat organized crime are often hindered by corruption, violence, and limited resources. However, I also consider the possibility that the Mexican government may make a strategic decision to declare the cartel dismantled in order to boost public confidence, secure international cooperation, or justify future efforts to address the cartel's remnants.

Next, let's consider the likelihood of the United Food and Commercial Workers endorsing a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election. The UFCW is a powerful labor union with a significant presence in the US. While there is no clear pattern of the UFCW endorsing presidential candidates, they have made endorsements in past elections. The UFCW's endorsement process typically involves a thorough evaluation of the candidates' positions on labor issues, and they may consider factors such as the candidate's stance on workers' rights, trade policies, and social justice. Given the UFCW's history of making endorsements and their focus on labor issues, it is likely that they will endorse a candidate in the 2024 election. However, without knowing the specific candidates and their positions, it is difficult to assign a high probability to this event. I assign a probability of 0.7 to this event occurring by July 2024. Since the two events are independent, I will multiply their probabilities to estimate the probability that both events occur by July 2024.

Firstly, the demand for snack foods, including tortilla chips, has been relatively stable in the North American market in recent years. However, the demand for certain snack food categories, such as tortilla chips, can be influenced by factors like consumer preferences for healthier options, changing lifestyles, and economic conditions. Given that the question specifies a specific date (July 2024) and a certain increase in demand, I'll consider the general trend and outlook for the snack food industry. While it's uncertain whether PepsiCo will report an increase in demand for Tostitos specifically, I'll consider the company's overall performance and market position. PepsiCo, as a leading beverage and snack food company, has a strong brand portfolio and a significant presence in the North American market. The company has been investing in digital marketing, product innovation, and sustainability initiatives to drive growth. However, the demand for its snack foods, including Tostitos, may be impacted by various factors such as changing consumer preferences, competition from other brands, and economic conditions. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of PepsiCo reporting increased North American demand for its Tostitos brand by July 2024 is relatively low, but not negligible.

However, we can look at the overall trend of the snack food industry and PepsiCo's performance in the past. The demand for snack foods has been increasing due to the growth of the e-commerce market and changing consumer preferences. Additionally, PepsiCo has been investing in its Tostitos brand, introducing new products and flavors. While there is no guarantee of an increase in demand, the conditions seem favorable.

The current political climate in New Jersey: New Jersey has a Democratic governor and a Democratic-controlled state legislature, which suggests a more liberal stance on abortion rights. This increases the likelihood of a referendum on the topic. 2. The recent trend of state-level abortion legislation: In recent years, several states have considered or passed legislation related to abortion rights, including referendums in states like Kansas and Michigan. This suggests that there may be momentum for abortion rights referendums at the state level. 3. The potential for a referendum on abortion rights in New Jersey: There have been previous attempts to pass legislation related to abortion rights in New Jersey, including a 2020 bill that would have codified the right to abortion in the state constitution. However, it did not pass. A referendum on abortion rights could be a way to bypass legislative gridlock and put the issue directly to voters. 4. The likelihood of the New Jersey state government formally announcing a referendum: Given the current political climate and the trend of state-level abortion legislation, it is likely that the New Jersey state government would formally announce a referendum on abortion rights if it were to occur. However, there are also factors that could decrease the likelihood of a referendum, such as: 1. The complexity of the process: Holding a referendum requires significant administrative and logistical efforts, including drafting a ballot question, securing funding, and ensuring voter turnout. 2.

This suggests that the state is open to holding referendums on sensitive social issues. 2. Current political landscape: In 2022, California voters elected a new governor, Gavin Newsom, who has been a strong advocate for reproductive rights. The state legislature has also passed several bills aimed at protecting abortion access. This suggests that there is ongoing support for abortion rights in the state government. 3. National and international context: The US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 has created a highly polarized environment around abortion rights.

Historically, mortgage rates have been influenced by economic indicators such as inflation, employment rates, and monetary policy decisions by central banks. High inflation can lead to higher interest rates as a means to control inflation, while strong employment rates and economic growth can lead to higher interest rates as the economy approaches full capacity. Additionally, monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve, such as increasing the federal funds rate, can directly impact mortgage rates. Furthermore, global events such as geopolitical tensions, changes in commodity prices, and shifts in investor sentiment can also impact mortgage rates. Given these factors, I will consider the current economic conditions and recent trends to estimate the likelihood of mortgage rates exceeding 7.0% by August 2024. As of my knowledge cutoff, the current economic situation suggests a mixed outlook. The US economy has shown resilience in the face of global challenges, with low unemployment and steady GDP growth. However, inflation has been a concern, and the Federal Reserve has been gradually increasing the federal funds rate to control it. Additionally, there are ongoing global tensions, which can impact commodity prices and investor sentiment.

For condition (b), the E. coli outbreak tied to beef resulting in more than 10 confirmed deaths by August 2024, we can look at the historical context of foodborne illness outbreaks. E. coli outbreaks have occurred in the past, and while they are often linked to specific suppliers, the number of deaths can vary widely. According to the CDC, E. coli outbreaks in the US have resulted in anywhere from a few to several dozen deaths. Given the complexity of food production and distribution, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether an outbreak will occur or how severe it will be. However, considering the potential for contamination and the number of beef products consumed in the US, I would estimate the probability of condition (b) occurring as 0.3 (30%). Since these events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together to get the overall probability of both conditions occurring: 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21 (21%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.00014724526466527998, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 4.9081754888426664e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0174901099527963, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, let's consider the SEIU endorsement. The SEIU is a prominent labor union with a history of participating in national politics. While it's challenging to predict with certainty, the SEIU has traditionally endorsed candidates in presidential elections, often in alignment with the Democratic Party. Given the union's influence and the fact that presidential elections often attract high-profile endorsements, I would estimate a moderate to high probability of the SEIU endorsing a candidate in the 2024 election. However, the specific timing and the likelihood of endorsement for a particular candidate are harder to predict. Next, let's examine the implementation of a free community college plan in Washington. The concept of free community college has gained traction in various states, and Washington has been a hub for progressive policies. While there have been discussions and proposals for free community college in Washington, the likelihood of a comprehensive plan being implemented statewide by July 31, 2024, is uncertain. The process of implementing such a plan can be complex, involving legislative approval, budget allocation, and logistical planning. Given the complexity and the time required for such a plan to be implemented, I would estimate a lower probability for the plan to be in place by the resolution date.

Firstly, regarding the Bank of Korea's interest rate reduction, we should consider the current economic conditions in South Korea and the Bank's monetary policy stance. If the South Korean economy is experiencing a slowdown or facing economic challenges, the Bank of Korea might consider reducing its key interest rate to stimulate growth. However, this decision is also influenced by global economic trends and the Bank's inflation targets. Secondly, for the U.S. jobless claims exceeding 275,000 for two consecutive weeks, we need to consider the current state of the U.S. labor market.

Yes Bank has faced challenges in the past, including a major crisis in 2020 that led to a change in management and a significant injection of capital. Given this context, it's possible that the RBI may impose new curbs to ensure that Yes Bank is operating within safe limits. However, there are also reasons to be cautious. The RBI has already taken steps to strengthen the regulatory framework for banks in India, including the introduction of new guidelines for lending and risk management. These guidelines may already be having an impact on Yes Bank's lending practices, which could reduce the need for new curbs.

Historical trends: The FAO has consistently increased its funding commitments over the years, with a notable surge in recent years due to increased global attention to sustainable agriculture and food security. This trend suggests that the FAO is likely to continue announcing new funding commitments to support its goals. 2. Current global context: The world is facing significant challenges related to food security, climate change, and sustainable agriculture. The FAO has been actively engaged in promoting sustainable agriculture practices, reducing hunger and poverty, and improving food systems. Given the urgency of these issues, it is likely that the FAO will continue to announce new funding commitments to support these efforts. 3. Recent announcements: In the past year, the FAO has announced several significant funding commitments, including a $100 million initiative to support sustainable agriculture in Africa and a $50 million program to improve food security in Latin America. While these commitments are substantial, they are still below the $400 million threshold. 4. Potential sources of funding: The FAO has a diverse range of funding sources, including government contributions, private sector donations, and multilateral agencies. Given the current global economic landscape, it is possible that the FAO may receive new funding commitments from these sources to support its programs. However, there are also factors that could lead to a lower probability of the FAO announcing new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024. These include: 1. Uncertainty around funding sources: The FAO's funding commitments are often uncertain, and the organization may not have secured sufficient funding to meet its goals. 2. Prioritization of existing programs: The FAO may prioritize existing programs over new initiatives, which could limit the scope of new funding commitments. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the FAO announcing new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024 is relatively high, but not certain."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "fe0adb68-828f-415a-aca4-54af5ba9950c", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The Reserve Bank of India imposes new regulatory curbs on Yes Bank's lending by August 2024; and (b) The Food and Agriculture Organization announces new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES only if both of the following conditions are met: (a) By August 31, 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announces new regulatory curbs specifically targeting Yes Bank's lending practices.

For condition (a), the Reserve Bank of India imposing new regulatory curbs on Yes Bank's lending by August 2024, we can look at the RBI's past actions and the current state of Yes Bank. The RBI has a history of imposing regulatory curbs on banks that fail to meet certain standards. Yes Bank has faced challenges in the past, including a major scandal in 2020, which led to the resignation of its CEO and a significant decline in its stock price. Given this background, it's possible that the RBI may impose new curbs on Yes Bank's lending practices to ensure the bank's stability and compliance with regulatory requirements. However, the RBI is also known for its cautious approach to regulatory actions, and it typically provides warnings and guidance to banks before imposing new curbs. Therefore, the likelihood of the RBI imposing new curbs on Yes Bank's lending by August 2024 is moderate. For condition (b), the Food and Agriculture Organization announcing new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024, we can look at the FAO's past funding commitments and its current priorities. The FAO has a history of announcing significant funding commitments for initiatives related to food security, agriculture, and rural development. Given the FAO's focus on these areas, it's possible that it may announce new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024. However, the FAO's funding commitments are also subject to various factors, including donor funding, program priorities, and budget allocations. Therefore, the likelihood of the FAO announcing new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024 is also moderate. Combining these probabilities, we can estimate the likelihood of both conditions being met. Since the conditions are independent, we can multiply their probabilities.

Given the time-sensitive nature of the question, it is uncertain whether the New York state government will officially announce and conduct a referendum by August 31, 2024. Georgia has a more conservative political landscape, and while there have been efforts to restrict abortion access, there is no clear indication that a referendum on enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution is planned or announced. The verification requirement by at least two major news organizations adds an additional layer of uncertainty. Considering these factors, I assess the likelihood of both referendums taking place as follows: New York's referendum: 0.4 (40% chance) - There is a moderate chance that New York will hold a referendum, but it is uncertain whether it will meet the specified criteria. Georgia's referendum: 0.2 (20% chance) - Given Georgia's conservative politics, it is less likely that a referendum on enshrining abortion rights will be held.

For example, the US government's funding priorities may shift, or there may be delays in the approval process for grant applications. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability that Fisker will receive over $500 million in grants for electric vehicle initiatives by July 2024 as follows:"}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "ae12468a-5c78-4be2-9390-9b14c2bf2609", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) the Central Bank of Mexico announce an interest rate cut by August 2024 and (b) Fisker receive over $500 million in grants for electric vehicle initiatives by July 2024?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as YES if the Central Bank of Mexico officially announces an interest rate cut to take effect by August 31, 2024.

Firstly, for event (a), the Central Bank of Mexico announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024, we need to consider the country's economic situation and monetary policy decisions. Mexico's economy has been experiencing inflationary pressures, which might prompt the Central Bank to adjust interest rates to control inflation. However, the Central Bank's decisions are often influenced by various factors, including inflation rates, economic growth, and global events. Without specific information on the Central Bank's current stance or potential future decisions, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether they will announce an interest rate cut by August 2024. Secondly, for event (b), Fisker receiving over $500 million in grants for electric vehicle initiatives by July 2024, we need to consider the company's plans and the U.S. government's policies on electric vehicle incentives. Fisker has been actively seeking funding for its electric vehicle projects, and the U.S. government has been promoting electric vehicle adoption through various initiatives. However, the specifics of any potential grants or funding deals are not publicly known, and it's uncertain whether Fisker will meet the $500 million threshold by July 2024. Given the lack of specific information on the Central Bank of Mexico's interest rate decisions and Fisker's grant funding, it's difficult to assign high probabilities to either event. However, considering the general trend of central banks adjusting interest rates in response to economic conditions and the U.S. government's support for electric vehicle initiatives, I would argue that both events are not entirely unlikely."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, it's essential to note that as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, there were no major strikes at Google. However, labor disputes and unionization efforts are ongoing in the tech industry, and Google has faced labor unionization attempts in the past.

Assuming a strike does occur, the probability of it lasting at least one week is moderate. Strikes often begin with a strong show of support but can falter or be resolved through negotiations within a week or two. Regarding the resolution, Google has a history of resolving disputes through negotiations, and the company has a vested interest in avoiding prolonged strikes that could harm its operations and reputation.

As a result, the company has been diversifying its business and exploring new technologies, including AI.

Currently, Maine is the only state with a mandatory 72-hour waiting period for voting registration. Other states have different waiting periods or no waiting period at all. The likelihood of at least one additional state implementing a 72-hour waiting period by August 2024 depends on the current political climate, state legislation, and public opinion.

For the first condition, avoiding a recession, I'll consider the following factors: The French economy has experienced a recession in the past, but it has also shown resilience and ability to recover. The current economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation, and employment rates, suggest a moderate growth trend. The European Central Bank's monetary policy and the French government's fiscal policy have been supportive of economic growth. However, there are also potential risks, such as the ongoing global economic uncertainty, the impact of the war in Ukraine, and the potential for a slowdown in global trade. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of the French economy avoiding a recession by July 2024 to be around 60%. For the second condition, the Central Bank of Mexico's preferred inflation measure showing a monthly increase exceeding 0.5%, I'll consider the following factors: The Central Bank of Mexico has been targeting an inflation rate of around 3%, and the current inflation rate is slightly above this target. The country has experienced a period of high inflation in the past, but it has also shown a willingness to take action to control inflation. The current economic indicators, such as GDP growth and employment rates, suggest a moderate growth trend.

As major players in this space, YouTube and Google are likely to be affected by these trends. 3. Regulatory environment: The U.S. government has been actively pursuing regulatory actions against big tech companies, including antitrust lawsuits and investigations. This environment increases the likelihood of new legal actions against YouTube and Google. 4. Recent developments: Between October 1, 2023, and the resolution date (August 31, 2024), there have been no major announcements of new legal actions against YouTube or Google. However, this does not necessarily indicate a decrease in the likelihood of future actions, as regulatory processes can take time. 5. Probability of new legal actions: Given the history, current trends, and regulatory environment, it's reasonable to assume that both YouTube and Google will face new legal actions. However, the exact timing and nature of these actions are uncertain. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of both YouTube and Google facing additional legal actions from the U.S. government by August 2024 as follows:"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04126086487768266, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.013753621625894219, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28988551782622424, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

To determine the likelihood of the court not reversing or significantly altering this decision by July 2024, I'll consider the following factors: The court's decision was a significant departure from previous laws, which might make it more difficult to reverse or alter. The decision was made in 2023, and there hasn't been any major development that would suggest the court is likely to reverse or alter its stance in the near future.

For condition (b), the HHS's rule on telehealth services needs to be enacted by August 2024. To estimate the likelihood of this occurring, I'll consider the following factors: The HHS has been actively working on telehealth regulations, and there have been several proposals and drafts released in the past. The Biden administration has been supportive of expanding telehealth services, which might increase the likelihood of the rule being enacted. However, the rule-making process can be complex and time-consuming, and there might be opposition from various stakeholders.

To determine the likelihood of the base rate remaining at or above 3.50% in August 2024, I'll examine the following factors: 1. Inflationary pressures: Korea's inflation rate has been above the BOK's target rate, which may lead the central bank to maintain a relatively high base rate to control inflation. 2.

Firstly, let's consider the likelihood of Facebook's AI content moderation system being reported for spreading election misinformation. Facebook has faced criticism and controversy in the past regarding its content moderation policies and the spread of misinformation on its platform. Given the company's history and the ongoing efforts to regulate and monitor online content, it is plausible that its AI system could be reported for spreading election misinformation.

Mississippi has been a focal point for abortion rights debates in the US, with several high-profile cases and legislative efforts in recent years. The state has also experienced significant changes in abortion laws, including the implementation of a 15-week abortion ban.

First, I'll assess the likelihood of New York holding a referendum on marijuana legalization by July 2024. In 2021, New York passed a law to legalize recreational marijuana, but it did not include a provision for a referendum on the law. However, there have been discussions and proposals for a constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana through a referendum. Given the state's history of passing progressive policies, it's possible that a referendum on marijuana legalization could be held in the future. However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that a referendum is currently planned or imminent. Therefore, I'll assign a moderate probability to this event. Next, I'll evaluate the likelihood of Pennsylvania holding a referendum on tax reform by August 2024. Pennsylvania has a history of holding referendums on various issues, including tax-related ones. In 2022, the state held a referendum on a constitutional amendment to increase the minimum wage, which indicates that the state is willing to hold referendums on significant policy issues. While there's no concrete evidence of a planned tax reform referendum, it's possible that the state could hold one in the near future, especially given the ongoing discussions on tax policy in the state legislature. Therefore, I'll assign a moderate probability to this event as well. Considering these assessments, I'll combine the probabilities to estimate the likelihood of both events occurring. Since the events are independent, I'll multiply the probabilities. However, I'll also consider the fact that the second event (Pennsylvania's referendum on tax reform) has a slightly longer timeframe (August 2024) compared to the first event (New York's referendum on marijuana legalization by July 2024). This might increase the likelihood of the second event occurring, but I'll still assign a moderate probability to both events. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of both events occurring as 0.4."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04927599526023796, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.016425331753412653, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3158332209274327, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, let's consider the UAW's endorsement of a Republican candidate. Historically, the UAW has been a strong supporter of Democratic candidates and has endorsed Democratic presidential candidates in the past. While it's not unprecedented for a union to endorse a Republican, it's relatively rare. Given the UAW's political leanings, I'd assign a low probability to this event occurring. However, it's essential to note that the UAW has been known to take a more pragmatic approach in recent years, and they may consider factors like the candidate's stance on labor issues, which could potentially lead to an endorsement of a Republican candidate. Therefore, while it's still unlikely, I wouldn't rule it out entirely. Next, let's consider the U.S. government announcing plans to build additional nuclear reactors. The U.S. has been shifting its energy policy towards a more nuclear-focused approach, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy independence. The current administration has taken steps to support nuclear energy, including allocating funds for new reactor development and reviving the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. Given this context, it's plausible that the U.S. government might announce plans to build additional reactors beyond the current two. However, the process of building new nuclear reactors is complex and time-consuming, requiring significant investment and regulatory approvals. Therefore, while it's not impossible, it's also not a certainty. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of the UAW endorsing a Republican candidate as around 0.15 (15%), as it goes against their historical trend and would require significant changes in their stance. For the U.S. government announcing plans to build additional nuclear reactors, I'd estimate the probability as around 0.55 (55%), given the current energy policy shift and the administration's support for nuclear energy. To calculate the probability of both events occurring, I'd multiply the individual probabilities together, as they are independent events.

Firstly, the mpox outbreak in Nigeria is a relatively recent development, and it's difficult to predict the trajectory of the outbreak with certainty. However, we can look at the general trends and responses of similar outbreaks in the past. Typically, mpox outbreaks have a relatively short duration, often peaking within 6-12 months and then gradually declining. Given that the outbreak in Nigeria has been ongoing for a few months, it's possible that it may be nearing its peak or has already started to decline. Another factor to consider is the response of the Nigerian health authorities and the WHO. If they have been proactive in their response, implementing effective measures to contain the outbreak, it's possible that they may be able to bring it under control and declare it over by July 2024. However, if the response has been slow or inadequate, it's more likely that the outbreak will continue. Additionally, we can look at the current situation on the ground. If there have been reports of a significant decrease in cases or a decline in the number of new infections, it may indicate that the outbreak is under control and that a declaration of over could be made. However, there are also factors that could work against a declaration of over. For example, if there are still a significant number of cases being reported, or if the outbreak is still spreading to new areas, it's likely that the declaration will not be made. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of the mpox outbreak in Nigeria being declared over by July 2024 as follows: I would assign a probability of 0.4 (or 40%) to the outbreak being declared over by July 2024. This is based on the assumption that the Nigerian health authorities and the WHO have been proactive in their response, and that the outbreak is nearing its peak or has already started to decline.

Condition (a) requires the Bank of England to announce an interest rate cut by August 31, 2024. This is a relatively specific event that can be influenced by various economic factors, such as inflation, economic growth, and global events. Historically, the Bank of England has made interest rate decisions based on its monetary policy committee's assessment of the economy. Given the current economic environment, there is a possibility that the Bank of England might consider an interest rate cut to stimulate economic growth or address inflation concerns. However, this decision is not guaranteed and depends on various factors, including the committee's assessment of the economy and global events.

Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of condition (a) occurring as around 0.4 (40%). This is because, while there is a possibility of an interest rate cut, it's not a guaranteed outcome and depends on various factors.

However, there are also factors that could mitigate the likelihood of a tariff being implemented. The EU has been actively promoting renewable energy and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels, which might lead the Commission to prioritize other policies over tariffs.

For part (a), Google's settlement with the UK data protection authority, we can look at past precedents and the current state of negotiations. Google has faced several regulatory challenges in the UK, including a \u00a33.2 billion fine in 2021 for antitrust issues. However, the company has a history of resolving such disputes through settlements, often with favorable terms. The UK data protection authority has also demonstrated a willingness to work with companies to resolve disputes through settlements. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Google reaching a settlement with the UK data protection authority as around 70-80%. For part (b), the European Commission implementing a tariff on Chinese-made solar panels, we can look at the European Commission's recent trade policies and the current trade tensions between the EU and China. The EU has been actively pursuing trade protectionist policies, including tariffs on Chinese goods, and the solar panel industry has been a focus of these efforts. However, the implementation of a 50% or higher tariff on Chinese-made solar panels is a significant step, and the European Commission may face resistance from various stakeholders, including the solar industry and other member states. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of the European Commission implementing such a tariff as around 40-50%. Combining the probabilities of both events, we can use the multiplication rule for independent events. This means that the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore, the combined probability of Google reaching a settlement with the UK data protection authority and the European Commission implementing a significant tariff on Chinese-made solar panels is around 0.7 * 0.45 = 0.315."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

As of June 2024, tensions between the two countries may still be high, particularly with regards to issues like intellectual property theft, cybersecurity concerns, and human rights abuses. This could make it more likely that tariffs remain in place.

There could be a desire to gradually reduce tensions and tariffs to facilitate economic cooperation. Looking at historical trends, 100% tariffs on Chinese-made machinery were imposed by the US in 2020 as part of the ongoing trade war. Over time, some tariffs have been reduced or removed. However, other tariffs, including those on machinery, have remained in place or been increased. Given the complexity of the situation, it's challenging to determine the likelihood of the 100% tariff remaining intact through August 2024.

Regulatory environment: Nigeria has a relatively strict regulatory environment, and the government has shown a willingness to take action against unauthorized financial activities. This environment makes it more likely that the ban will be maintained. 3.

Public opinion: There is no significant public outcry or demand for the reversal of the ban, which suggests that the government may not feel pressured to lift it. 5. Economic factors: Nigeria's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, and the government may prioritize maintaining control over financial transactions to ensure stability and revenue collection. However, there are also factors that could potentially lead to the ban being lifted or weakened: 1.

Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Nigeria maintaining its ban on cryptocurrency transactions through August 2024 is around 0.7.

However, President Putin's influence over the Council is significant, and it is likely that he will exert pressure to block any bills that he opposes. Secondly, the Russian government has been facing significant economic challenges, including high inflation, a decline in the ruble, and a large budget deficit.

First, let's consider Nigeria's ban on cryptocurrency transactions. As of my knowledge cutoff, Nigeria has been actively considering a ban on cryptocurrency transactions, and in February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a circular directing banks to close accounts related to cryptocurrency transactions. However, in 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced a reversal of this decision and indicated that banks could facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. However, in 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a new circular stating that banks cannot provide services to customers who trade in cryptocurrencies. This indicates that the ban is subject to change and that the Nigerian government may not maintain a consistent stance on the issue. Given this context, I would rate the likelihood of Nigeria maintaining its ban on cryptocurrency transactions through August 2024 as relatively low. I assign a probability of 0.2, as the ban has already been reversed once before, and it's possible that the government may reconsider its stance or relax the ban in the future. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Russia's Federation Council passing a major economic reform bill opposed by President Putin. As of my knowledge cutoff, there are ongoing discussions about economic reforms in Russia, and President Putin has expressed concerns about the potential impact of certain reforms on the Russian economy. However, the likelihood of the Federation Council passing a major economic reform bill opposed by President Putin is uncertain, as the Russian government has a history of passing laws that align with the President's priorities. Given this context, I would rate the likelihood of Russia's Federation Council passing a major economic reform bill opposed by President Putin as relatively low. I assign a probability of 0.15, as the Russian government's decision-making process is often opaque, and it's difficult to predict the outcome of legislative efforts. Considering both conditions, the overall probability that Nigeria will maintain its ban on cryptocurrency transactions through August 2024 and Russia's Federation Council will pass a major economic reform bill opposed by President Putin is the product of the individual probabilities.

For condition (a), the Indonesian economy's performance is subject to various macroeconomic factors, including global economic trends, domestic policy decisions, and external shocks. While there are some positive indicators, such as a growing middle class and increasing foreign investment, the country's economy is also vulnerable to external factors like commodity price fluctuations and global trade tensions. Given the current economic climate, I would assign a moderate probability to the Indonesian economy avoiding a recession. For condition (b), the WHO's declaration of the measles outbreak being over would depend on the effectiveness of public health responses, vaccination efforts, and the spread of the disease. While there have been significant efforts to control the outbreak, the situation remains fluid, and the WHO's declaration would likely be based on careful analysis of the disease's trajectory. Considering the complexity of the situation and the uncertainties involved, I would assign a lower probability to the WHO declaring the outbreak over by August 2024. Given these assessments, I would combine the probabilities of both conditions occurring to estimate the overall probability. However, since the conditions are not independent, I would need to consider the potential correlations between the two. For instance, a strong economy might be more resilient to public health crises, while a well-managed public health response might also contribute to economic stability. Assuming some degree of correlation between the two conditions, I would estimate the probability of both occurring as follows: Probability of condition (a) occurring: 0.6 (moderate probability, given the Indonesian economy's vulnerabilities and potential for external shocks) Probability of condition (b) occurring: 0.3 (lower probability, given the complexities of the measles outbreak and the uncertainties involved) To combine these probabilities, I would use a simple product rule, assuming some degree of correlation between the two conditions.

Firstly, President Biden has a history of engaging with various labor unions, including the National Education Association (NEA), which is a significant player in the education sector. This suggests that he may be inclined to attend an NEA event in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state in the upcoming election cycle. Secondly, Pennsylvania is a crucial state for the Democratic Party, and the NEA has a significant presence there. It's possible that President Biden may choose to campaign in the state or attend events that align with his administration's priorities, such as education policy. Thirdly, while the resolution date is still several months away, it's not uncommon for high-profile events like this to be planned and announced well in advance. If the event is indeed scheduled to take place in Pennsylvania, it's likely that the White House and NEA would make official announcements and arrangements in the coming weeks or months. However, there are also factors that could reduce the likelihood of President Biden attending the event. For instance, his schedule may be filled with other commitments, such as official state visits, international diplomacy, or campaign events in other critical states.

However, the state's governor, Kim Reynolds, has expressed support for restricting abortion but has not explicitly endorsed a total ban. 2. Recent abortion-related legislation: In 2023, Iowa passed a 6-week abortion ban, which was signed into law by Governor Reynolds. This suggests that the state's lawmakers are willing to restrict abortion access, but it's unclear if they will go as far as a total ban. 3. Public opinion and activism: Abortion is a highly polarizing issue in the United States, and Iowa is no exception. Pro-choice and pro-life groups are likely to be actively engaged in the legislative process, which could influence the outcome. 4.

For (a), Cruise's robotaxis availability on Didi's ride-hailing service in China by August 2024, I'll consider the following factors: 1. Cruise's progress: Cruise has been actively working on developing and deploying robotaxis in various cities, including those in China. They have made significant progress in recent years, and it's likely that they will continue to expand their services. 2. Didi's partnership: Didi has partnered with Cruise to integrate their robotaxis into Didi's ride-hailing platform. This partnership suggests that Didi is committed to supporting Cruise's efforts and is likely to make their robotaxis available to regular users. 3. Regulatory environment: China has been actively promoting the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles, including robotaxis. This favorable regulatory environment is likely to support Cruise's efforts to make their robotaxis available on Didi's platform. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Cruise's robotaxis being available on Didi's ride-hailing service in China by August 2024 to be around 0.7 (70%). For (b), Baidu's announcement of measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption by July 2024, I'll consider the following factors: 1. Baidu's commitment to sustainability: Baidu has been actively promoting sustainability and reducing its environmental impact. They have set ambitious targets to reduce their carbon footprint and are likely to take concrete steps to achieve these goals. 2. Industry trends: The tech industry is increasingly focusing on sustainability and reducing energy consumption. Baidu is likely to follow this trend and announce measures to reduce its AI-related electricity consumption. 3. Regulatory pressure: China has been actively promoting sustainable development and reducing energy consumption. Baidu may face regulatory pressure to announce measures to reduce its AI-related electricity consumption. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Baidu announcing measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption by July 2024 to be around 0.8 (80%). Since the two events are independent, I'll multiply the probabilities to estimate the probability that both events will occur: 0.7 (Cruise's robotaxis availability) \u00d7 0.8 (Baidu's announcement) = 0.56.

Firstly, the trend of unionization in the tech industry, particularly in the US, has been increasing in recent years. This is evident from the growing number of companies facing unionization efforts, including Amazon, Starbucks, and Google. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers' Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM) has been actively organizing Apple store employees, and the recent unionization efforts at various Apple stores suggest a strong interest in collective bargaining. However, the complexity and potential resistance from Apple's management could hinder the negotiation process. Apple has historically been opposed to unionization, and the company might employ tactics to delay or prevent the unionization efforts.

Historically, jobless claims have been relatively high during recessions. However, the U.S. labor market has been resilient in recent years, with low unemployment rates and a strong job market.

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers' Coalition of Organized Retail Employees has been actively organizing Apple store employees. Apple has a history of resisting unionization efforts, but the company has also shown a willingness to engage in collective bargaining. The probability of a successful union contract negotiation and signing between Apple and the union is difficult to estimate, but it is not impossible.

This suggests that the economy is not currently experiencing a recessionary trend. The impact of global economic trends: The Australian economy is heavily reliant on international trade, and global economic trends can have a significant impact on its performance. However, the global economy is also expected to experience a moderate growth rate in 2024, which may help mitigate the risk of a recession in Australia. The Australian government's economic policies: The Australian government has implemented various policies to stimulate economic growth, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending. These policies may help support the economy and reduce the risk of a recession. The Australian Reserve Bank's interest rate decisions: The Reserve Bank of Australia has kept interest rates relatively low, which may help support economic growth and reduce the risk of a recession. The Australian economy's debt-to-GDP ratio: As of my knowledge cutoff, Australia's debt-to-GDP ratio is relatively low compared to other developed economies. This suggests that the economy has a strong fiscal foundation and may be less vulnerable to a recession. The current economic indicators: The current economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, inflation rate, and consumer confidence, are also within reasonable ranges, suggesting that the economy is not experiencing a significant downturn. However, there are also some risks that could potentially lead to a recession, including: The impact of the ongoing trade tensions between Australia and its major trading partners, particularly China. The potential for a global economic downturn, which could impact Australia's export-oriented industries. The risk of a housing market correction, which could have a negative impact on the economy.

However, we can consider some possible scenarios: 1. Economic factors: If there is a significant economic downturn or a substantial increase in interest rates, it could lead to a decline in home sales. However, this would likely be a broad market impact, rather than a specific trend in previously occupied home sales. 2.

Firstly, regarding the Australian economy avoiding a recession, we can look at historical data and forecasts from reputable sources. The Australian economy has experienced a few recessions in the past, but it has also shown resilience and adaptability. Given the current economic conditions, including low unemployment and moderate GDP growth, the risk of a recession appears to be relatively low. However, it's essential to consider the uncertainty associated with economic forecasts, which can be influenced by various factors such as global events, monetary policy, and domestic economic indicators. Next, regarding U.S. previously occupied home sales showing a decline for two consecutive months, we can examine historical trends and data from reputable sources like the National Association of Realtors. Home sales in the U.S. have experienced fluctuations due to various factors such as interest rates, housing market conditions, and economic indicators. While it's challenging to predict short-term trends, we can consider the likelihood of a decline in home sales based on current economic conditions and historical patterns. To estimate the joint probability of both conditions occurring, we need to consider the independence of the two events. If the Australian economy avoids a recession and U.S. home sales decline, it's possible that these events are related, but they are not directly correlated. Therefore, we can assume that the two events are independent, and we can multiply their individual probabilities to estimate the joint probability. Given the analysis above, I would estimate the probability of the Australian economy avoiding a recession by July 2024 as 0.7 (70%), considering the relatively low risk of a recession and the uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. Regarding U.S. previously occupied home sales showing a decline for two consecutive months, I would estimate the probability as 0.5 (50%), considering the fluctuations in home sales due to various economic and market factors.

However, the declaration of an outbreak being 'over' is a formal announcement by the WHO, which may not necessarily reflect the complete eradication of the virus.

However, under the leadership of President Lula, there have been efforts to implement policies aimed at stimulating economic growth, such as investing in infrastructure, increasing social spending, and promoting business-friendly reforms. Additionally, the Brazilian government has also implemented measures to control inflation, including monetary policy decisions by the Central Bank of Brazil, which has raised interest rates to curb inflation.

However, there are scenarios where a company might choose to allow generic production. For instance, if Takeda is facing significant competition from generic versions of its drug, it might decide to license its patent to generic manufacturers to maintain market share. Alternatively, the company might be involved in a settlement agreement with generic manufacturers, which could include provisions for patent non-enforcement. Another factor to consider is the regulatory environment.

Firstly, regarding the economic reform bill, there are several factors to consider. Russia's economic policy is heavily influenced by President Putin, and any significant reforms would require a significant shift in his stance or a major change in the political landscape. While there have been attempts at economic reform in the past, they have often been met with resistance from Putin and his administration. However, there have been recent signs of a potential shift in Russia's economic policy, with proposals for reforms aimed at addressing the country's economic challenges.

Considering both conditions are independent of each other, we can multiply the probabilities to find the probability of both occurring.

The state has a specific process for placing constitutional amendments on the ballot, which involves a petition drive and a vote by the General Assembly.

Firstly, the Brazilian economy has been growing steadily over the past few years, with a stable inflation rate and a robust manufacturing sector. This growth is likely to continue, driving the Bovespa index upwards. However, the index has experienced significant fluctuations in the past, and there are risks associated with the ongoing economic recovery, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and potential changes in global trade policies. Historical data on the Bovespa index suggests that it has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with some minor corrections. However, the index has not yet reached the 130,000 point level, which is a significant milestone. To estimate the probability of reaching this level, I will consider the historical growth rate of the index and the current market conditions. Historical analysis shows that the Bovespa index has grown at an average annual rate of around 20-30% over the past few years. However, this growth rate is not consistent, and the index has experienced significant corrections. To estimate the probability of reaching 130,000 points, I will assume a moderate growth rate of 25% per annum. Using this growth rate, I calculate that the Bovespa index would need to grow by around 30-40% from its current level to reach 130,000 points. This is a reasonable assumption, given the historical growth rate of the index. However, there are risks associated with this growth, such as market volatility and potential corrections. To estimate the probability of reaching 130,000 points, I will consider the historical probability of the index experiencing a correction of 30-40% within a 10-month period. Historical data suggests that the index has experienced corrections of this magnitude around 20-30% of the time. Taking into account these factors, I estimate that the probability of the Bovespa index reaching or exceeding 130,000 points by August 2024 is around 50-60%.

First, let's consider the Bovespa index reaching or exceeding 130,000 points. Brazil's stock market has been volatile in recent years, influenced by factors like inflation, economic growth, and global market trends. While there have been periods of significant growth, the index has also experienced declines. To estimate the likelihood of the Bovespa reaching 130,000 points, I'll consider the historical performance of the index and the current economic climate. Historically, the Bovespa has shown an upward trend, but with significant fluctuations. In 2022, the index reached a peak of around 140,000 points, but then declined due to economic concerns. As of now, the index is around 90,000 points. Considering the current economic situation, including inflation and interest rates, it's challenging to predict a significant increase to 130,000 points by August 2024. However, it's not impossible, especially if there's a significant improvement in the global economy or a change in monetary policy. Now, let's consider the Central Bank of Mexico announcing an interest rate cut. The Bank of Mexico has been cautious in its monetary policy decisions, often prioritizing inflation control over economic growth. However, there have been instances where the bank has cut interest rates in response to economic downturns or to stimulate growth. The current interest rate is around 12%, and a cut could be considered if the economy slows down or if there's a significant improvement in inflation. While it's uncertain whether a rate cut will occur by August 2024, it's not entirely unlikely, especially if the Mexican economy experiences a downturn. Given these considerations, I'll estimate the probability of each condition occurring. The Bovespa reaching 130,000 points is relatively low, around 0.2, due to the challenges in the current economic climate and the historical volatility of the index. The probability of the Central Bank of Mexico announcing an interest rate cut is slightly higher, around 0.35, considering the bank's past decisions and the current economic situation. To estimate the probability of both conditions occurring, I'll use the product of the individual probabilities. This is a conservative approach, as it assumes independence between the two events.

However, since 2020, the market has experienced a significant surge in prices, driven by low interest rates, government policies, and a shortage of housing supply. Looking at current data, the Canadian housing market has shown signs of slowing down, with some indicators pointing to a potential correction. For instance, the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) reported a decline in home sales in recent months. Additionally, some experts have predicted a moderate decline in housing prices in the coming months due to rising interest rates and a potential economic downturn. However, it's essential to note that the Canadian housing market is highly regional, and prices can vary significantly depending on the location. Some areas, such as Vancouver and Toronto, have historically experienced more rapid price growth than others.

Component (a): France's weekly jobless claims have been fluctuating over the years. According to data from the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), in 2020, weekly jobless claims averaged around 12,000 to 15,000, but increased to around 20,000 to 25,000 in 2021 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the average decreased to around 15,000 to 20,000. However, these numbers might not accurately represent the current situation, as the resolution date is August 2024. Therefore, it's difficult to predict whether the claims will exceed 200,000 for three consecutive weeks based on past data alone.

Component (b): The Bank of England's (BoE) interest rate decisions are often influenced by inflation, economic growth, and other economic indicators. Historically, the BoE has followed a relatively dovish stance, cutting interest rates in response to economic downturns. Given the current global economic environment, with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, high inflation, and a slowing global economy, it's possible that the BoE might consider cutting interest rates to stimulate growth. However, the decision to cut interest rates depends on various factors, including the UK's economic data, inflation rates, and the global economic outlook. While there's a reasonable chance of an interest rate cut, it's uncertain whether the cut will happen by July 2024.

Condition (a) requires a monthly increase in the Central Bank of Russia's preferred inflation measure exceeding 0.5% in any single month between October 2023 and July 31, 2024. The probability of a single month's inflation rate exceeding 0.5% is difficult to estimate without specific data, but considering the general trend of inflation rates, I'll assume a moderate increase in inflation is possible. Given the time frame, there are 10 months (from October 2023 to July 2024) where this condition could be met. To simplify the calculation, I'll assume a uniform probability of 0.1 (or 10%) for each month's inflation rate exceeding 0.5%. This assumption is conservative, as the actual probability might be higher. The probability of condition (a) occurring at least once in the 10-month period is 1 minus the probability of it not occurring in any of the 10 months. Using the complement rule, the probability of condition (a) not occurring in a single month is 0.9 (1 - 0.1). Therefore, the probability of condition (a) not occurring in all 10 months is (0.9)^10 \u2248 0.3487. The probability of condition (a) occurring at least once is 1 - 0.3487 \u2248 0.6513. Now, let's consider condition (b), which requires Elvira Nabiullina to remain as Governor of the Central Bank of Russia through July 31, 2024. The probability of this occurring depends on various factors, including the Central Bank of Russia's policies, the Russian government's decisions, and Elvira Nabiullina's personal circumstances. Based on available information, I'll assume a moderate probability of 0.7 (or 70%) that Elvira Nabiullina will remain as Governor through July 2024. To find the probability of both conditions occurring, I'll multiply the probabilities of conditions (a) and (b). The probability of condition (a) occurring is approximately 0.6513, and the probability of condition (b) occurring is 0.7. Therefore, the probability of both conditions occurring is 0.6513 * 0.7 \u2248 0.4551."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 2.623658865807954e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 8.74552955269318e-06, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.007237982885459125, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, with the global economic slowdown and potential impact of the US Fed's rate cuts, there is a possibility of a rate cut to boost economic growth. Historically, the RBI has been cautious in cutting interest rates, but there have been instances where they have done so to support the economy.

Economic Conditions: The question doesn't provide specific details about the current economic conditions in Nigeria as of the resolution date. However, if the economy is experiencing a downturn, the CBN might be more likely to consider an interest rate cut to stimulate growth. Conversely, if the economy is growing robustly, they might be less inclined to cut rates. 2. Inflation Rate: The CBN's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) often considers inflation rates when making decisions about interest rates. If inflation is high, the CBN might increase interest rates to combat inflation, not cut them. 3. Global Economic Trends: Global economic trends, particularly those affecting commodity prices and international trade, could influence the CBN's decision. If global factors are pressuring the Nigerian economy, the CBN might respond with an interest rate cut. 4. Previous Monetary Policy Decisions: The CBN's past actions and statements might provide insight into their current stance on interest rates. If they have recently cut rates or indicated a willingness to do so, it could increase the likelihood of another cut. 5. Communication from the CBN: Official statements and press releases from the CBN are crucial. If there have been hints or suggestions that the CBN is considering an interest rate cut, this would increase the likelihood of an announcement by August. Given the lack of specific information about the current economic conditions, inflation rate, or the CBN's recent decisions, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction.

However, the fact that the question specifies a separate announcement for additional layoffs suggests that Tesla might be trying to avoid further negative publicity. I'll also consider the current economic climate, which might influence Tesla's decision to make further layoffs. The automotive industry, including electric vehicles, has been affected by supply chain disruptions, inflation, and declining demand. These factors might lead Tesla to reassess its workforce needs and potentially make further cuts. However, the question also specifies that the announcement must be confirmed through official company statements or reports from at least two reputable news sources.

Firstly, let's consider Tesla's announcement of additional layoffs. The initial 6% workforce reduction was reported, and it's possible that the company might announce further cuts. However, there's no clear indication of the likelihood of this happening. Tesla has been undergoing significant restructuring efforts, and it's possible that the company might need to make further adjustments to its workforce. However, without more information, it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of this happening. Next, let's consider General Motors' resolution of a major workers' strike. The strike must involve a substantial number of workers, last for at least one week, and be resolved through official statements from both General Motors and the involved union. The resolution must also be reported by at least two reputable international news sources. Given the complexity of labor negotiations and the potential for strikes, it's possible that a major strike could occur and be resolved. However, the likelihood of this happening is also difficult to estimate without more information. Combining these two events, we need to consider the likelihood of both occurring together. Since the events are not directly related, we can assume that they are independent. Therefore, we can multiply the probabilities of each event occurring separately to get the combined probability. Assuming a 30% chance of Tesla announcing additional layoffs (a rough estimate based on the company's restructuring efforts) and a 20% chance of General Motors resolving a major workers' strike (a rough estimate based on the complexity of labor negotiations), we can calculate the combined probability as follows: Combined probability = 0.3 (Tesla) x 0.2 (GM) = 0.06.

The pandemic led to a significant decrease in mortgage rates, and the Fed's actions, such as quantitative easing and cutting interest rates, further lowered rates. However, since 2022, mortgage rates have been rising due to inflation concerns and the Fed's efforts to control inflation by raising interest rates. Given this context, it's uncertain whether mortgage rates will continue to rise or fall in the coming months. However, considering the current economic environment, including high inflation and a strong labor market, it's possible that the Fed may continue to raise interest rates to control inflation, which could lead to higher mortgage rates. Another factor to consider is the impact of the US economy on mortgage rates.

For the first event, Indiana holding a referendum on abortion rights, I can look at the recent history of abortion-related referendums in the United States. While there have been several high-profile abortion-related bills and court cases, there hasn't been a statewide referendum on abortion rights in Indiana in recent years. However, the trend in the US has been towards more restrictive abortion laws, and some states have held referendums on abortion-related issues. Given the current political climate and the fact that several states have held abortion-related referendums in recent years, I would estimate the probability of Indiana holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024 as around 0.6 (60%). For the second event, another U.S. state adopting a Medicaid plan with a healthy behavior incentive, I can look at the existing Medicaid plans in the US and the trend towards incorporating incentives for healthy behaviors. While there are several existing Medicaid plans that include some form of incentives for healthy behaviors, such as wellness programs or rewards for preventive care, I couldn't find any information on a state adopting a plan with a healthy behavior incentive that is a key component of the plan. Given the trend towards incorporating more incentives for healthy behaviors in Medicaid plans, I would estimate the probability of another U.S. state adopting a Medicaid plan with a healthy behavior incentive by July 2024 as around 0.4 (40%). Since the two events are independent, I can multiply the probabilities of each event to get the probability of both events occurring.

Current global context: The world is facing numerous pressing issues, including the ongoing pandemic, economic uncertainty, and climate-related disasters. These factors may lead to increased demand for humanitarian assistance and development programs, which could result in the UNDP securing new funding commitments. 3.

This increases the likelihood of the NEA endorsing her. 4. Endorsement criteria: The question specifies that the endorsement must be confirmed through official NEA statements or reported by at least two reputable news sources. This suggests that the NEA is likely to publicly announce an endorsement if they decide to support Kamala Harris. However, there are also some factors that could lead to a NO outcome: 1. Lack of public information: The NEA has not publicly announced any plans to endorse Kamala Harris, which suggests that they may not have made a decision yet. 2. Competing interests: The NEA may be considering endorsements from other Democratic candidates, which could affect their decision to support Kamala Harris. Based on these factors, I would estimate the likelihood of the NEA endorsing Kamala Harris by July 2024 as follows:"}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "53927d61-c89a-41b2-9196-47789f60eabc", "title": "Will Kamala Harris announce her running mate at a rally in Philadelphia by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris publicly announces her running mate for the upcoming election at a rally held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Another factor to consider is the potential for external factors, such as changes in federal law or court decisions, to influence the decision to hold a referendum. For example, if the US Supreme Court were to overturn Roe v. Wade, it could create a sense of urgency for states like Maryland to take action on abortion rights.

Firstly, regarding the announcement of Kamala Harris's running mate, it's a relatively high-profile event that is likely to be widely reported by reputable news sources. Given the timeframe and the fact that Harris has been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, it's reasonable to assume that she will announce her running mate at a rally in New York City by August 2024. However, the exact timing and location of the announcement are subject to change, and there's a possibility that she might announce her running mate through other means or at a different location. Secondly, regarding the referendum on abortion rights in Maryland, it's a more complex process that requires the state government to formally announce and conduct the referendum. While there's a possibility that the referendum might be held by July 2024, there's also a risk that it might be canceled or postponed due to various reasons such as lack of support, logistical issues, or changes in the state government. Considering these factors, it's difficult to estimate the exact probability of both events occurring. However, based on the information provided and general knowledge, I would estimate the probability of Kamala Harris announcing her running mate at a rally in New York City by August 2024 as around 0.7 (70%). The probability of Maryland holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024 is more uncertain, but based on the fact that several states have held referendums on abortion rights in recent years, I would estimate the probability as around 0.4 (40%). Since the two events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities to get the overall probability of both events occurring. Therefore, the probability that both events occur is approximately 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.28 (28%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.008839838736450334, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0029466129121501114, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.13285444427865062, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This volatility makes it difficult to predict with certainty whether the economy will enter a recession. Thirdly, some economic indicators, such as the UK's manufacturing PMI, have shown signs of improvement in recent months, which could indicate a potential recovery in the economy. However, other indicators, such as the UK's unemployment rate and consumer confidence, have shown signs of weakness, which could suggest that the economy is still vulnerable to a recession.

While 'Kingsman: The Blue Blood' has been a successful film, there are other R-rated movies that have also performed well at the box office. The likelihood of it maintaining its position depends on various factors such as marketing campaigns, competition, and global box office trends. However, without specific data on the current box office performance of other R-rated movies, it is difficult to estimate the exact probability.

Firstly, the Central Bank's monetary policy decisions are influenced by the country's economic indicators, such as inflation, GDP growth, and unemployment rates. As of my knowledge cutoff, the Philippine economy has been facing challenges, including high inflation and a slowdown in economic growth. This might prompt the Central Bank to consider an interest rate cut to stimulate the economy. However, the Central Bank's decisions are also influenced by global economic trends and the country's external environment. The Philippine economy is heavily reliant on remittances from overseas Filipino workers and exports, which can be affected by global economic conditions. Additionally, the Central Bank must balance the need to stimulate the economy with the risk of higher inflation and currency depreciation. Given these factors, I'll consider the probability of an interest rate cut based on the Central Bank's past decisions and the current economic environment. The Central Bank has a history of using interest rates as a tool for monetary policy, and it has adjusted the overnight reverse repurchase rate in response to changes in the economy. However, the Central Bank has also been cautious in its monetary policy decisions, and it has often prioritized price stability over economic growth. This suggests that an interest rate cut might not be a certainty, even if the economy is facing challenges.

For condition (a), I'll consider the U.S. government's commitment to supporting electric vehicle initiatives, as evident from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which allocated $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging infrastructure and $2.5 billion for electric vehicle manufacturing and recycling facilities.

He has delivered speeches at numerous events, including those organized by education-focused groups. This suggests that he is likely to continue this trend in the future. 2. The National Education Association's (NEA) significance: The NEA is a prominent organization that represents teachers and education professionals in the United States. As a key stakeholder in the education sector, the NEA often hosts events that attract high-profile speakers, including the President. Given the NEA's influence and President Biden's interest in education, it's plausible that he would be invited to speak at one of their events in Arizona. 3. Arizona's importance: Arizona is a key state in the US, with a significant population and a growing economy. The state is also home to several major universities and education institutions, making it an attractive location for educational events. President Biden may see Arizona as a strategic location to promote his administration's education policies or engage with key stakeholders in the region. 4. Official announcements and news coverage: The question specifies that the speech must be confirmed by official White House announcements or reports from at least two reputable news sources.

The 100% tariff on Chinese-made textiles has been in place for some time, and it is likely that the US government would need a significant reason to alter this policy. However, the US has shown a willingness to adjust tariffs in the past, often in response to negotiations or economic pressures. Recent developments suggest that there is a possibility of a resolution to the trade tensions between the US and China, which could lead to a reduction or removal of the tariffs. The US and China have been engaging in trade talks, and there have been reports of potential agreements that could lead to a reduction in tariffs.

This suggests that the US government may be willing to make adjustments to the tariff policy in response to changing circumstances. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the US maintaining a 100% tariff on Chinese-made textiles through August 2024 is low to moderate.

In 2020, the US and China signed the Phase One trade agreement, which included a commitment to reduce tariffs on certain goods.

First, let's consider Kansas. While there is no concrete information in the prompt about Kansas' plans for a referendum, there have been recent developments in the state related to abortion rights. In 2022, Kansas voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have removed the right to abortion from the state constitution. This suggests that the issue of abortion rights is contentious in the state, and there may be efforts to revisit the issue. However, without explicit information about the state government's plans for a referendum, I'll assign a moderate probability to this event. Next, let's consider Michigan. Michigan has been a state with a history of contentious debates on abortion rights. In 2022, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the state's abortion laws were unconstitutional, effectively enshrining abortion rights in the state. Given this backdrop, it's plausible that the state government may consider a referendum to solidify abortion rights in the state constitution. However, without explicit information about the state government's plans for a referendum, I'll assign a moderate probability to this event as well.

However, without concrete information on ongoing lawsuits, it's challenging to assign significant probability to this event. (Probability: 10%) 2. Potential policy changes: With ongoing policy debates and potential shifts in state leadership, changes in Medicaid policies, like the removal of the work requirement, are plausible but hard to predict with precision. The probability of policymakers opting for a significant shift like this is not zero, but it's a significant undertaking that might face various hurdles. (Probability: 20%) 3. Public opposition: If there's a visible, organized public movement in opposition to the work requirement, it could lead the state to reconsider or abandon it. However, such a movement would likely result in some form of announcement or public discussion.

The difficulty of achieving this through under-the-radar actions would likely make it difficult for the resolution to happen unannounced.

These conditions might lead the Central Bank of Mexico to consider an interest rate cut to stimulate economic growth. Secondly, I'll examine the Central Bank of Mexico's past decisions regarding interest rates. The bank has been increasing interest rates in recent years to combat inflation, but it has also shown a willingness to cut rates when necessary to support the economy. For example, in 2020, the bank cut its interest rate by 100 basis points to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirdly, I'll consider the current monetary policy stance of other major central banks. The US Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, while the European Central Bank has been keeping rates low to support economic growth. The Bank of Mexico might follow a similar path to its peers in the region. Lastly, I'll look at any recent statements or actions from the Central Bank of Mexico that might indicate its intentions regarding interest rates.

First, regarding the Central Bank of South Korea, there is a precedent for South Korean central banks to explore digital payment systems. In 2020, the Bank of Korea, South Korea's central bank, announced a plan to launch a digital currency. However, the project was put on hold due to regulatory concerns. Nevertheless, the Central Bank of South Korea has continued to express interest in digital payments, and it's possible that they may announce a new system by August 2024. I assign a moderate probability to this event, around 60-70%. Second, regarding the Central Bank of Mexico, there is a history of interest rate cuts by the Bank of Mexico. In 2020, the bank cut interest rates to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, in 2022, the bank cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Given the current economic conditions in Mexico, it's possible that the Central Bank of Mexico may cut interest rates again by July 2024. I assign a higher probability to this event, around 80-90%. To estimate the probability of both events occurring, I will use the multiplication rule of probability.

While Virginia's plan may differ, it's likely that the initial enrollment will be modest. 2. Public awareness and outreach: The success of the program depends on public awareness and outreach efforts to inform eligible individuals about the program and its requirements. If the state has invested sufficient resources in promoting the program, it may be more likely to meet the enrollment target. 3. Demographics and population density: Virginia has a relatively high population density and a mix of urban and rural areas. This could potentially support higher enrollment numbers, as more people are likely to be aware of the program and have access to resources for enrollment. 4.

First, let's look at Pedro S\u00e1nchez. He has been the Prime Minister of Spain since 2018 and has a relatively stable government. However, Spanish politics can be unpredictable, and there is always a possibility of a change in government due to internal party conflicts or external factors. Boris Johnson, on the other hand, has been the Prime Minister of the UK since 2019 and has faced significant challenges, including Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. His leadership has been subject to controversy, and there have been several attempts to remove him from office. However, he has managed to stay in power so far. Given the current political landscape, it seems unlikely that either S\u00e1nchez or Johnson will be removed from office in the near future. However, there is always a possibility of unexpected events or changes in government that could lead to their removal. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Pedro S\u00e1nchez remaining Prime Minister of Spain through July 2024 as around 0.7 (70%).

The probability of Boris Johnson remaining Prime Minister of the UK through July 2024 is more uncertain, but I would estimate it as around 0.4 (40%).

This suggests that the Senate may be willing to challenge President Tinubu's administration on economic policy issues.

For event (a), the Central Bank of Indonesia announcing a new monetary easing policy, we need to consider the bank's past actions and the current economic situation. The Central Bank of Indonesia has a history of implementing monetary easing policies during times of economic stress. Given the current global economic outlook, which includes a potential recession, it is plausible that the Central Bank of Indonesia may announce a new monetary easing policy to support the economy. However, the timing and content of such a policy are uncertain. For event (b), the Singapore Straits Times Index reaching or exceeding 4,000 points, we need to consider the index's past performance and the current market trends. The Straits Times Index has been on an upward trend, driven by the recovery of the global economy and the growth of the Singaporean economy. However, the index's performance is subject to various market and economic factors, including global economic trends, interest rates, and investor sentiment.

Firstly, regarding Iowa's law, there are several factors to consider. The law has been in place since 2022, and there have been attempts to repeal or modify it, but so far, none have been successful. However, there have been court challenges, and it's possible that a court ruling could invalidate the law. Additionally, the Iowa state legislature could potentially repeal the law during their next session. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Iowa's law being overturned by July 2024 as around 40%. This is a relatively low probability because, despite the challenges to the law, it has been in place for some time, and there are no guarantees that a repeal or invalidation will occur. Secondly, regarding Colorado's law, there are also several factors to consider. Colorado's law has been in place since 2020, and it has been a subject of debate and potential changes. However, as of now, there are no indications that the law will be changed or repealed. In fact, Colorado has been a stronghold for abortion rights, and it's likely that the law will remain unchanged. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Colorado's law remaining unchanged by August 2024 as around 70%. This is a relatively high probability because, despite the potential for changes, there are no clear indications that the law will be altered. Now, to estimate the probability that both conditions are met, I'll multiply the probabilities of each condition being met.

Firstly, the likelihood of Maduro making a public statement condemning the attack depends on his past behavior and stance on similar situations. Maduro's administration has been known for its authoritarian tendencies and suppression of opposition voices, including Maria Corina Machado, a prominent Venezuelan opposition leader. Given this context, it's possible that Maduro might avoid directly condemning the attack on her headquarters to avoid fueling opposition sentiment and maintaining his grip on power. However, there are also factors that could motivate Maduro to issue a condemnation. The international community's response to the attack, particularly from countries that have diplomatic relations with Venezuela, might influence his decision. If there's significant international pressure, Maduro might feel compelled to respond to avoid diplomatic fallout. Additionally, the Venezuelan opposition and international organizations might continue to raise awareness about the attack and its implications, potentially creating a public pressure that could lead to a condemnation. Lastly, the lack of a clear and explicit condemnation from Maduro by the resolution date would suggest that he is unlikely to make a statement, as it would be a missed opportunity to address the situation and potentially mitigate potential diplomatic repercussions.

Condition 1: A major social media platform is reported for spreading election misinformation through its AI systems. This is a plausible scenario, given the increasing concerns about AI-generated misinformation on social media platforms. In recent years, there have been several instances of social media platforms being criticized for spreading misinformation through their AI systems. For example, in 2022, a study found that Facebook's AI-powered recommendation algorithm was promoting misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. Similarly, in 2023, a report by the Knight Foundation found that Twitter's AI-powered moderation system was failing to detect and remove hate speech and misinformation. Given the ongoing concerns about AI-generated misinformation, it's likely that a major social media platform will be reported for spreading election misinformation through its AI systems by August 2024. I estimate the probability of this condition being met as 0.7. Condition 2: Nicolas Maduro publicly condemns the attack on Maria Corina Machado's headquarters.

However, the current inflation rate in India is relatively high, and the RBI may be cautious about cutting rates too soon. Secondly, the global economic outlook is uncertain, with potential risks from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, rising oil prices, and the impact of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions on emerging markets. These factors could lead the RBI to maintain a cautious stance on interest rates. Thirdly, the RBI has been using unconventional monetary policy tools, such as the Marginal Standing Facility rate, to manage liquidity and control inflation. While these tools have been effective, they may not be sufficient to stimulate economic growth, and a rate cut could be considered to boost lending and investment. Lastly, the RBI has a history of surprise rate cuts, and their decisions are often influenced by the state of the economy and the global environment.

First, let's consider President Biden's speech at a National Education Association event in Illinois. The NEA is a prominent organization, and President Biden has a history of delivering speeches at various events. Illinois is also a key state in the US, and the NEA has a significant presence there. While there's no guarantee, it's plausible that President Biden would choose to deliver a speech at an NEA event in Illinois, especially given his administration's focus on education and its efforts to engage with key stakeholders.

The US government has been actively promoting electric vehicle adoption, and California is a leader in this space. It's likely that the state would receive significant funding for electric vehicle-related initiatives, given its importance in the US's clean energy and transportation sectors.

This suggests that the concept of debt cancellation is gaining traction and may be more likely to happen. However, the specific requirement of canceling over $300 million in medical debt for at least 150,000 patients across multiple Northeastern states is a significant undertaking.

This is because the Central Bank of Chile has shown a willingness to adjust its interest rates in response to economic conditions, but there's no clear indication that a rate cut is imminent. Condition (b) requires Brazil to record a monthly job growth figure below 50,000 in any official jobs report by July 31, 2024. To estimate the probability of this occurring, I'll consider Brazil's labor market trends. Brazil's job market has been recovering from the pandemic, but it's still experiencing a relatively slow growth rate. While there's a possibility that the job growth rate could slow down or even decline, it's difficult to predict with certainty. I'll assign a lower probability to this event, around 40%. This is because Brazil's job market has been showing signs of improvement, and a significant decline in job growth is not a guaranteed outcome. Considering both conditions, I'll calculate the combined probability using the multiplication rule of probability.

First, let's consider the Swiss National Bank's interest rate cut. The SNB has been keeping interest rates low for a while, and there have been some hints of potential rate cuts in the past. However, the SNB has also been cautious in its monetary policy decisions, and a rate cut is not a certainty. Given the current economic conditions and the SNB's past behavior, I would estimate the probability of an interest rate cut by August 2024 as around 40%. This is a relatively low probability, as the SNB has been hesitant to make significant changes to its monetary policy in recent times. Next, let's consider Brazil's monthly job growth. Brazil's labor market has been recovering slowly from the pandemic, but job growth has been relatively steady, with some fluctuations. While there have been some concerns about the labor market's resilience, a monthly job growth figure below 50,000 is not an extreme outcome. In fact, Brazil's labor market has experienced periods of slower job growth in the past. Given the current economic conditions and the labor market's historical trends, I would estimate the probability of a monthly job growth figure below 50,000 by July 2024 as around 55%. This is a moderate probability, as job growth has been relatively steady in recent times. Now, to estimate the probability that both conditions will be met, I'll multiply the probabilities of each condition. This is a simplification, as the two conditions are not independent, but it's a reasonable approximation. The probability that both conditions will be met is approximately 0.4 x 0.55 = 0.22."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, there are some concerns that the economy might slow down due to various domestic and global factors such as high inflation, rising interest rates, and a decline in global demand. Despite these challenges, the Indian government has implemented several measures to boost economic growth, including fiscal stimulus packages and reforms to improve the business environment. Additionally, the country's large and diverse economy, as well as its strong demographic trends, are expected to provide a buffer against potential economic shocks. However, the key factor that will determine whether the economy enters a recession is the performance of the manufacturing and services sectors, which have been the main drivers of growth in recent years.

This is a relatively specific event that requires a public announcement by Harris herself during a rally in Charlotte, which is a significant undertaking that would likely be well-covered by the media. I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as 0.3 (30%), as it's a specific and public event that would require careful planning and coordination.

This event is more complex and would require the Minnesota state government to take a series of steps, including announcing and conducting the referendum, which would likely involve significant controversy and debate. I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as 0.4 (40%), as it's a more complex process that would require the state government to take a clear stance on abortion rights. To combine these probabilities, I'll use the multiplication rule, which states that the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. This gives us 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12, or 12%. However, this calculation assumes that the events are independent, which may not be the case. If there's a connection between the two events, such as a shared political context or a common decision-maker, the probability of both events occurring could be higher or lower.

However, PepsiCo has a strong brand portfolio and a large market share in North America, which could help mitigate the impact of these factors. Another factor to consider is the company's past performance. PepsiCo has consistently reported growth in its beverage sales in North America in recent years, which suggests that the company has been able to adapt to changing consumer preferences and maintain its market share.

The UK economy has been facing challenges, including high inflation, a strong pound, and a slowdown in consumer spending. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the UK economy has been growing, albeit at a slow pace.

PepsiCo has been investing heavily in its beverage business, and the company has reported steady growth in North American demand in recent years. However, the demand for beverages has been affected by changing consumer preferences, such as the rise of low- and no-calorie drinks and the increasing popularity of plant-based beverages.

This involves the Illinois General Assembly passing a resolution to put the question to a vote. While the current political climate in Illinois can be unpredictable, the state's Democratic-controlled legislature has shown a willingness to engage with healthcare reform. 4.

Additionally, the housing market's performance and consumer confidence can also impact mortgage demand and rates. Considering these factors, it's possible that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage could exceed 7.0% by August 2024, especially if the economy experiences a slowdown or inflation remains high. However, it's also possible that the rate might not exceed 7.0% if the economic conditions improve or the Federal Reserve decides to pause or reverse its rate hikes.

Secondly, the state has a strong focus on supporting workers' rights, which suggests that it may be less likely to reduce the minimum wage. However, there is always a possibility that the state may decide to reduce the minimum wage due to economic or other considerations.

Given this trend, it's possible that the state may maintain the $15 per hour minimum wage for fast food workers as a way to support low-wage workers. However, the state may also consider reducing the minimum wage for fast food workers to $14.25 per hour as proposed by the federal government.

To answer this, I'll consider the current trends and the likelihood of such an event occurring. Firstly, the use of AI in spreading misinformation has been a growing concern in recent years, with various platforms and algorithms being used to disseminate false information. The increasing reliance on social media and online platforms for news and information has made it easier for misinformation to spread quickly. Secondly, the 2024 election season is approaching, and it's likely that election officials, government authorities, and reputable news organizations will be closely monitoring the spread of misinformation. They will likely be on the lookout for new AI platforms that could be used to spread false information. Thirdly, the fact that the question specifies reports or warnings from credible sources, such as state or federal election officials, major news outlets, or peer-reviewed studies, suggests that the question is looking for a relatively high level of evidence. This increases the likelihood that the reports or warnings would be based on actual evidence and not just speculation or rumors. However, it's also worth considering that the emergence of new AI platforms is a rapidly evolving field, and it's possible that new platforms could be developed and deployed in a way that avoids detection by these credible sources. Additionally, the complexity of AI systems makes it challenging to identify and attribute the source of misinformation. Considering these factors, I would estimate that the probability of a new AI platform being reported for spreading election misinformation by August 2024 is relatively low, but not negligible. The development and deployment of new AI platforms is a rapidly evolving field, and it's possible that new platforms could be developed and used to spread misinformation in ways that are not yet anticipated."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "db0fdf2c-174d-42af-8441-a95c4496374d", "title": "Will Bloomberg Philanthropies announce a $600 million donation to Hispanic-serving universities by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, Bloomberg Philanthropies officially announces a donation of $600 million to the endowments of Hispanic-serving universities.

For condition (a), the spread of election misinformation through AI platforms has been a growing concern in recent years. There have been several instances of AI-generated content being used to spread misinformation during elections. However, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether a new AI platform will be used for this purpose.

Firstly, I'll look at the current economic indicators, such as GDP growth rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate. According to recent data, South Korea's economy has been experiencing a slowdown, with a GDP growth rate of around 2.5% in 2023, which is lower than the 3.5% growth rate in 2022. However, this slowdown is largely attributed to external factors, such as the global economic downturn and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, I'll consider the government's economic policies and initiatives aimed at stimulating growth. The South Korean government has implemented various measures, such as tax cuts, infrastructure investments, and support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These policies are expected to help boost economic growth and mitigate the impact of external shocks. I'll also examine the country's trade relationships and the impact of global events on its economy. South Korea is heavily reliant on exports, particularly in the electronics and automotive sectors. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had a significant impact on South Korea's exports. However, the government has been actively engaging in trade negotiations and diversifying its export markets to reduce dependence on a few key trading partners. In addition, I'll consider the country's fiscal and monetary policy responses to the economic slowdown. The South Korean government has been implementing fiscal stimulus packages to support economic growth, while the central bank has been maintaining a accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy. Considering these factors, I believe that the South Korean economy has a reasonable chance of avoiding a recession by July 2024. While there are risks and uncertainties, the government's policies and initiatives, combined with the country's strong economic fundamentals, suggest that the economy is likely to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e1be7ebf-f9ac-49f6-9f46-e52b40b501b3", "title": "Will the WHO declare the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria no longer a global emergency by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declares that the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria is no longer considered a global emergency.

Firstly, regarding the South Korean economy, I'll consider the current economic trends and forecasts.

First, let's consider condition (a). Hyundai's quarterly net income has been increasing over the past few years, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 10-15%. However, the global automotive market is highly volatile, and there are many factors that could impact Hyundai's net income, such as changes in consumer demand, competition, and raw material prices. Assuming that the global economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, I would estimate the probability of Hyundai's quarterly net income increasing by over 20% year-over-year as around 30-40%. This is a relatively high probability, but not extremely high, given the uncertainty surrounding the global economy. Next, let's consider condition (b). The French economy has been experiencing a slowdown in recent years, but it has not yet entered a recession. The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of France (INSEE) has been reporting a decline in GDP growth, but it has not yet reached the two consecutive quarters of negative growth that would define a recession.

The data is seasonally adjusted to account for fluctuations in sales due to seasonal factors. Historically, the US housing market has experienced fluctuations, with periods of growth and decline.

Arizona, on the other hand, has been a battleground state for abortion rights, with a Democratic governor who has taken steps to protect abortion access. Given the state's history of contentious debates on abortion, it's plausible that a referendum on enshrining protection for abortion rights could be initiated and completed by August 2024. Next, we should consider the logistical and procedural aspects of conducting referendums in both states. Missouri has a relatively straightforward process for placing initiatives on the ballot, while Arizona's process is more complex and requires a significant amount of time and resources to complete. Given these factors, it's difficult to assign a high probability to both referendums being conducted by August 2024.

The most recent recession, which started in February 2020, was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and was short-lived, lasting only 2 months. However, the economy has since recovered, and the current economic growth has been steady, albeit with some fluctuations. The current economic indicators suggest a moderate growth rate, with the GDP growth rate averaging around 2% in the first quarter of 2024. While this is a slower pace compared to the pre-pandemic levels, it is still above the threshold for a recession. Additionally, the labor market remains strong, with low unemployment rates and steady job growth. Consumer spending and business confidence also remain relatively high, which are positive indicators for economic growth. However, there are some potential risks that could lead to a recession, such as the ongoing trade tensions, the high level of government debt, and the potential for a global economic slowdown.

Firstly, regarding the NTT Group incident, there have been instances in the past where companies have made payments to hackers to erase sensitive data. However, without specific information on NTT Group's past practices or recent incidents, it's challenging to estimate the likelihood of such an event occurring. Assuming that the possibility of a hack and subsequent payment is not negligible, we'll consider it as a plausible event. Secondly, the U.S. economy avoiding a recession is a more complex issue. Economists have been making recession predictions for several years, and while some have pointed to potential warning signs, the U.S. economy has shown resilience. However, the economy is inherently uncertain, and the possibility of a recession cannot be ruled out entirely. Given these considerations, we can attempt to estimate the probability of both events occurring. The likelihood of NTT Group publicly confirming a payment to a hacker to erase sensitive data is difficult to quantify, but let's assume it's around 20% (a rough estimate based on the possibility of such an event occurring). The likelihood of the U.S. economy avoiding a recession is also uncertain, but let's assume it's around 50% based on the current economic trends and forecasts.

Firstly, the RBI has been maintaining a hawkish stance, keeping the repo rate relatively high to control inflation. However, with the global economic slowdown and India's economic growth slowing down, there is a possibility that the RBI might consider a rate cut to boost economic growth. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been closely monitoring the economic situation, and a rate cut could be a possibility if inflation remains under control. Secondly, the Central Bank of Chile has been following a more dovish monetary policy, with a focus on supporting economic growth. The bank has already cut interest rates in the past to stimulate the economy, and there is a possibility that they might consider another rate cut in the coming months. However, both countries face challenges in cutting interest rates. The RBI is concerned about inflation, and the Central Bank of Chile is worried about the impact of rate cuts on the country's currency and inflation. Additionally, both central banks have to balance their monetary policies with the need to maintain financial stability. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the RBI announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024 as around 60%. This is because the RBI has been maintaining a hawkish stance, but the economic slowdown and inflation concerns might lead to a rate cut.

Next, I'll consider the recent trends and developments related to abortion rights in the United States. The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v.

Condition 1: Columbus Craft Meats issues a recall of salami products due to a listeria outbreak by August 2024. I have no information about the company's history of recalls or its manufacturing practices, so I'll rely on general statistics. According to the FDA, the average number of food recalls per year is around 1,000-2,000. However, these are often for minor issues, and the number of recalls for listeria outbreaks is much lower. Listeria outbreaks are relatively rare, but they can have significant consequences. In recent years, there have been notable listeria outbreaks in the US, such as the 2011 outbreak linked to cantaloupe and the 2015 outbreak linked to cheese. However, these outbreaks were often caused by contamination at the farm or processing level, rather than a single manufacturer like Columbus Craft Meats.

Condition 2: The FDA issues a recall for ground coriander products due to lead contamination by July 2024. Lead contamination is a significant concern in the food industry, and the FDA has issued recalls for various products over the years. However, ground coriander is not a common product, and lead contamination is often associated with other types of foods, such as spices, candies, or candies with high fat content. According to the FDA, there were 1,212 recalls in 2020, with 11 of them related to lead contamination. However, these recalls were often for imported products or specific types of food, rather than ground coriander. Considering the relatively low frequency of lead contamination recalls and the specificity of the product in question, I estimate the probability of Condition 2 occurring as around 0.03 (3%). Since the conditions are independent, I will multiply the probabilities to estimate the probability of both occurring: 0.05 (Condition 1) \u00d7 0.03 (Condition 2) = 0.0015."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For the first event, Wisconsin holding a referendum on abortion rights, I'll consider the following factors: The Wisconsin state government's history of holding referendums on contentious issues, such as abortion rights; the current political climate in Wisconsin, which may influence the likelihood of a referendum being held; and the potential for interest groups or politicians to push for a referendum on abortion rights. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of Wisconsin holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024 to be around 0.6 (60%).

For condition (a), the announcement of plans to build additional nuclear reactors beyond the current two by July 2024, I consider the following factors: The US government has been actively promoting nuclear energy in recent years, with the current administration setting a goal of building 24 new reactors by 2035. There have been ongoing efforts to develop new reactor designs and technologies, which could potentially lead to the construction of additional reactors. However, there are also challenges and uncertainties associated with building new nuclear reactors, such as regulatory hurdles, public acceptance, and funding. Given these factors, I assess the probability of condition (a) occurring as around 60%. This is because while there are valid reasons to believe that the US government might announce plans to build additional reactors, there are also significant obstacles that could prevent this from happening. For condition (b), the US Senate passing a bill to cut the Pentagon's budget by more than 20% by August 2024, I consider the following factors: The US has a long history of periodic budget cuts and reductions in military spending. There are ongoing debates and discussions about the role and size of the US military, which could lead to efforts to reduce its budget.

Secondly, I would examine the opinions and statements of key decision-makers in the Vietnamese government, such as the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development or the Minister of Industry and Trade. If these officials have publicly expressed support for eliminating export taxes, it could indicate a shift in government policy. Thirdly, I would research any recent announcements or statements from the Vietnamese government on its trade policies, particularly regarding agricultural products. If there have been any statements or announcements indicating a move to eliminate export taxes, it could be a positive sign. Lastly, I would consider the broader geopolitical context, including any recent trade agreements or negotiations that Vietnam has been involved in.

First, regarding the WHO declaration, I will consider the current global situation and the WHO's past declarations. The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing since 2020, and the WHO has made several declarations regarding its global emergency status. However, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether the WHO will declare the Middle East-specific outbreak no longer a global emergency by August 2024. The WHO's declarations are typically based on scientific evidence and assessments of the situation on the ground. If the outbreak is still active and spreading in the Middle East by August 2024, it's possible that the WHO may not declare it no longer a global emergency. Regarding Indiana's Medicaid expansion program, the enrollment numbers will depend on various factors such as the program's implementation, outreach efforts, and the number of eligible residents. While it's possible that the program may enroll over 200,000 people by July 2024, it's also possible that the enrollment numbers may not meet this threshold due to various administrative or logistical challenges.

Firstly, the United States and South Korea have a long-standing security alliance, and their cooperation on matters such as defense and trade has been robust. However, the current geopolitical landscape, including the rise of China and North Korea's nuclear ambitions, may create an environment where both countries feel the need to strengthen their bilateral cooperation. Secondly, the US and South Korea have been engaging in various joint initiatives in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and 5G networks. These collaborations have the potential to be scaled up or transformed into new forms of cooperation. Thirdly, the US and South Korea have also been working on novel trade agreements, such as the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement, which has been in place since 2012. There is a possibility that they may explore new trade agreements or joint ventures that could be considered a new form of cooperation. Lastly, the cultural exchange programs between the two countries have been strong, with various initiatives such as the Korean Studies Program at the US Department of State and the US-Korea Foundation. It is possible that they may explore innovative cultural exchange programs that could be considered a new form of cooperation. However, there are also challenges and uncertainties that could hinder the implementation of a new form of cooperation. For instance, the US and South Korea may face domestic opposition, bureaucratic hurdles, or disagreements on key issues. Considering these factors, I believe that there is a moderate likelihood of the US and South Korea implementing a new form of cooperation by July 2024.

However, there's no clear indication of the Central Bank's future policy decisions, and external factors like global economic trends could influence their decisions. Considering these factors, I'll assign a probability to each condition. For condition (1), the probability of new bankruptcy proceedings against Sam Bankman-Fried by July 2024 is around 0.3 (30%). This is a relatively low probability due to the lack of concrete evidence and the ongoing nature of his previous bankruptcy case. For condition (2), the probability of the Central Bank of Argentina's Leliq rate remaining at or above 75.00% in August 2024 is around 0.55 (55%). This is a moderate probability, considering the historical context of high Leliq rates and the potential for the Central Bank to maintain or increase the rate in response to economic conditions. Now, to estimate the probability of both conditions being met, I'll multiply the individual probabilities. This is a rough estimate, as the two conditions are not entirely independent. However, it provides a starting point for our analysis. The combined probability of both conditions being met is approximately 0.3 * 0.55 = 0.165 (16.5%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0011632575499128106, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0003877525166376035, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.04980850372872069, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Condition 1: Wisconsin removing the work requirement from its Medicaid plan by July 2024. The state of Wisconsin has been a Republican stronghold in the past, and the Republican governor, Tony Evers, has expressed support for Medicaid expansion, but not necessarily for removing the work requirement. However, there have been efforts to repeal or modify the work requirement in other states, so it's possible that Wisconsin might follow suit. The timeline is relatively short, with the deadline being July 31, 2024. This suggests that any announcement or decision would likely be made in the near future. There is no clear indication of any recent developments or momentum towards removing the work requirement in Wisconsin, which makes the likelihood of this happening within the specified timeframe uncertain. Condition 2: U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 250,000 for five consecutive weeks by August 2024. The U.S. economy has been experiencing some signs of slowing down, and there are concerns about the potential for a recession. This could lead to an increase in jobless claims. However, the U.S. labor market has been resilient, and unemployment rates have remained relatively low. It's possible that the economy might not experience a significant downturn, or that the labor market might be able to absorb any job losses without a significant increase in jobless claims. The number of jobless claims has fluctuated in the past, and it's difficult to predict with certainty whether it will exceed 250,000 for five consecutive weeks. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Condition 1 (Wisconsin removing the work requirement) as relatively low, around 0.2 (20%). This is because there is no clear momentum or indication of a decision being made in the near future. For Condition 2 (U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 250,000 for five consecutive weeks), I would estimate the probability as around 0.4 (40%). This is because while the economy is experiencing some signs of slowing down, it's still uncertain whether this will lead to a significant increase in jobless claims.

First, let's consider Missouri. There is no recent history of Missouri holding referendums on abortion rights. However, there have been efforts to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, such as the 2022 ballot initiative to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution, which failed to gather enough signatures. Given the ongoing debate and activism around abortion rights in Missouri, it's possible that a referendum could be held in the future. I estimate the probability of Missouri holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024 as 0.4 (40%). Next, let's consider Tennessee. There have been efforts to reform labor laws in Tennessee, but I couldn't find any information on a referendum being officially announced or conducted by the state. However, it's possible that a referendum could be scheduled or held in the future, especially given the current labor market trends and worker activism in the state. I estimate the probability of Tennessee holding a referendum on labor laws by August 2024 as 0.3 (30%). Since the two events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to get the combined probability of both events occurring.

For condition (a), Mario Draghi's presidency is a relatively short-term position, and his appointment as President was a surprise move. While he has been a prominent figure in European politics, there's no clear indication that he will remain in the position beyond his term. In fact, Italian politics can be quite volatile, and Draghi's presidency might be affected by various factors, such as his health, personal reasons, or changes in the Italian government. Given these uncertainties, I would assign a moderate probability to Draghi remaining in office through July 2024. For condition (b), the Central Bank of Russia has faced significant challenges in recent years, including economic sanctions, inflation, and a volatile currency market. While the Central Bank of Russia has implemented various measures to stabilize the ruble, a formal stabilization program announcement by August 2024 is uncertain. The bank might choose to delay or modify its plans, or external factors could impact its ability to implement such a program. Considering these uncertainties, I would assign a moderate probability to the Central Bank of Russia announcing a ruble stabilization program by August 2024. To estimate the probability that both conditions will occur, I'll multiply the probabilities of each condition.

This suggests that the company is capable of identifying and addressing seatbelt-related problems. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has reported on the issue, which indicates that there is a recognized problem that needs to be addressed.

The company has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly net income in the past, which suggests that a 20% increase is not guaranteed. However, Hyundai has been working to improve its financial performance, and a significant increase in net income is possible if the company executes its strategies effectively.

Firstly, regarding the implementation of a free community college plan in South Carolina, I'll consider the following factors: The current state of education policy in South Carolina: There is no clear indication that a free community college plan is being actively pursued or implemented in South Carolina. In fact, the state's current education policies seem to focus on other initiatives, such as increasing funding for K-12 education. The feasibility of implementing a free community college plan: Implementing a free community college plan would require significant changes to the state's education budget and infrastructure. This would likely be a complex and time-consuming process, especially given the state's current fiscal constraints. The likelihood of bipartisan support: Implementing a free community college plan would require bipartisan support, which is often challenging to achieve in the US.

Considering these factors, I would estimate the likelihood of South Carolina implementing a free community college plan by July 2024 as relatively low, around 20%. Next, regarding the Bank of England announcing an interest rate cut, I'll consider the following factors: The current economic conditions in the UK: The UK economy is facing significant challenges, including high inflation and a slowing economy. These conditions might lead the Bank of England to consider an interest rate cut to stimulate economic growth. The Bank of England's monetary policy decisions: The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been cautious in its interest rate decisions in recent years, but it has also shown a willingness to act in response to economic conditions. Given the current economic challenges, it's possible that the MPC might decide to cut interest rates. The likelihood of a coordinated policy response: The Bank of England might consider an interest rate cut as part of a coordinated policy response to the economic challenges facing the UK. This could involve working with other government agencies or international partners to implement a comprehensive policy package. Considering these factors, I would estimate the likelihood of the Bank of England announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024 as moderate, around 50%.

The UAW's current priorities: The UAW has been focused on negotiating contracts with the Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) and has been involved in various disputes with the companies. It's possible that the UAW may prioritize these issues over endorsing a presidential candidate. 4. The timeline: The question resolves in July 2024, which is relatively close to the 2024 presidential election. This could create pressure on the UAW to make an endorsement decision, but it may also lead to a more cautious approach to avoid alienating potential candidates or their supporters. Considering these factors, I believe that the probability of the UAW endorsing Gavin Newsom for president by July 2024 is relatively low. While Newsom's pro-labor stance could appeal to the UAW, the organization's priorities and the complexity of the endorsement decision process suggest that an endorsement is not a certainty."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d1932d13-b830-4888-9868-378bb14524ed", "title": "Will California hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, California officially conducts a statewide referendum specifically on the topic of enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution.

However, there have been recent developments that suggest California may hold a referendum on abortion rights. In 2023, a group called 'Yes on Reproductive Choice' launched a campaign to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would protect abortion rights in California. While this initiative has not been officially endorsed by the state government, it indicates that there is a grassroots movement to address the issue. Additionally, the recent US Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has created a sense of urgency among abortion rights advocates in California.

However, the university has made efforts to increase financial aid and reduce debt burdens for students in recent years. 2. Trends in medical education: Many medical schools in the United States have been exploring ways to reduce debt burdens for students, including debt forgiveness programs, income-driven repayment plans, and scholarships. However, fully covering tuition for students from lower-income families is a significant undertaking that may require substantial resources and policy changes. 3. Potential barriers: Implementing a policy to fully cover tuition for medical students from lower-income families may face several barriers, including funding constraints, administrative complexities, and potential opposition from stakeholders who may view such a policy as overly generous or unsustainable. 4.

Condition (a) requires Brown University to fully cover tuition for medical students from lower-income families by July 31, 2024. This is a specific policy change that needs to be implemented by a university. While it's possible that Brown University might consider such a policy, it's a complex decision that involves various factors, including budget, resources, and priorities. Without any prior information or evidence suggesting that the university is planning to implement such a policy, I would consider this condition uncertain. Condition (b) requires Medicare's negotiated drug prices to include insulin by August 31, 2024. This is a policy change that involves a government agency, and it's likely that there will be official announcements and confirmations from reputable sources. The Biden administration has already announced plans to negotiate lower prices for certain medications, including insulin, which suggests that this condition might be more likely to be met. However, there are still uncertainties involved in this condition, such as the specifics of the negotiated prices, the timeline for implementation, and the potential for delays or changes in the policy. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of condition (a) being met as around 0.1 (10%), as it involves a complex decision-making process and a specific policy change. The probability of condition (b) being met is higher, around 0.7 (70%), as it involves a government agency and a policy change that has already been announced. However, since both conditions need to be met for the question to resolve as YES, we need to consider the joint probability of both events occurring. This is a more complex calculation, but we can use the multiplication rule for independent events, which states that the joint probability of two events A and B is equal to the product of their individual probabilities, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). In this case, we can assume that the two conditions are independent, meaning that the outcome of one condition does not affect the other. Therefore, the joint probability of both conditions being met is: P(YES) = P(a) * P(b) = 0.1 * 0.7 = 0.07.

However, the global economic environment has changed, and there are signs of inflation rising in Japan.

First, regarding Waymo's robotaxis, it's essential to consider the progress they've made in developing and testing their autonomous vehicle technology. Waymo has been actively expanding its autonomous ride-hailing service, with Phoenix, Arizona being one of the cities where it's been operational since 2018. However, the key factor here is whether they will make their service available on Lyft's platform by August 2024. While there have been reports of partnerships and discussions between Waymo and Lyft, there is no concrete evidence of a definitive agreement or a specific timeline for integration. Given the complexity of such a partnership and the need for thorough testing, I assess the likelihood of Waymo's robotaxis being available on Lyft's service by August 2024 as around 60%. This is based on the assumption that Waymo and Lyft are likely to cooperate, given the benefits of such a partnership, but there are no guarantees. Next, looking at the Swiss National Bank's policy rate, it's essential to consider the current economic trends and the central bank's stance on monetary policy. The Swiss National Bank has been keeping its policy rate low in recent years, but it has also shown a willingness to adjust its policy in response to economic conditions. Given the current economic environment, it's plausible that the bank might raise its policy rate to combat inflation or stabilize the economy. However, predicting the exact timing and magnitude of such a move is challenging. Based on the bank's past actions and the current economic landscape, I estimate the likelihood of the policy rate being at or above 2.00% by August 2024 as around 40%. This is a relatively cautious estimate, as the bank's decisions are often influenced by a range of factors, including economic data, global events, and political considerations.

A strong economy with low unemployment and stable inflation might lead to lower jobless claims. 3. Seasonal fluctuations: I'll take into account seasonal fluctuations in jobless claims, which tend to be higher during certain times of the year (e.g., winter months). 4. Potential disruptions: I'll consider potential disruptions that could impact the labor market, such as global economic downturns, pandemics, or significant policy changes. 5. Expert opinions and forecasts: I'll look at forecasts and opinions from reputable sources, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve, and leading economists.

He has a strong base of support, particularly among the poor and working class. However, his administration has also faced criticism for its handling of the economy, and there have been concerns about corruption and cronyism. 2. Economic challenges: Mexico's economy has been facing significant challenges, including a decline in economic growth, high inflation, and a large fiscal deficit. The country's economy is heavily dependent on the United States, and the ongoing trade tensions with the US have added to its economic woes. 3. Previous attempts at economic reform: There have been previous attempts at economic reform in Mexico, but they have been met with resistance from the president and his administration. For example, in 2020, the government proposed a fiscal reform package that aimed to increase taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, but it was ultimately watered down due to opposition from the president. 4.

First, I will consider the likelihood of Ohio holding a referendum on healthcare reform. Ohio has a history of holding referendums on various issues, including healthcare. In 2011, Ohio voters approved a referendum that limited collective bargaining rights for public employees. However, the most recent information I have is from 2020, when Ohio voters rejected a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid. Given the current political climate and the fact that Ohio has a Republican-controlled legislature, it is uncertain whether a referendum on healthcare reform will be held. However, it is not impossible, as there are ongoing efforts to reform the state's Medicaid program. Next, I will consider the likelihood of Oregon holding a referendum on enshrining protection for abortion rights. Oregon has a history of supporting abortion rights, and in 2020, the state legislature passed a bill that protected abortion rights in the state. However, the question of whether a referendum will be held on this issue is uncertain. Oregon has a history of using referendums to address social issues, and it is possible that a referendum on abortion rights could be held in the future. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Ohio holding a referendum on healthcare reform by August 2024 is around 0.4 (40%). This is because while there are ongoing efforts to reform the state's Medicaid program, it is uncertain whether a referendum will be held. The probability of Oregon holding a referendum on enshrining protection for abortion rights by August 2024 is around 0.6 (60%). This is because Oregon has a history of supporting abortion rights, and it is possible that a referendum on this issue could be held in the future. Finally, I will consider the probability that both conditions will be met. Since the conditions are independent, I will multiply the probabilities of each condition being met. Therefore, the probability that both Ohio and Oregon will hold referendums on healthcare reform and abortion rights, respectively, by August 2024 is around 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24 (24%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.01308687741395742, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00436229247131914, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.16141063587655946, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, several court challenges to the law have been filed, and it's possible that a court ruling could invalidate the law. Secondly, the Mississippi state legislature could potentially repeal the law, but this would require a majority vote in both the House and Senate, which is not guaranteed. Considering these factors, the likelihood of the law being overturned by July 2024 seems relatively low, as it would require a significant shift in the legal landscape or a decisive legislative action. However, there are some potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the outcome.

For condition (a), the U.S. government has a history of establishing ethics codes for various professions, including judges. However, the process of creating and implementing a new code specifically for administrative law judges may be complex and time-consuming.

The fact that Arkansas has already enacted several abortion restrictions in the past, including a 12-week abortion ban in 2013 and a 20-week abortion ban in 2017.

Condition (a) - The United Nations Development Programme announcing new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024: The UNDP has a history of announcing funding commitments, and it's not uncommon for them to make large-scale announcements. The $400 million threshold is significant, but it's not an unusually high amount for the UNDP, which has a large budget.

Condition (b) - Germany appointing a new Chancellor by August 2024: Germany has a relatively stable government, and the likelihood of a new Chancellor being appointed depends on various factors, including the current government's performance, opposition parties, and potential coalition negotiations. The current Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been in office since 2021, and there's no clear indication that he will be replaced by August 2024. However, German politics can be unpredictable, and there's always a chance of a sudden change in government.

However, the state legislature is controlled by Republicans, who are generally more conservative on abortion issues. This makes it uncertain whether stricter regulations will be enacted. 2. Previous attempts at regulation: In 2022, a bill to restrict abortion access was introduced in the Pennsylvania legislature but did not pass. This suggests that while there is a desire to regulate abortion, it may not be possible to pass stricter laws in the near future. 3. National trends: The US Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) has led to a wave of abortion restrictions in various states. However, Pennsylvania has not yet followed suit, and it's unclear whether the state will adopt stricter regulations. 4. Lobbying and public opinion: Pro-choice groups, such as Planned Parenthood, have a strong presence in Pennsylvania, and there may be significant opposition to stricter regulations. Public opinion on abortion is also divided, which could influence the legislative process. 5. Legislative calendar: The resolution date is in July 2024, which is relatively far ahead.

Considering these factors, I think it's unlikely that Pennsylvania will enact new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers by July 2024.

These factors might lead to increased jobless claims. Yet, the U.S. economy has been adapting to these challenges, and the labor market's ability to absorb shocks has been demonstrated in the past. Considering these factors, I would argue that the probability of the U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 275,000 for two consecutive weeks by August 2024 is relatively low. This is because the U.S. economy has shown a capacity to recover and adapt to various economic downturns. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Labor has consistently reported lower unemployment rates, indicating a strong labor market. However, it is essential to consider that economic forecasts are inherently uncertain and subject to various factors, including unforeseen events, policy changes, and global economic developments. Therefore, while the probability might be low, it's not impossible, and there is a degree of uncertainty."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c7f28e96-b636-40b5-a48d-09eb2830ca2b", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Intelsat emerges from bankruptcy by July 2024 and (b) U.S. weekly jobless claims exceed 275,000 for two consecutive weeks by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if both of the following conditions are met: (a) By July 31, 2024, Intelsat officially emerges from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.

First, let's assess the likelihood of Intelsat emerging from bankruptcy by July 2024. Intelsat has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since 2022, and the process can be complex and time-consuming. However, it's not uncommon for companies to emerge from bankruptcy within a year or two, especially with a court-approved reorganization plan. Assuming a typical bankruptcy process timeline, I would estimate the probability of Intelsat emerging from bankruptcy by July 2024 as around 60-70%. This is a relatively high probability because it's a common outcome for companies in similar situations. Next, let's consider the likelihood of U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 275,000 for two consecutive weeks by August 2024. The U.S. labor market has experienced fluctuations in recent years, with periods of high unemployment during the pandemic and subsequent recoveries. While it's difficult to predict future employment trends with certainty, the current economic conditions suggest that the U.S. labor market is strong, with low unemployment rates and a tight job market. However, it's not impossible that the labor market could experience a downturn, leading to higher jobless claims. I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as around 30-40%. This is a moderate probability because it's possible but not highly likely, given the current economic conditions. Now, to calculate the combined probability of both events occurring, we need to multiply the individual probabilities. Assuming a 65% chance of Intelsat emerging from bankruptcy by July 2024 and a 35% chance of U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 275,000 for two consecutive weeks by August 2024, the combined probability would be approximately 0.65 * 0.35 = 0.2275, or 22.75%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, I'll look at Maine's 72-hour waiting period. Maine's gun safety laws are generally consistent with national trends, and there hasn't been any significant pushback against the 72-hour waiting period in recent years. In fact, Maine's governor, Janet Mills, has been a strong supporter of gun safety laws. However, there is a possibility that a new governor or legislature could be elected in the future and attempt to change the law. Next, I'll consider New Mexico's child access prevention law.

However, like Maine, there is always a risk that a future government could attempt to alter or repeal the law.

However, the country's economy has shown resilience and has been recovering since then. This suggests that there are no immediate signs of a significant downturn. Next, I'll consider the economic policies implemented by the Italian government. The government has been implementing various measures to stimulate economic growth, such as investments in infrastructure, tax cuts, and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. These policies could help mitigate the risk of a recession. I'll also consider the global economic context. The global economy is expected to experience a slowdown in 2023, but Italy's economy is closely tied to the European economy, which is expected to be less affected by the global downturn. This could help Italy's economy maintain stability. However, there are also risks that could lead to a recession.

This suggests that there is a possibility of the rate exceeding 5.5% in the future. However, I'll also consider the current economic conditions and their impact on mortgage rates. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which has led to an increase in mortgage rates. But, the pace of rate hikes has slowed down in recent months, and some experts predict that rates might stabilize or even decline in the coming months. Additionally, I'll examine the current mortgage market conditions, including the demand for mortgages, the supply of credit, and the overall economic growth. A strong economy with high demand for housing and credit could lead to higher mortgage rates, while a weak economy might lead to lower rates. Considering these factors, I believe that the probability of the average rate on a 15-year mortgage exceeding 5.5% by August 2024 is relatively high, but not extremely high. I'll assign a probability of 0.7, indicating a 70% chance that the rate will exceed 5.5% by August 2024."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "34fce089-6890-44c0-b73d-dd4ef5400982", "title": "Will the Bank of Canada announce a reduction in its key interest rate by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if the Bank of Canada publicly announces a reduction in its key interest rate by August 31, 2024.

Firstly, the Bank of Canada's interest rate decisions are typically influenced by the country's economic conditions, such as inflation, GDP growth, and employment rates. As of my knowledge cutoff, Canada's economy has been experiencing a slowdown, with inflation rates decreasing and GDP growth slowing down. This might lead the Bank of Canada to consider a rate cut to stimulate the economy. However, the Bank of Canada has been cautious in its monetary policy decisions, and a rate cut would require a significant deterioration in the economic outlook. Additionally, the Bank of Canada has been closely monitoring the impact of the global economic slowdown on Canada's economy, and any rate decision would likely be influenced by this external factor. Furthermore, the Bank of Canada has been communicating its monetary policy intentions through its forward guidance, which suggests that it is likely to maintain a neutral stance on interest rates for the foreseeable future.

Historically, mortgage rates have fluctuated based on economic indicators such as inflation, GDP growth, and monetary policy decisions. As of now, there are no strong indicators that suggest a significant increase in mortgage rates beyond 5.5%. However, the global economy is subject to various uncertainties, and a sudden change in market sentiment or policy decisions could lead to a rise in interest rates. Given the current economic climate, I would assign a moderate probability to this condition being met. Condition (b) requires the Bank of Canada to announce a reduction in its key interest rate. The Bank of Canada has been gradually increasing its key interest rate over the past few years to combat inflation. However, the current inflation rate has been decreasing, and the economy is showing signs of slowing down. This might prompt the Bank of Canada to reconsider its monetary policy and potentially reduce the interest rate. However, it's difficult to predict the exact timing and magnitude of such a move.

Firstly, let's consider Eli Lilly's decision. The company's actions are influenced by various factors, including market pressure, regulatory requirements, and public opinion. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the high cost of insulin, and many stakeholders have called for increased access to affordable insulin options. While Eli Lilly has taken steps to address this issue, such as launching a generic version of its insulin product in select markets, it is unclear whether the company will officially allow generic production of its insulin product globally. Given the complex interplay of factors involved, I would assign a moderate probability to Eli Lilly allowing generic production of its insulin product by July 2024. Let's assume a probability of 0.4 (40%) for this event. Next, let's consider the Central Bank of South Korea's decision to cut interest rates. The bank's monetary policy decisions are influenced by economic indicators, such as inflation, GDP growth, and unemployment rates. While the bank may consider cutting interest rates to stimulate economic growth, it is also mindful of the potential risks associated with low interest rates, such as inflation and asset bubbles. Based on current economic trends and the bank's past decisions, I would assign a moderate probability to the Central Bank of South Korea announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024. Let's assume a probability of 0.5 (50%) for this event. Now, let's combine the probabilities of the two events to estimate the probability of both occurring. Assuming independence between the two events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: Probability = 0.4 (Eli Lilly) \u00d7 0.5 (Central Bank of South Korea) = 0.2 (20%).
