If you think it is likely the question resolves YES, the probability should be large; if you think it is unlikely the question resolves NO, the probability should be small. I want you to first provide a detailed reasoning for your answer, and then give me the probability. Your answer should be in the format: 'Reasoning: [your reasoning here] Probability: [float between 0 and 1]'",
