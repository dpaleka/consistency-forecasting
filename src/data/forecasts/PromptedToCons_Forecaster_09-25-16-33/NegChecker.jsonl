Given his busy schedule and the fact that he hasn't shown a strong interest in attending such events recently, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.20.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. Therefore, if P is 0.20, not_P must be 0.80.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same as P. Therefore, para_P should also be 0.20.\n\n4. **Q (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a highly speculative question. Given the current state of space exploration, it seems more likely that the Moon will have a permanent population before Mars. Therefore, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.10.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is the intersection of two relatively low-probability events. Therefore, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.02.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is the union of P and Q. Using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, we get 0.20 + 0.10 - 0.02 = 0.28.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does and Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the intersection of Q and not_P. Therefore, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.08.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This conditional probability can be estimated using the formula Q_given_P = P_and_Q / P. Therefore, 0.02 / 0.20 = 0.10.\n\nThese estimates obey the given consistency rules as follows:\n\n- **neg**: P = 1 - not_P. 0.20 = 1 - 0.80, which is true.\n- **andor**: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q. 0.20 = 0.28 + 0.02 - 0.10, which is true.\n- **and**: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q). max(0.20 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.02 <= min(0.20, 0.10), which is true.\n- **or**: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q). max(0.20, 0.10) <= 0.28 <= min(1, 0.20 + 0.10), which is true.\n- **but**: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P. 0.20 = 0.28 - 0.08, which is true.\n- **cond**: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P. 0.20 \u2248 0.02 / 0.10, which is true.\n- **para**: P = para_P. 0.20 = 0.20, which is true.\n\nTherefore, all the consistency checks are passed.\n\nP: 0.20\nnot_P: 0.80\npara_P: 0.20\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.02\nP_or_Q: 0.28\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.20 = 1 - 0.80 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.20 = 0.28 + 0.02 - 0.10 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.20 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.02 <= min(0.20, 0.10) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.20, 0.10) <= 0.28 <= min(1, 0.20 + 0.10) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.20 = 0.28 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.20 \u2248 0.02 / 0.10 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.20 = 0.20 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.20\nnot_P: 0.80\npara_P: 0.20\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.02\nP_or_Q: 0.28\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.2", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"model": "gpt-4o", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T16:35:20.816018", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('e9834c66-df47-4b07-8e62-c99436489850'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('96048d65-d792-42c6-9c9f-28fd37af2c67'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('b0c40d12-c4f3-40e4-808d-8329041ab8ad'), title='Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the biggest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('31e9ccb1-485b-4d1d-b0f2-cd1f4ebe64b5'), title='Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nMars is often disussed as a target for mass colonization and eventual terraforming, notably by SpaceX.

If the probability of P is 0.60, then not_P is 1 - 0.60 = 0.40 (40% chance).\n   - Estimate: 0.40 (40% chance)\n\n3. **para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This is essentially the same as P, as the question is framed in a similar manner.\n   - Estimate: 0.60 (60% chance)\n\n4. **Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is a long-term prediction with many uncertainties, including technological advancements, political will, and funding for space colonization.\n   - Estimate: 0.20 (20% chance)\n\n5. **P_and_Q: Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, and (2) Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is the joint probability of P and Q happening together. Given the independence of these events, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12 (12% chance).\n   - Estimate: 0.12 (12% chance)\n\n6. **P_or_Q: Will either of the following occur: (a) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024? (b) Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is the probability of either P or Q happening. Using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, we get P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68 (68% chance).\n   - Estimate: 0.68 (68% chance)\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P: Will both of the following occur: (1) Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does and (2) Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This is the joint probability of Q and not_P happening together. Given the independence of these events, Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08 (8% chance).\n   - Estimate: 0.08 (8% chance)\n\n8. **Q_given_P: Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is the conditional probability of Q given P. Using the formula Q_given_P = P_and_Q / P, we get Q_given_P = 0.12 / 0.60 = 0.20 (20% chance).\n   - Estimate: 0.20 (20% chance)\n\nBy following these estimates, we ensure that the consistency rules are adhered to.

I estimate a lower probability of 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, and (2) Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: The probability of both independent events occurring is generally the product of their individual probabilities. So, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either of the following occur: (a) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024? (b) Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both of the following occur: (1) Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does and (2) Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the product of the probabilities of Q and not_P, so Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is the conditional probability of Q given P, which can be estimated as Q_given_P = P_and_Q / P = 0.13 / 0.65 = 0.20.\n\nI have ensured that all the predictions obey the given consistency rules.

He has a history of attending high-profile events, especially those related to technology and cryptocurrency.\n- **Factors Against:** His busy schedule and potential other commitments could prevent him from attending. Additionally, security or personal reasons might also play a role.\n\n**not_P: Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n\n- This is simply the complement of P. If the probability of P is high, then the probability of not_P should be low and vice versa.\n\n**para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n\n- This is essentially the same as P, given the phrasing of the question. The probabilities should be equal.\n\n**Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n\n- **Factors in Favor:** SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, has ambitious plans for Mars colonization. There is significant investment and technological advancement aimed at making Mars habitable.\n- **Factors Against:** The Moon is closer to Earth and may be easier to colonize first. Other space agencies might prioritize the Moon over Mars for permanent settlements.\n\n**P_and_Q: Will both P and Q occur?**\n\n- This is the intersection of P and Q. The probability should be lower than either P or Q individually.\n\n**P_or_Q: Will either P or Q occur?**\n\n- This is the union of P and Q. The probability should be higher than either P or Q individually.\n\n**Q_and_not_P: Will both Q and not_P occur?**\n\n- This is the intersection of Q and not_P. The probability should be lower than either Q or not_P individually.\n\n**Q_given_P: Given P, will Q occur?**\n\n- This is the conditional probability of Q given P. It should be consistent with the intersection and individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n### Consistency Rules ###\n\n- **neg:** P = 1 - not_P\n- **andor:** P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q\n- **and:** max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)\n- **or:** max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)\n- **but:** P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P\n- **cond:** P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P\n- **para:** P = para_P\n\n### Independence and Relationships ###\n\n- P and Q are likely independent events. Elon Musk's attendance at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 is not directly related to the colonization efforts on Mars or the Moon.\n- The probabilities should reflect their independence, except for conditional probabilities like Q_given_P, which should be calculated accordingly.\n\n\nP: 0.40\nnot_P: 0.60\npara_P: 0.40\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.08\nP_or_Q: 0.52\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.52 + 0.08 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.08 <= min(0.40, 0.20) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.20) <= 0.52 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.52 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.08 / 0.20 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.40\nnot_P: 0.60\npara_P: 0.40\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.08\nP_or_Q: 0.52\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "fcbabe15-5125-49be-a55c-0f008e88035f", "title": "At the Paris Summer Olympics in 2024, will the men's 100m dash winning time not break the Olympic record of 9.63s?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if no athlete runs the Men's 100M race at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics in less than 9.63s, according to results posted by the [International Olympic Committee](https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/olympic-results) or credible sources.

The key events are Elon Musk's attendance at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (P) and Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does (Q). Here are the detailed thoughts and reasoning for each probability estimate and their relationships.\n\n1. **P: Will Elon Musk show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - Considering Elon Musk's involvement in the crypto space and his unpredictability, there is a moderate chance he might attend. Let's estimate this at 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P: Will Elon Musk not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P should be 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This question is essentially the same as P, so para_P should be equal to P, which is 0.60.\n\n4. **Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - Given the technological and logistical challenges, this is a long-term event with a lower probability. Let's estimate this at 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q: Will both Elon Musk attend Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon?**\n   - This is the intersection of P and Q. Since P and Q are independent events, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12.\n\n6. **P_or_Q: Will either Elon Musk attend Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon?**\n   - This is the union of P and Q. Using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, we get P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon and Elon Musk not attend Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This is the intersection of Q and not_P. Since Q and not_P are independent events, Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08.\n\n8. **Q_given_P: Given Elon Musk shows up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon?**\n   - This is a conditional probability. Since P and Q are independent, Q_given_P = Q = 0.20.\n\n### Consistency Checks\n\n1. **neg: P = 1 - not_P**\n   - 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\n\n2. **andor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q**\n   - 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\n\n3. **and: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)**\n   - max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is TRUE\n\n4. **or: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)**\n   - max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\n\n5. **but: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P**\n   - 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\n\n6. **cond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P**\n   - 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.20 is TRUE\n\n7. **para: P = para_P**\n   - 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nIn summary, all the consistency checks pass with these probability estimates.

The questions revolve around two main events: Elon Musk's attendance at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 conference and the establishment of a permanent population of 10,000 on Mars before the Moon achieves the same milestone. Here is my reasoning process for each probability estimate and the consistency rules that must be followed:\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Given the prominence of Elon Musk in the cryptocurrency space and his previous appearances at similar events, I estimate a relatively high probability for P.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This must be the complement of P, so not_P = 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is essentially the same as P, so para_P = P.\n\n4. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This is a long-term event with many uncertainties. Given the current state of space exploration, a moderate probability can be assigned.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Elon Musk attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This is the intersection of two events. Since these events are relatively independent, P_and_Q can be estimated as the product of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Elon Musk attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This is the union of two events. The probability of P_or_Q can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon and Elon Musk not attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the intersection of Q and not_P. Since these events are relatively independent, Q_and_not_P can be estimated as the product of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon given that Elon Musk attends Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This conditional probability can be estimated based on the relationship between P_and_Q and P, Q_given_P = P_and_Q / P.\n\nLet's now make the probability estimates while ensuring they obey the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.13\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.13\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "65da20ac-c384-4223-a73a-c55009b79efe", "title": "Will Doug Burgum not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Doug Burgum is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

If the probability of Musk attending is 0.60, then the probability of him not attending is 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This is essentially the same question as P, so the probability should be identical. Thus, para_P = 0.60.\n\n4. **Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - Given the current pace of space exploration and colonization efforts, establishing a permanent population of 10,000 on Mars before the Moon is highly speculative. I estimate a probability of 0.10 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q: Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, and (2) Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - For both events to occur, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening independently: 0.60 * 0.10 = 0.06.\n\n6. **P_or_Q: Will either of the following occur: (a) Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, or (b) Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - Using the formula for the probability of either event occurring: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.60 + 0.10 - 0.06 = 0.64.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P: Will both of the following occur: (1) Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does, and (2) Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - For both events to occur, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening independently: 0.10 * 0.40 = 0.04.\n\n8. **Q_given_P: Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This conditional probability is calculated as P_and_Q / P = 0.06 / 0.60 = 0.10.\n\nAll these predictions obey the given consistency rules.

Given that P and Q are largely independent, the conditional probability is the same as the marginal probability of Q.\n   - Estimated Probability: 0.10\n\n### Consistency Checks\n- **neg**: P = 1 - not_P, 0.50 = 1 - 0.50 is TRUE\n- **andor**: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.50 = 0.55 + 0.05 - 0.10 is TRUE\n- **and**: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.50 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.05 <= min(0.50, 0.10) is TRUE\n- **or**: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.50, 0.10) <= 0.55 <= min(1, 0.50 + 0.10) is TRUE\n- **but**: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.50 = 0.55 - 0.05 is TRUE\n- **cond**: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.50 \u2248 0.05 / 0.10 is TRUE\n- **para**: P = para_P, 0.50 = 0.50 is TRUE\n\nAll consistency checks are passed.\n\nP: 0.50\nnot_P: 0.50\npara_P: 0.50\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.05\nP_or_Q: 0.55\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.50 = 1 - 0.50 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.50 = 0.55 + 0.05 - 0.10 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.50 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.05 <= min(0.50, 0.10) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.50, 0.10) <= 0.55 <= min(1, 0.50 + 0.10) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.50 = 0.55 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.50 \u2248 0.05 / 0.10 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.50 = 0.50 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.50\nnot_P: 0.50\npara_P: 0.50\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.05\nP_or_Q: 0.55\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.5", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.010153423432867514, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.005076711716433757, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.14271159300492764, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
