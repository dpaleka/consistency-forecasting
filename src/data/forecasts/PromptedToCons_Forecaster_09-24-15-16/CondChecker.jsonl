His presence would likely depend on various factors such as his schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the conference. I would assign a probability of around 0.65 to this event.\n\n**not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. Given my estimate for P, I would assign a probability of 0.35 for not_P.\n\n**para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I would assign it the same probability, 0.65.\n\n**Q (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a much more speculative question. Given the complexities of space colonization, I would estimate a lower probability of 0.20 for this event, considering the current technological and logistical challenges.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both events occur?)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring would be lower than either occurring individually. I would estimate this at 0.13, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both events happening simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either event occur?)**: This probability would be higher than either P or Q alone. I would estimate this at around 0.72, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does, and Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a conditional scenario, and I would assign a low probability of 0.05, as it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty of not_P.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a conditional probability that would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's presence could potentially influence interest and investment in Mars colonization. I would estimate this at 0.25.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the events are interrelated, particularly the relationship between Musk's attendance and the interest in Mars colonization. However, the events are still distinct enough to warrant individual probability assessments.

His presence would likely depend on various factors such as his schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the conference. I would assign a probability of around 0.65 to this event.\n\n**not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. Given my estimate for P, I would assign a probability of 0.35 for not_P.\n\n**para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I would assign it the same probability, 0.65.\n\n**Q (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a much more speculative question. Given the complexities of space colonization, I would estimate a lower probability of 0.20 for this event, considering the current technological and logistical challenges.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both events occur?)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring would be lower than either occurring individually. I would estimate this at 0.13, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both events happening simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either event occur?)**: This probability would be higher than either P or Q alone. I would estimate this at around 0.72, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does, and Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a conditional scenario, and I would assign a low probability of 0.05, as it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty of not_P.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a conditional probability that would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's presence could potentially influence interest and investment in Mars colonization. I would estimate this at 0.25.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the events are interrelated, particularly the relationship between Musk's attendance and the interest in Mars colonization. However, the events are still distinct enough to warrant individual probability assessments. I will now provide the probability estimates based on this reasoning.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c183fd7c-acbc-4998-9fe9-3d2b1e75ade9", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?

His presence would likely depend on various factors such as his schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the conference. I would assign a probability of around 0.65 to this event.\n\n**not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. Given my estimate for P, I would assign a probability of 0.35 for not_P.\n\n**para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I would assign it the same probability, 0.65.\n\n**Q (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a much more speculative question. Given the complexities of space colonization, I would estimate a lower probability of 0.20 for this event, considering the current technological and logistical challenges.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both events occur?)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring would be lower than either occurring individually. I would estimate this at 0.13, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both events happening simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either event occur?)**: This probability would be higher than either P or Q alone. I would estimate this at around 0.72, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does, and Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a conditional scenario, and I would assign a low probability of 0.05, as it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty of not_P.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a conditional probability that would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's presence could potentially influence interest and investment in Mars colonization. I would estimate this at 0.25.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the events are interrelated, particularly the relationship between Musk's attendance and the interest in Mars colonization. However, the events are still distinct enough to warrant individual probability assessments. I will now provide the probability estimates based on this reasoning.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}}

His presence would likely depend on various factors such as his schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the conference. I would assign a probability of around 0.65 to this event.\n\n**not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. Given my estimate for P, I would assign a probability of 0.35 for not_P.\n\n**para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I would assign it the same probability, 0.65.\n\n**Q (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a much more speculative question. Given the complexities of space colonization, I would estimate a lower probability of 0.20 for this event, considering the current technological and logistical challenges.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both events occur?)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring would be lower than either occurring individually. I would estimate this at 0.13, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both events happening simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either event occur?)**: This probability would be higher than either P or Q alone. I would estimate this at around 0.72, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does, and Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a conditional scenario, and I would assign a low probability of 0.05, as it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty of not_P.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a conditional probability that would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's presence could potentially influence interest and investment in Mars colonization. I would estimate this at 0.25.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the events are interrelated, particularly the relationship between Musk's attendance and the interest in Mars colonization. However, the events are still distinct enough to warrant individual probability assessments. I will now provide the probability estimates based on this reasoning.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "255faa5e-074d-48bc-b577-e0569a0649f4", "title": "Given Donald Trump is removed or blocked from a primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, will he be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, as of July 15, 2024.

His presence would likely depend on various factors such as his schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the conference. I would assign a probability of around 0.65 to this event.\n\n**not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. Given my estimate for P, I would assign a probability of 0.35 for not_P.\n\n**para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I would assign it the same probability, 0.65.\n\n**Q (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a much more speculative question. Given the complexities of space colonization, I would estimate a lower probability of 0.20 for this event, considering the current technological and logistical challenges.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both events occur?)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring would be lower than either occurring individually. I would estimate this at 0.13, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both events happening simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either event occur?)**: This probability would be higher than either P or Q alone. I would estimate this at around 0.72, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does, and Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a conditional scenario, and I would assign a low probability of 0.05, as it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty of not_P.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a conditional probability that would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's presence could potentially influence interest and investment in Mars colonization. I would estimate this at 0.25.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the events are interrelated, particularly the relationship between Musk's attendance and the interest in Mars colonization. However, the events are still distinct enough to warrant individual probability assessments. I will now provide the probability estimates based on this reasoning.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "4ca6af27-3444-456a-a3dc-869877bc499a", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, and (2) Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

His presence would likely depend on various factors such as his schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the conference. I would assign a probability of around 0.65 to this event.\n\n**not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. Given my estimate for P, I would assign a probability of 0.35 for not_P.\n\n**para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I would assign it the same probability, 0.65.\n\n**Q (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a much more speculative question. Given the complexities of space colonization, I would estimate a lower probability of 0.20 for this event, considering the current technological and logistical challenges.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both events occur?)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring would be lower than either occurring individually. I would estimate this at 0.13, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both events happening simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either event occur?)**: This probability would be higher than either P or Q alone. I would estimate this at around 0.72, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does, and Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a conditional scenario, and I would assign a low probability of 0.05, as it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty of not_P.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a conditional probability that would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's presence could potentially influence interest and investment in Mars colonization. I would estimate this at 0.25.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the events are interrelated, particularly the relationship between Musk's attendance and the interest in Mars colonization. However, the events are still distinct enough to warrant individual probability assessments. I will now provide the probability estimates based on this reasoning.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}}
