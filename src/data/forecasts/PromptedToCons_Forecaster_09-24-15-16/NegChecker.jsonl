I estimate this at 0.26, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability must account for the overlap between P and Q. I estimate this at 0.70, indicating a reasonably high likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon, and Musk does not show up)**: This is a more specific scenario and is estimated at 0.15, reflecting the lower likelihood of both conditions being met simultaneously.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will Mars have a population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: I estimate this conditional probability at 0.45, indicating that Musk's attendance could have a positive influence on the perception of Mars colonization.\n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n- The events P and Q are not independent; Musk's attendance may influence public interest and investment in space colonization, potentially impacting the timelines for Mars and the Moon.\n- The relationship between the events is crucial for understanding the probabilities, as they are interlinked through Musk's influence in both the Bitcoin and space exploration sectors.\n\n### Consistency with Rules:\nAll probability estimates will be checked against the consistency rules provided to ensure they adhere to the logical relationships defined. Adjustments may be necessary to ensure that all rules are satisfied.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 ... consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.24,\nP_or_Q: 0.76,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-24T15:17:06.707315", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('47786c6f-fdfc-4a80-a6f3-84cef23f61e4'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('a8fc9217-bc0f-42bf-8b54-209d3a2a5284'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('3f1f5b71-54dd-4939-a25a-7653fa75077f'), title='Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, a prominent Bitcoin conference scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('a478e2d8-48bf-4641-b31e-4aef9de06461'), title='Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nMars is often disussed as a target for mass colonization and eventual terraforming, notably by SpaceX.

Factors influencing this include the significance of the conference and Musk's known interest in cryptocurrency. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is reasonably high, not_P will be lower, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Musk's commitments. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is closely related to P and should reflect a similar probability since they are fundamentally asking the same question in slightly different wording. \n\n4. **Q (Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does)**: This is a more speculative question. Given the current state of space exploration and colonization efforts, particularly by SpaceX, I assess a lower probability for this event compared to Musk's attendance at the conference. Factors include technological challenges and the long time frame involved. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Musk attends and Mars has a population of 10,000)**: The probability of both events happening is likely lower than either event occurring individually, as they are independent events. However, if Musk's involvement in space exploration increases, it could slightly raise this probability. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Musk shows up or Mars has a population of 10,000)**: This probability should be higher than both individual probabilities since it covers either occurrence. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars has a population of 10,000 before the Moon, and Musk does not attend)**: This is a more complex relationship, as it combines the outcomes of two independent events, one of which is the complement of the other. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (If Musk shows up, will Mars have a population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This conditional probability might suggest that if Musk attends, there could be a greater focus on Mars colonization efforts, potentially increasing the likelihood of Q. \n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are guided by their independence or dependence on one another. The estimates must adhere to the consistency rules, ensuring that the probabilities reflect logical outcomes based on the relationships among the events.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}}

Factors include his public persona, past appearances at similar events, and the growing interest in Bitcoin. I estimate this probability at 0.65.\n\n**not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: \nThis is simply the complement of P, which would be 1 - P. Thus, I estimate this at 0.35.\n\n**para_P (Chance of Elon Musk attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: \nThis is essentially the same as P, as both questions are asking about the same event. I will keep this estimate at 0.65.\n\n**Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: \nConsidering the advancements in space exploration and Musk's ambitions with SpaceX, I estimate a lower probability for this event occurring before the Moon reaches the same milestone. The factors include technological challenges, funding, and potential colonization timelines. I estimate this at 0.30.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: \nThis is a joint probability and will depend on the individual probabilities of P and Q. Since both events are somewhat independent, I estimate this at P * Q = 0.65 * 0.30 = 0.195.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: \nThis probability can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, I estimate this at 0.65 + 0.30 - 0.195 = 0.755.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Mars having a population before the Moon and Musk not showing up)**: \nThis probability involves the intersection of Q and not_P. I estimate this at Q * not_P = 0.30 * 0.35 = 0.105.\n\n**Q_given_P (Mars having a population before the Moon given Musk shows up)**: \nThis conditional probability might be slightly higher if Musk shows up, as it could indicate increased interest in space exploration. I will estimate this at 0.35.\n\nIn summary, the estimates for P, not_P, para_P, Q, P_and_Q, P_or_Q, Q_and_not_P, and Q_given_P are interrelated and reflect both the independence of the events and their potential outcomes based on current knowledge and trends.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.195,\nP_or_Q: 0.755,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105,\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.755 + 0.195 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.195 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.755 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.755 - 0.105 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.195 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "952c295b-bf5e-4aeb-8cb7-5b6c5ccab7d0", "title": "Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T05:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-24T15:17:06.527295", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('47786c6f-fdfc-4a80-a6f3-84cef23f61e4'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('a8fc9217-bc0f-42bf-8b54-209d3a2a5284'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('3f1f5b71-54dd-4939-a25a-7653fa75077f'), title='Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, a prominent Bitcoin conference scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('a478e2d8-48bf-4641-b31e-4aef9de06461'), title='Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nMars is often disussed as a target for mass colonization and eventual terraforming, notably by SpaceX.

His presence would likely depend on various factors such as his schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the conference. I would assign a probability of around 0.65 to this event.\n\n**not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. Given my estimate for P, I would assign a probability of 0.35 for not_P.\n\n**para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I would assign it the same probability, 0.65.\n\n**Q (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a much more speculative question. Given the complexities of space colonization, I would estimate a lower probability of 0.20 for this event, considering the current technological and logistical challenges.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both events occur?)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring would be lower than either occurring individually. I would estimate this at 0.13, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both events happening simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either event occur?)**: This probability would be higher than either P or Q alone. I would estimate this at around 0.72, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does, and Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a conditional scenario, and I would assign a low probability of 0.05, as it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty of not_P.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**: This is a conditional probability that would likely be higher than Q alone, as Musk's presence could potentially influence interest and investment in Mars colonization. I would estimate this at 0.25.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the events are interrelated, particularly the relationship between Musk's attendance and the interest in Mars colonization. However, the events are still distinct enough to warrant individual probability assessments. I will now provide the probability estimates based on this reasoning.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}}
