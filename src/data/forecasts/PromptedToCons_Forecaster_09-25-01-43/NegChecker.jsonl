This is based on OpenAI's previous transparency efforts and the increasing demand for accountability in AI safety. However, the timeline is tight, which introduces some uncertainty.\n\n**not_P: Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?**\nGiven the estimate for P, not_P is consequently 0.35. This reflects the possibility that OpenAI may choose not to publish such results, either due to strategic reasons or delays.\n\n**para_P: Is OpenAI going to release a public report detailing the findings from an external red-team evaluation of their models' safety before June 30, 2024?**\nThis is directly related to P, so I assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n**Q: Will the US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?**\nI estimate this probability at 0.20. The historical context of nuclear testing and international scrutiny makes it less likely, but geopolitical tensions could influence this outcome.\n\n**P_and_Q: Will both of the following occur: (1) OpenAI publishes a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, and (2) the US conducts a nuclear test explosion before 2030?**\nThe joint occurrence of these events is less likely, so I estimate this at 0.10. This reflects the low probability of both events happening simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q: Will either of the following occur: (a) OpenAI publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024? (b) The US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?**\nGiven the individual probabilities, I estimate this at 0.70. This reflects the likelihood that at least one of these events will happen.\n\n**Q_and_not_P: Will both of the following occur: (1) The US conducts a nuclear test explosion before 2030, and (2) OpenAI does not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?**\nThis is a complex question, and I estimate this at 0.05, reflecting the low likelihood of both conditions being satisfied.\n\n**Q_given_P: Given OpenAI publishes a report with results from external red-teaming, will the US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?**\nI estimate this at 0.15, as the publication of the report could have implications for US policy and behavior, though the connection is indirect.\n\nOverall, I considered the relationships between these events, particularly how the occurrence of one might influence the likelihood of another. I ensured that my estimates adhered to the consistency rules, particularly regarding the relationships between P, not_P, and the various joint and conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.10 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.10 / 0.15 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T01:45:25.318691", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('a52cc836-9d39-4678-b163-2c5d8afd97df'), title='Will OpenAI publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('f1f67c52-81aa-446f-985f-e0981b222042'), title='Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('113dfd9d-29fd-4f90-b1f8-4e61348a1166'), title=\"Is OpenAI going to release a public report detailing the findings from an external red-team evaluation of their models' safety before June 30, 2024?\", body='This question will be considered **YES** if OpenAI releases a *public* report by June 30, 2024, that presents the results from an *external* assessment of the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('e3bed537-2120-4160-a48e-ea0a40e31331'), title='Will the US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively to verification of a nuclear explosion by the CTBTO, the UN, or if an official government statement from the US is issued confirming the test.

Given these factors, I estimate this probability to be relatively high.\n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I predict P to be high, then not_P will be correspondingly low.\n\n3. **para_P (Public report on external red-team evaluation)**: This is closely related to P, as it essentially asks the same question but emphasizes the external evaluation aspect. Since both events are linked, I expect para_P to have a similar probability to P.\n\n4. **Q (US conducts a nuclear test explosion before 2030)**: The probability of the US conducting a nuclear test is influenced by geopolitical factors, treaties, and current international relations. Given the current climate, I estimate this probability to be moderate.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This requires both P and Q to happen. The probability will be lower than either P or Q alone due to the conjunction of two independent events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q alone, as it includes the possibility of either event occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Nuclear test occurs, but OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This event requires Q to happen while not P occurs. It might have a moderate probability since it combines a geopolitical event with a corporate action.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given OpenAI publishes a report, will the US conduct a nuclear test?)**: This conditional probability will depend on the relationship between the two events. If I believe that the publication of the report might influence geopolitical decisions, this probability might be higher than Q alone.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that the probabilities align with the consistency rules, reflecting the logical relationships between the events.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.69,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.69 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.69 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.69 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_3, failed_check_6 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.69,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06471682202218454, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03235841101109227, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.36524578353570125, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given the importance of transparency in AI safety, I estimate a moderate probability that this will happen, say around 0.65. This is based on the trend of increasing accountability in AI development.\n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This is the complement of P. Since probabilities must sum to 1, I will set not_P = 1 - P, which gives us a value of 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (OpenAI releases a public report)**: This is similar to P, so I can set this equal to P, giving para_P = 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (US conducts a nuclear test explosion)**: This is a more uncertain event, especially considering international scrutiny and treaties against nuclear testing. I would assign a lower probability, perhaps around 0.20, reflecting the current geopolitical climate.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability depends on the conjunction of P and Q. Since both events are somewhat independent, I can use the product of their probabilities here. I estimate this at P * Q = 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: For this, I will use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. This gives us a value of 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This is a conditional event that requires both Q to happen and not P. I can estimate this as Q * not_P, which gives us 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This is a conditional probability and can be estimated using P_and_Q / P. If I assume P is true, the likelihood of Q might increase slightly, but I will keep it at the original estimate for simplicity. Therefore, I can set this as Q / P = 0.20 / 0.65 = 0.31.\n\nAfter making these estimates, I will check them against the consistency rules to ensure they abide by the mathematical relationships established.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.31\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.31 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.31\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "952c295b-bf5e-4aeb-8cb7-5b6c5ccab7d0", "title": "Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T05:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T01:45:29.468026", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('a52cc836-9d39-4678-b163-2c5d8afd97df'), title='Will OpenAI publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('f1f67c52-81aa-446f-985f-e0981b222042'), title='Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('113dfd9d-29fd-4f90-b1f8-4e61348a1166'), title=\"Is OpenAI going to release a public report detailing the findings from an external red-team evaluation of their models' safety before June 30, 2024?\", body='This question will be considered **YES** if OpenAI releases a *public* report by June 30, 2024, that presents the results from an *external* assessment of the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('e3bed537-2120-4160-a48e-ea0a40e31331'), title='Will the US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively to verification of a nuclear explosion by the CTBTO, the UN, or if an official government statement from the US is issued confirming the test.

Given the current trend in AI safety and transparency, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for this event happening. \n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI does not publish a report)**: Since this is the complement of event P, I calculate this as 1 - P, which gives a probability of 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (OpenAI releases a public report)**: This is essentially synonymous with P, so I assign the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (US conducts a nuclear test)**: This event is more uncertain due to geopolitical factors. I estimate a lower probability of 0.25 for this event, considering the current global stance on nuclear testing and treaties.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events happening together is influenced by their independence. Since the likelihood of OpenAI publishing a report is somewhat independent of whether the US conducts a nuclear test, I estimate this joint probability to be P * Q = 0.65 * 0.25 = 0.1625, rounded to 0.16.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one of the events occurs)**: To calculate this, I use the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.74.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducts a nuclear test and OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This event can be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.25 * 0.35 = 0.0875, rounded to 0.09.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (If OpenAI publishes a report, will the US conduct a nuclear test?)**: This is a conditional probability. Given that P has occurred, I assume the probability of Q might slightly increase due to potential geopolitical tensions, so I set this to 0.30.\n\nOverall, I ensure that these estimates obey the consistency rules by checking each relationship and confirming that the calculations are coherent with the defined probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.74 + 0.16 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.16 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.74 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.16 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09431067947124139, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047155339735620694, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44426165831931935, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
