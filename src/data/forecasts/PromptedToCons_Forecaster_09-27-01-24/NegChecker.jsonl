Given Musk's history with Bitcoin and similar events, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for this happening.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, hence it should be 1 - P, resulting in 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is essentially the same as P, so it should have the same probability. Thus, I estimate it at 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024?)**: Musk is known for making announcements, but the timing and context are unpredictable. I estimate a probability of 0.50 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The joint probability of both events happening can be estimated using the multiplication rule for independent events. Assuming P and Q are independent, I would estimate this at P * Q = 0.65 * 0.50 = 0.325.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. Hence, it would be 0.65 + 0.50 - 0.325 = 0.825.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This requires the probability of Q occurring while P does not. Assuming independence, this can be expressed as Q * not_P = 0.50 * 0.35 = 0.175.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability can be estimated as P_and_Q / P = 0.325 / 0.65 = 0.5.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities are interrelated, and I will ensure that they follow the consistency rules while estimating. The independence assumption between P and Q might not hold perfectly in reality, but for the sake of this estimation, I will proceed with it.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.325,\nP_or_Q: 0.825,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.175,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.825 + 0.325 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.325 <= min(0.65, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.50) <= 0.825 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.825 - 0.175 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.325 / 0.50 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_3 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.325,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.175,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-27T01:24:58.341643", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('25aa6a58-5a0c-4485-b451-328e79c57bb7'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('bdff4197-e778-42f2-8cfd-04e5d48fce99'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('e1a77fcf-b097-4a29-aa4f-1a2b94d34b72'), title='Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences and is scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('8f92ad1b-b930-4900-8071-f1ba7e90e4e6'), title='Will Elon Musk make a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024?', body='This question will resolve YES if Elon Musk publicly announces a significant initiative or project related to Bitcoin at any event or platform in 2024.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_and_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('42401fb1-0532-4735-a026-e06cff1ca5a5'), title='Will both of the following occur: (1) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?

Given his history with Bitcoin, I would estimate a moderate probability of around 0.60 for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P, and given the estimated probability of P, I would assign a probability of 0.40 to not_P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: This is similar to P and is likely to have the same probability, so I would also estimate this at 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024)**: This depends on various factors, including market conditions and Musk's engagement with Bitcoin. Given the uncertainty around such announcements, I would estimate a lower probability of around 0.50.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This is the joint occurrence of P and Q. I would estimate this probability as the product of the individual probabilities, giving about 0.30.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This would be the sum of the probabilities of P and Q minus the probability of both occurring.

However, since the event is still in the future and there are many variables that could affect his decision, I will assign a probability of 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P to be 0.65, then not_P will be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Elon Musk attending)**: Since para_P is essentially the same as P, I will assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024)**: Given the ongoing developments in the Bitcoin space and Musk's influence, I believe there is a reasonable chance he might make a significant announcement. I will assign a probability of 0.60.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: Since both events are independent but related, I will calculate this as the product of their individual probabilities. Thus, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.65 * 0.60 = 0.39.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This is calculated using the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.60 - 0.39 = 0.86.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This can be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.60 * 0.35 = 0.21.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given that P occurs)**: This is a conditional probability and can be estimated as Q / P = 0.60 / 0.65 = 0.92.\n\nOverall, the relationships among these variables are consistent, as P and not_P are complements, and the calculations for P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and Q_and_not_P follow the established rules of probability.

However, since there are many variables at play (such as his schedule and interests at that time), I will assign a probability of 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 1 - P = 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is similar to P, so I will assign a probability of 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024?)**: Given the volatility and interest in Bitcoin, I believe there's a decent chance he may make an announcement, so I will assign this a probability of 0.50.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: I will estimate this by considering the joint probability, which will be lower than either P or Q due to their independence. I estimate this to be 0.30.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This will be calculated using the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, I will calculate this to be 0.65 + 0.50 - 0.30 = 0.85.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This will be lower than Q, as it requires Q to happen while P does not. I estimate this to be 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This will be a conditional probability and I estimate it to be higher than Q alone, so I will set it at 0.60.\n\nAfter estimating these probabilities, I will check them against the consistency rules to ensure they adhere to the mathematical relationships defined.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.65, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.50) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.30 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "fcbabe15-5125-49be-a55c-0f008e88035f", "title": "At the Paris Summer Olympics in 2024, will the men's 100m dash winning time not break the Olympic record of 9.63s?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if no athlete runs the Men's 100M race at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics in less than 9.63s, according to results posted by the [International Olympic Committee](https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/olympic-results) or credible sources.

If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a possibility that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P, and I will assign it the same probability of 0.60, as it directly relates to his attendance.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024?)**: Given the unpredictability of announcements, I would estimate this at around 0.50 based on his history of making unexpected statements.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability can be estimated by considering the independent probabilities of P and Q. Assuming P and Q are independent, P_and_Q would be P * Q = 0.60 * 0.50 = 0.30.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.50 - 0.30 = 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This can be estimated as Q * not_P = 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability can be estimated based on the assumption that if Elon Musk shows up, the likelihood of him making an announcement increases. I would estimate this at around 0.70.\n\nAfter calculating these probabilities, I will ensure that they adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.50) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.70 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06471682202218476, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03235841101109238, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.36524578353570125, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his past involvement in similar events, I would estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.65. \n\n- **not_P** is the complementary probability, representing the chance that he does not show up. This would be 1 - P, so approximately 0.35. \n\n- **para_P** is similar to P, as it assesses the possibility of him attending the same event. Given that it's essentially the same question, I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n- **Q** considers whether Musk will make a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024. Given his history of making announcements that impact the cryptocurrency market, I would estimate this probability at 0.60.\n\n- **P_and_Q** evaluates the likelihood of both P and Q occurring. Since these events are somewhat independent but can have overlapping influences, I would estimate this to be lower than either P or Q alone, possibly around 0.39.\n\n- **P_or_Q** captures the probability that at least one of the events occurs. This should be higher than either individual probability, likely around 0.75.\n\n- **Q_and_not_P** examines the scenario where Musk makes an announcement but does not attend the event. This would be lower than Q alone, as it introduces additional conditions. I would estimate this at around 0.20.\n\n- **Q_given_P** assesses the likelihood of Musk making an announcement given that he shows up at the event. This is likely to be higher than Q alone, given that his presence at the event may influence his decision to make an announcement. I would estimate this at about 0.70.\n\nIn summary, these probabilities are interconnected, with some being dependent on others. The relationships must adhere to the consistency rules, ensuring that complementary probabilities and combinations align mathematically. This ensures a coherent and logical framework for evaluating these predictions.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.39,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.70 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.35,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "65da20ac-c384-4223-a73a-c55009b79efe", "title": "Will Doug Burgum not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Doug Burgum is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

This could be influenced by market conditions and his interests, leading to a moderate estimate for Q.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring is likely lower than either event happening individually, as they are not guaranteed to happen simultaneously. This requires careful estimation based on the probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one of P or Q occurring)**: This probability should be higher than the individual probabilities of P and Q, as it accounts for the possibility of either event happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not P)**: This situation is plausible if Musk makes an announcement without attending the conference. The probability should reflect the likelihood of Q occurring independently of P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given P)**: If P occurs, the likelihood of Q may increase, as Musk's attendance could be linked to making an announcement. This conditional probability should reflect that relationship.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: P and Q are somewhat independent events, but they can influence each other, especially in the context of Q_given_P. The probabilities must be carefully calibrated to reflect these relationships while adhering to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.65, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.50) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.30 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09431067947124139, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047155339735620694, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44426165831931935, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
