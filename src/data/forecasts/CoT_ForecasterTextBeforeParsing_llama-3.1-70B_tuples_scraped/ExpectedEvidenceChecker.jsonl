To estimate the probability of Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President, we need to consider several factors. Firstly, Joe Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. Secondly, the Democratic Party has not shown any significant opposition to his candidacy. Thirdly, there is no clear indication that Joe Biden's health or personal circumstances would prevent him from running. Fourthly, the announcement of not seeking re-election would be a significant political decision that would likely be made after careful consideration and consultation with party leaders and advisors. Lastly, the timeframe for the announcement is relatively short, with only about 2 weeks left before the resolution date. Considering these factors, I believe that it is unlikely that Joe Biden will announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The clause has been the subject of legal debate regarding its applicability to Trump due to his role in the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nGiven the legal and political complexities involved, the probability of Trump being removed or blocked under this clause is influenced by several factors:\n\n1. Legal Interpretation: The interpretation of Section 3 and its applicability to Trump's actions is a subject of legal debate. Different courts or state officials might have varying interpretations, affecting the likelihood of removal.\n\n2. Political Environment: The political climate and the stance of state governments (particularly those controlled by Democrats, who might be more inclined to pursue such actions) play a crucial role. States might be hesitant to take such a drastic step due to its unprecedented nature and potential political backlash.\n\n3. Timing and Procedure: The process of removing someone from the ballot under Section 3 involves legal proceedings and possibly court decisions. The timing of such actions and the speed at which they are resolved would be crucial, given the proximity to the election date.\n\n4. Precedent and Public Opinion: The lack of modern precedent for applying Section 3 in this manner, combined with the divisive nature of the issue, adds uncertainty. Public opinion, both nationally and within specific states, could influence political will to pursue or block such actions.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a plausible legal argument for Trump's disqualification under Section 3, the political, procedural, and timing hurdles make it less likely.

The question also requires knowledge of the political process, particularly the Republican National Convention's role in selecting the party's nominee for the presidential election. To answer this question, we need to consider the following factors: 1. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This section states that individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States are disqualified from holding public office. However, this section has rarely been invoked, and its application is unclear in modern times. 2. Donald Trump's actions: Depending on the context, some of Donald Trump's actions, such as his role in the January 6th US Capitol attack, could be considered as engaging in insurrection or rebellion. However, this is a matter of interpretation and would likely be subject to legal challenges. 3. State-level decisions: The question asks about removal or blocking from primary election ballots at the state level. States have different laws and procedures for ballot access, and it's unclear whether any state would attempt to invoke Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to block Trump from the ballot. 4. Republican National Convention: If Trump is not selected as the nominee, it's possible that some states might consider removing him from the ballot. However, this would likely be a contentious issue, and the Republican Party might resist such efforts.

This means that we are already assuming that Biden will no longer be President by the end of July 2024, which could be due to various reasons such as resignation, death, or other circumstances. Given this assumption, we need to assess the likelihood of his death being announced before market close on Friday, July 26th. To estimate this probability, we should consider the following factors: 1. The reasons for Biden ceasing to be President: If he resigns or is removed from office for reasons unrelated to his health, it's less likely that his death will be announced soon after. However, if he ceases to be President due to health reasons or death, it's more likely that his death will be announced before the end of July. 2. The timing of the announcement: The question specifies that the announcement must be made before market close on Friday, July 26th. This gives us a specific timeframe to work with. 3. The likelihood of Biden's death: While we can't predict the future with certainty, we can consider Biden's age and health status. As of my knowledge cutoff, Biden is 80 years old, which is considered old for a head of state. However, he has not publicly disclosed any life-threatening health conditions. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Biden's death being announced before market close on Friday, July 26th, conditional on him ceasing to be President before the end of July 2024, is around 0.4. This reflects a relatively high probability due to Biden's age and the assumption that he will no longer be President by the end of July, but also acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the reasons for his departure and the timing of the announcement."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.019940585008100004, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.004985146252025001, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.20808741071652384, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, the 14th Amendment's Section 3, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort to its enemies, are disqualified from holding federal office. For Donald Trump to be removed from the primary ballot under this amendment, a state would need to take official action, such as a court decision, legal documentation, or an official state government announcement, confirming that Trump has been disqualified due to his alleged involvement in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack or any other insurrection or rebellion.

Historically, the USA has been one of the top-performing countries in the Olympics, consistently ranking high in the medal table. However, there have been instances where other countries have surpassed them, such as China in 2008 and the USSR in the 1980s.

However, it is also possible that they win more Gold medals than Silver, especially if they have a strong performance in events where they typically excel, such as track and field, swimming, and gymnastics.

In the 2019 general elections, the INC suffered a significant defeat, winning only 52 seats in the Lok Sabha. However, the party has been working to revamp its organization and strategy since then. 2. Current Political Landscape: The current ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has been facing several challenges, including economic slowdown, rising unemployment, and criticism over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. This could potentially create an opportunity for the INC to regain ground. 3. Leadership: The INC has been led by the Gandhi family for most of its history, but the party has been criticized for its lack of strong leadership. Rahul Gandhi, the current leader, has been working to rebrand himself and the party, but his ability to connect with voters remains a question mark. 4. Coalition Politics: Indian politics has become increasingly fragmented, with many regional parties holding significant sway. The INC may need to form alliances with other parties to form a government, which can be a complex and unpredictable process. 5. Economic and Social Factors: The Indian economy has been facing significant challenges, including a slowdown in growth, rising inequality, and social unrest.

However, we can look at historical trends and the current state of Olympic sports to make an educated estimate. In recent Olympic Games, there have been several countries that have won their first-ever medals. For example, at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, countries such as Bermuda, Qatar, and the Philippines won their first-ever gold medals. Additionally, countries such as Kosovo, Fiji, and Jordan won their first-ever medals in any color. Given the increasing competitiveness and diversity of Olympic sports, it is likely that more countries will win their first-ever medals in the future. Furthermore, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been actively working to increase participation and inclusivity in the Olympics, which could lead to more countries winning medals. However, it is also important to note that winning an Olympic medal is an extremely challenging task, and many countries may not have the resources, infrastructure, or talent to compete at the highest level. Taking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of at least 5 countries winning their first Olympic medal at the 2024 Games is around 0.7.

The presence of female candidates increases the likelihood of a female nominee, assuming they garner significant support. 3. Voter Preferences: There's evidence to suggest that a significant portion of the Democratic electorate is open to or even prefers a female candidate. This could be due to a desire for representation, policy preferences, or a reaction to the current political climate. 4. Primary Process: The Democratic primary process involves a complex system of caucuses and primaries, delegate allocation, and superdelegates. While this process can be unpredictable, it also allows for a wide range of candidates to participate, increasing the chances for a female candidate to emerge as the nominee. 5.

To analyze this, we need to break down the components of the question. First, we need to understand the condition: Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President before July 15, 2024. This event is unrelated to the control of Chasiv Yar by Russia, as it is a domestic US political event. Next, we need to consider the resolution criteria, which relies on the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map assessment of the location on June 1, 2024. The ISW map provides an independent assessment of the control of various locations in Ukraine, including Chasiv Yar. Given the condition and the resolution criteria, we can conclude that the control of Chasiv Yar by Russia on June 1, 2024, is independent of Joe Biden's decision not to accept the Democratic nomination. The ISW map assessment is based on military and territorial control, which is not directly influenced by US domestic politics. Therefore, the probability of Russia controlling Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, conditional on Joe Biden not accepting the Democratic nomination, is the same as the unconditional probability of Russia controlling Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024. To estimate this probability, we need to consider the current situation in Ukraine and the military dynamics between Russia and Ukraine. As of the knowledge cutoff, the conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, and the control of various locations is subject to change. However, without access to real-time information and specific data on the current situation in Chasiv Yar, it is challenging to provide a precise estimate. Nevertheless, we can make an educated guess based on the general trend of the conflict. Assuming that the conflict continues, and the military dynamics remain relatively stable, the probability of Russia controlling Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, is likely to be around 0.5, indicating a roughly even chance of Russia controlling the location."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "03023d6d-7b02-4732-af05-7619ee6bbdc3", "title": "Suppose Joe Biden does not announce by July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination.

First, it's essential to recognize that the exclusion of Ahmadinejad by the Guardian Council does not directly impact the dynamics between Iran and Israel. The relationship between the two countries is complex and influenced by various factors, including regional politics, nuclear ambitions, and security concerns. Israel has been known to carry out targeted attacks in Iran, primarily focused on disrupting Iran's nuclear program. However, these actions are typically taken in response to specific threats or provocations rather than as a direct reaction to internal Iranian political developments such as the exclusion of a presidential candidate. Given the lack of a direct causal link between Ahmadinejad's exclusion and Israel's military actions, it's challenging to establish a strong connection between the two events.

Losing a special election in a district that was previously held by a Republican could be seen as a negative indicator for the Republican Party's prospects in the 2024 general election. This might embolden Joe Biden and the Democratic Party, potentially making it more likely that Biden will decide to run for re-election. However, it's essential to note that the outcome of a special election in one congressional district is just one factor among many that might influence Joe Biden's decision. Other factors, such as his health, approval ratings, the state of the economy, and the Democratic primary field, are likely to play a much more significant role in his decision-making process.

Anthropic's Focus on Safety: Anthropic is known for its emphasis on AI safety. The company has publicly discussed the importance of safety in AI development and has likely invested significant resources into ensuring their models are safe and reliable. This focus suggests that they might be open to external scrutiny as a way to validate their safety measures. 2. Industry Trends: The AI industry is increasingly recognizing the value of transparency and external validation, especially concerning safety and ethics. Several companies and organizations have published reports or engaged in external audits to demonstrate their commitment to these principles. This trend could encourage Anthropic to follow suit. 3. Regulatory and Public Pressure: There is growing public and regulatory interest in AI safety. Governments and international bodies are starting to discuss and implement regulations related to AI development and deployment. Publishing a report on external red-teaming could be seen as a proactive step by Anthropic to demonstrate compliance with emerging standards and to build trust with regulators and the public. 4. Timing and Resource Allocation: The question specifies a deadline of June 30, 2024. This allows sufficient time for Anthropic to engage in external red-teaming and prepare a report, assuming they have not already done so. However, the allocation of resources (time, money, personnel) towards this effort could be a limiting factor. Companies often have competing priorities, and the decision to invest in such a report would depend on their current goals and challenges. 5. Precedent and Competitive Advantage: If Anthropic perceives that publishing such a report would offer a competitive advantage in terms of public trust and regulatory compliance, they might be more inclined to do so. Conversely, if they believe it could expose vulnerabilities or create unnecessary scrutiny, they might be less likely to publish. Considering these factors, there seems to be a reasonable basis for believing that Anthropic might publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The application of this clause to Donald Trump would depend on legal interpretations and actions taken by state governments or courts. Given the highly polarized political environment and the legal complexities involved, predicting the outcome with certainty is challenging. However, several factors can guide our reasoning: 1. Legal Challenges and Interpretations: The application of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to Donald Trump would likely face significant legal challenges. Courts would need to interpret whether Trump's actions meet the criteria for 'insurrection or rebellion.' This process could be lengthy and contentious. 2. State-Level Actions: The decision to remove or block Trump from a primary election ballot would need to be made at the state level, either through government action or court rulings. This introduces variability, as different states might have different interpretations of the law and different political wills to pursue such actions. 3. Political Considerations: The political climate and the will of state governments and courts to take such actions against a major political figure would also play a significant role. The decision would not be solely based on legal interpretations but also on political considerations and public opinion. 4. Timeframe: The question specifies a resolution date of July 15, 2024. Given the time it takes for legal proceedings and the complexity of the issue, it's uncertain whether such actions could be initiated and concluded by this date. Considering these factors, while there is a possibility that legal challenges could lead to Trump being removed or blocked from a primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the legal, political, and time constraints make it less likely.

To answer this question, we need to consider the implications of Trump's removal from the ballot on the presidential election and Biden's presidency. Firstly, it's essential to note that Trump's removal from the ballot does not directly affect Biden's presidency. Biden's term as President is not contingent upon Trump's participation in the election. Therefore, unless other factors come into play, such as Biden's resignation, death, or impeachment, he is likely to remain President through July 2024. Secondly, we need to consider the potential impact of Trump's removal on the Republican Party's chances in the election. If Trump is blocked from the ballot, the Republican Party may need to find an alternative candidate, which could potentially weaken their chances of winning the election. However, this does not directly affect Biden's presidency, as he would still be in office until the end of his term or until he is removed through impeachment or resignation.

This condition seems plausible, given that the report mentions that only two safe-seat members have publicly urged Biden to drop out, and two endangered Democrats have written off his chances. Regarding the EU's trade policies, the EU has been actively engaged in trade disputes with China, and imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs would be consistent with their recent actions. The EU has already imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels and steel, and there have been reports of ongoing investigations into Chinese EV imports.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, polling methodology, and sampling errors. However, 538's national polling average is a robust metric that aggregates data from multiple polls, reducing the impact of individual poll variability. As of the question's creation date (February 22, 2023), the 2024 presidential election is still over a year away, and the polling landscape is likely to change substantially before July 15, 2024. Nevertheless, we can make an educated estimate based on historical trends. In the 2020 presidential election, the polling average margin between Trump and Biden was relatively stable, with Biden maintaining a lead of around 7-10 percentage points throughout most of the campaign. However, it's crucial to note that the 2024 election is a different contest, with potentially different voter dynamics and issues at play. Given the uncertainty and volatility of polling data, it's challenging to predict with high confidence that Trump's lead will fall within a specific range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4) on a particular date (July 15, 2024). However, we can make a rough estimate based on the assumption that the polling average will continue to fluctuate within a reasonable range. Assuming a normal distribution of polling average margins, with a mean of around 0 (i.e., a tied election) and a standard deviation of approximately 2-3 percentage points (based on historical data), we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead falling within the specified range. Using a normal distribution calculator or software, we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 as follows: P(3 < Trump's lead \u2264 4) \u2248 P(3 < X \u2264 4), where X is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 2.5 (a rough estimate). Using a normal distribution calculator, we get: P(3 < X \u2264 4) \u2248 0.1314. However, this calculation assumes a normal distribution, which might not accurately represent the true distribution of polling average margins. To account for this uncertainty, we can apply a conservative adjustment to the estimated probability. Considering the historical volatility of polling data and the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 presidential election, we can adjust the estimated probability downward to reflect the challenges in predicting polling averages with high precision.

However, in recent years, the competition has become increasingly fierce, and the voting system has changed, making it more challenging for countries to qualify. That being said, Ireland has shown resilience and adaptability in the face of these changes. In 2022, Ireland's entry, Brooke Scullion, failed to qualify for the Grand Final, but in 2023, the country's entry, Wild Youth, managed to secure a spot in the Grand Final, finishing 12th overall. This recent success suggests that Ireland is still a competitive force in the competition. Looking ahead to 2024, it's difficult to predict with certainty how Ireland's entry will perform, as the song and artist have not been officially announced.

First, let's assume that Joe Biden dropping out of the race would create a significant change in the dynamics of the Democratic primary. This would likely lead to a re-evaluation of the remaining candidates and potentially create new opportunities for other candidates to gain traction. Given this scenario, it's reasonable to assume that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) would want to provide a platform for the remaining candidates to debate and showcase their policies.

Historically, there have been tensions between Israel and Iran, with Israel expressing concerns over Iran's nuclear program and support for militant groups in the region. There have been instances of attacks and covert operations attributed to Israel within Iran and against Iranian interests in the past. However, the escalation to a deadly attack resulting in at least five fatalities is a significant threshold. Given the current geopolitical climate, including ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the specific animosity between Israel and Iran, there is a plausible scenario where such an attack could occur. However, predicting the exact timing and nature of such events is challenging due to the complexity of international relations and the secrecy surrounding military operations. The time frame specified (before May 1, 2024) is relatively short, which might reduce the likelihood simply due to the constraints of planning and executing such an operation. However, the unpredictability of geopolitical events and the willingness of nations to act unilaterally in their perceived interests mean that even short time frames can be significant.

Given these factors, it's difficult to estimate the exact probability of Ted Cruz becoming the nominee. However, we can make an educated guess based on his past performance and current political landscape. Ted Cruz has a strong conservative base and has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party. He has also been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2024 presidential election.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The clause has been invoked in recent years in the context of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, with some arguing that Trump's actions or inactions related to the event could potentially trigger this clause. However, the application of Section 3 is not straightforward and involves complex legal and political considerations. For Trump to be removed or blocked from a primary election ballot under this section, a state would need to take official action based on a legal determination that he is disqualified under the clause. This could involve a court decision, a state election official's ruling, or legislative action. Given the polarized political environment and the controversial nature of invoking the Disqualification Clause against a former president, it is challenging to predict with certainty how states will proceed. However, several factors suggest that the probability of Trump being removed or blocked from a primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, is relatively low. First, the legal process for determining whether an individual is disqualified under Section 3 is complex and would likely involve lengthy legal battles, which may not be resolved by the specified date. Second, the political will to pursue such action against a former president, especially one as divisive as Trump, is uncertain and could be influenced by a variety of factors, including political calculations and public opinion. Lastly, the question's resolution strictly pertains to the situation as of July 15, 2024, without accounting for legal battles, appeals, or reversals that might occur afterward, which further complicates the prediction.

To answer this question, we need to consider the potential impact of a presidential incapacitation on the economy and inflation. First, it's important to note that the 25th Amendment Section 4 is a rare and extraordinary event that has never been invoked in U.S. history. If it were to happen, it would likely create significant uncertainty and potentially disrupt financial markets. However, the impact on inflation, specifically the Core CPI, is less clear. Inflation is influenced by a complex array of factors, including monetary policy, economic growth, labor market conditions, and supply chain disruptions. While a presidential incapacitation could potentially lead to changes in economic policy or market volatility, it's unlikely to have a direct and immediate impact on the Core CPI. Moreover, the Core CPI is a lagging indicator, meaning it reflects past economic conditions rather than current or future ones. The July Core CPI data will likely reflect economic conditions in June and earlier, before the presidential incapacitation. Given these considerations, it's reasonable to assume that the presidential incapacitation would not have a significant impact on the July Core CPI. Therefore, the probability of the Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July is likely to be similar to the probability of it happening under normal circumstances. Historically, the Month-over-Month Core CPI has increased by more than 0.1% in about 70% of the months since 2020. However, this probability may be influenced by various factors, including the current economic environment and monetary policy. Taking into account these factors and the uncertainty surrounding the presidential incapacitation, I estimate the probability of the Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July to be around 60%."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "15dfa3d1-9ce9-4d2f-9381-05ad64383335", "title": "Given Biden is not declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August, will the Month-over-Month US Core CPI increase by more than 0.1% in July?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) do not invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time).\n\nThe duration of the incapacity does not matter for this condition.

To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the 25th Amendment and the Core CPI. The 25th Amendment deals with presidential succession and disability, while the Core CPI is a measure of inflation. There is no direct link between the two, and the invocation of the 25th Amendment would not have a direct impact on the Core CPI. However, it's possible that the political instability and uncertainty surrounding the invocation of the 25th Amendment could have an indirect impact on the economy and inflation. For example, if the invocation of the 25th Amendment leads to a change in government policy or a loss of confidence in the government, it could potentially impact inflation. Despite this, the probability of the Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024 is largely driven by economic factors such as demand and supply, monetary policy, and external shocks, rather than political events. Given the current economic conditions and the fact that the Core CPI has been relatively stable in recent months, I would estimate the probability of the Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024 to be around 0.6.

Current military trends: The Ukrainian military has been making gains in recent months, pushing Russian forces back in some areas. However, the Russian military still has significant resources and capabilities. 2. Geopolitical factors: The conflict in Ukraine is influenced by various geopolitical factors, including diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions, and military aid to Ukraine. These factors can impact the military situation on the ground. 3. Timeframe: The question is asking about control on June 1, 2024, which is approximately 5 weeks from the question's creation date.

Given this assumption, we need to consider the likelihood of Joe Biden dropping out of the presidential race. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, we can look at historical trends and current political climate. As of the question's creation date (2021-07-03), Joe Biden has not shown any indication of dropping out, and it's unclear what circumstances would lead to such a decision. Assuming Joe Biden does drop out, the likelihood of a reliable media outlet covering the story at least 6 hours in advance depends on various factors, such as the source of the information, the outlet's journalistic standards, and the competitiveness of the news cycle. Reliable media outlets typically have a strong track record of verifying information before publishing, which might lead to a delay in reporting. However, in today's fast-paced news environment, outlets are often under pressure to break news quickly. If a reliable source confirms Joe Biden's dropout, it's possible that a media outlet might report on it promptly, potentially within the 6-hour timeframe. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of a reliable media outlet covering Joe Biden's dropout story at least 6 hours in advance, conditional on Donald Trump Jr. being the Republican nominee, to be around 0.4.

To answer this question, we need to consider the likelihood of Joe Biden dropping out and the likelihood of a reliable media outlet covering the story in advance. First, let's consider the likelihood of Joe Biden dropping out. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at historical trends and current circumstances. Joe Biden has been a prominent figure in politics for many years and has shown no indication of dropping out of the race. In fact, he has been actively campaigning and has a strong chance of winning the Democratic nomination. Therefore, the likelihood of him dropping out is relatively low. Next, let's consider the likelihood of a reliable media outlet covering the story in advance. In today's fast-paced news cycle, it's common for news outlets to break stories quickly, often with unofficial confirmations. If Joe Biden were to drop out, it's likely that a reliable media outlet would cover the story quickly, possibly with unofficial confirmation from sources close to the Biden campaign. However, the question specifies that the outlet must cover the story at least 6 hours in advance, which adds an extra layer of complexity. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of a reliable media outlet covering Joe Biden's dropout story at least 6 hours in advance if he drops out as follows: Probability: 0.4. This probability reflects the relatively low likelihood of Joe Biden dropping out, combined with the possibility of a reliable media outlet covering the story in advance. While it's possible that a media outlet could break the story early, the 6-hour time frame adds some uncertainty, leading to a lower probability estimate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0894479516069876, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0223619879017469, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4805076843136365, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The competition for the nomination is expected to be fierce, with several well-known and well-funded candidates already in the race. 3. Tucker Carlson's Political Influence: Tucker Carlson is a highly influential media personality with a significant following. His opinions and views are widely disseminated, and he has a strong platform from which he could potentially launch a political career. However, influence in media does not directly translate to political viability or success in party nomination processes. 4.

Rumors and Speculation: The article from People.com suggests that there is speculation about Taylor Swift playing Dazzler, indicating some level of consideration or discussion about her involvement in the project. However, it's essential to differentiate between rumors and confirmed roles. 2. Taylor Swift's Acting Career: Taylor Swift has acted in a few projects, but her primary focus is music. Her acting roles have been limited, which might suggest a lower likelihood of her taking on a role in a film like 'Deadpool and Wolverine' unless it aligns closely with her interests or schedule. 3. Cameo Appearances: The nature of the question allows for any type of appearance, including cameos, which are often uncredited and brief. Given Taylor Swift's popularity and the nature of Deadpool films (known for breaking the fourth wall and including unexpected cameos), a cameo is plausible if she is interested and available. 4. Lack of Official Confirmation: As of the question's creation, there is no official confirmation of Taylor Swift's involvement in 'Deadpool and Wolverine.' The lack of confirmation does not rule out the possibility but suggests that if she is involved, it might not be a significant or announced role. 5.

If the movie is still in production or post-production around the time of the question, there's a window for casting decisions to be made or announced.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) receives a CinemaScore of B- or lower. To answer this question, we need to analyze the relationship between the CinemaScore of 'Trap' and the box office performance of 'Deadpool & Wolverine'. First, let's examine the CinemaScores of M. Night Shyamalan's recent films. The scores range from B+ to C, indicating that his films tend to receive average to below-average audience ratings. If 'Trap' receives a CinemaScore of B- or lower, it suggests that the film may not be well-received by audiences. However, the box office performance of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is not directly related to the CinemaScore of 'Trap'. The success of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' depends on various factors such as the quality of the film, marketing, competition, and audience demand. Given the lack of a direct relationship between the CinemaScore of 'Trap' and the box office performance of 'Deadpool & Wolverine', it's challenging to make a definitive prediction. However, we can make an educated guess based on the general trends in the film industry. Typically, a film's box office opening is influenced by factors such as the popularity of the franchise, the quality of the film, and the marketing campaign. Since 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is a highly anticipated film with a large fan base, it's likely to perform well at the box office regardless of the CinemaScore of 'Trap'. Therefore, I estimate the probability that the domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will be higher than the combined openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' as follows: Probability: 0.7. This probability reflects my uncertainty about the relationship between the CinemaScore of 'Trap' and the box office performance of 'Deadpool & Wolverine'. While there is no direct correlation, the popularity of the 'Deadpool' franchise and the anticipation surrounding 'Deadpool & Wolverine' suggest that it will perform well at the box office."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.029541913988075735, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Francis Suarez's Nomination: For Francis Suarez to be nominated, he would need to either win the primaries convincingly or emerge as a consensus candidate if the convention becomes contested. Suarez, being the Mayor of Miami, might have a strong local base but lacks the national recognition and political machinery that someone like Trump or other established figures might have. 4.

Suarez's chances would depend on how he positions himself, his performance in debates and primaries, and whether he can garner enough support from party delegates.

The company has a culture that values transparency and open criticism, which suggests a predisposition towards embracing principles like 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure.' 2. The Nature of the Principle: The principle in question aligns with ethical standards in research and development, particularly in fields as impactful as AI. It promotes a safe environment for employees and external critics to highlight potential risks without fear of retribution, which is crucial for the responsible development of AI technologies. 3. External Pressure and Community Expectations: Given the increasing scrutiny of AI companies and their practices, there is growing external pressure to adopt ethical standards and transparency. The fact that this principle is being highlighted by righttowarn.ai indicates a level of community expectation for such commitments. 4. Timeframe and Feasibility: The timeframe given (before July 1, 2024) is relatively short, which might influence OpenAI's ability to make a formal commitment. However, given the informal nature of the required commitment (which could be as simple as a tweet or a statement in an interview), it seems feasible for OpenAI to make such a commitment within this timeframe. 5. Verification by Metaculus and righttowarn.ai: The requirement for Metaculus to verify OpenAI's commitment to the satisfaction of at least one member of righttowarn.ai adds a layer of complexity. However, this also indicates that the commitment needs to be tangible and satisfactory to external observers, which could motivate OpenAI to make a genuine commitment.

The number of traders in a market can be influenced by various factors, such as market volatility, investor interest, and overall market conditions.

Firstly, it's worth noting that the Olympics are a premier international sporting event, and the presence of top athletes from around the world creates an environment conducive to record-breaking performances. The fact that the Olympics are being held in Paris, France's home country, might actually increase the motivation and pressure on French athletes to perform well, but this is not directly relevant to the question. The key factor to consider is that the number of world records broken is largely independent of France's performance in the Olympics. World records can be broken by athletes from any country, and the presence or absence of French athletes in the top 5 does not significantly impact the overall number of records broken. Historically, the Olympics have consistently seen a significant number of world records broken, often in the range of 20-30 records per Games. This is due to the high level of competition, advances in technology and training methods, and the fact that athletes are often at the peak of their physical conditioning during the Olympics. Given these factors, it's reasonable to assume that the number of world records broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics will be similar to previous Games, regardless of France's performance.

Firstly, let's consider the likelihood of no member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, we can look at current trends and past data. As of the knowledge cutoff in 2022, none of the Trump family members have officially announced their candidacy for the 2024 presidential election. However, Donald Trump has expressed interest in running again, and his popularity among Republicans remains high. Assuming no significant changes in the political landscape, it's possible that a Trump family member might still be a contender. Let's assign a subjective probability of 0.6 to the event that no Trump family member is the nominee. Secondly, let's consider the likelihood of Trump's lead over Biden being between 2 and 3 points on July 15, 2024. This depends on various factors, including the state of the economy, geopolitical events, and the candidates' campaign strategies. As of the knowledge cutoff, Biden's approval ratings have been relatively stable, while Trump's popularity has been declining.

Given the uncertainty and the fact that we're still far from the election date, let's assign a subjective probability of 0.2 to the event that Trump's lead is between 2 and 3 points. To calculate the overall probability, we need to multiply the probabilities of both events.

His involvement in politics has been mostly limited to supporting his father and other Republican candidates. Given that the question will resolve in August 2024, and the Republican National Convention typically takes place in the summer, it is likely that the nominee will be someone who has been actively campaigning and building a strong base of support within the party. As of my knowledge cutoff in December 2023, there was no indication that Donald Trump Jr. was planning to run for president.

In contrast, a generic Democrat may be seen as a more abstract or neutral option, which could lead to less polarization.

To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between Trump's performance in the Manifold polls and the likelihood of Donald Trump Jr. becoming the Republican nominee. Firstly, it's essential to note that the Manifold polls are not necessarily indicative of the broader Republican primary electorate. The polls may have a specific demographic or ideological bias that may not reflect the views of the Republican National Convention delegates who will ultimately choose the nominee. Secondly, even if Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents, it's unclear how this would translate to support for Donald Trump Jr. in the Republican primary. The Republican primary is a complex process with many factors at play, including candidate popularity, fundraising, endorsements, and debate performance. Lastly, it's worth noting that Donald Trump Jr. has not officially announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. While he has been involved in politics and has a high profile, his candidacy is not guaranteed.

This experience could be beneficial in a future run. Secondly, Cruz has maintained a relatively high profile within the Republican Party since his 2016 run, serving as a senator from Texas and being a vocal advocate for conservative causes. This could help him maintain a level of visibility and influence within the party. However, there are also several factors that suggest Cruz may not be the nominee. For example, the Republican Party has a history of nominating candidates who have not run before, such as Donald Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012. Additionally, Cruz's 2016 campaign was marked by controversy and division within the party, which could make it harder for him to build a coalition of support in 2024. Finally, the 2024 Republican primary field is likely to be highly competitive, with several other high-profile candidates potentially running.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that predicting election outcomes, especially 3 years in advance, is inherently uncertain. Polling numbers can fluctuate significantly due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, campaign events, and external factors like economic conditions or global events. That being said, we can look at some general trends and patterns in presidential election polling. Typically, polling averages tend to converge closer to the election date, with larger leads becoming less common. However, it's not uncommon for candidates to have leads within the 3-4 point range, especially during the summer months before the election. Given the current political climate and the fact that the election is still over 2 years away, it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, we can make an educated estimate based on historical data. According to 538's national polling average, since 2000, there have been 12 instances where a candidate had a lead between 3-4 points in the summer months (June-August) before the election. Out of these 12 instances, 7 resulted in the candidate winning the election, while 5 did not. Assuming that the historical trend continues, we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024.

To assess this probability, we need to consider the relationship between Trump's polling lead and the likelihood of Cruz becoming the nominee. If Trump's lead is within a narrow range (<= 3 or > 4), it suggests that the election is competitive, and the Republican Party may consider alternative candidates. However, it is essential to note that the Republican National Convention's decision is not directly determined by polling numbers. The key factor in determining the nominee is the delegate count, which is typically decided during the primary elections and caucuses. While polling numbers can influence the primary elections, they do not directly translate to delegate counts.

Firstly, the market reaching 377 traders by July 15 is a condition that seems plausible given the context that the market is linked and presumably has some level of interest or activity. However, without specific data on the market's current trader count, growth rate, or historical trends, it's challenging to assign a precise probability to this event. Given the lack of detailed information, we might conservatively estimate the probability of this condition being met as moderately high, around 0.7, acknowledging that markets can be unpredictable but also assuming some level of organic growth or interest. Secondly, the likelihood of 'House of the Dragon' S2E7 being rated >8.5 on IMDB two days after its release depends on several factors, including the quality of the episode, audience expectations, and broader cultural or critical reception. Given that previous episodes have received high ratings, it suggests a positive trend, but individual episode reception can vary widely. Without specific information on the episode's content, production quality, or early reviews, we must rely on general trends. The IMDB rating system is also influenced by various factors, including the number of ratings, which can affect the precision and stability of the rating. Considering these factors, we might estimate the probability of the episode receiving a rating >8.5 as somewhat favorable, given the series' previous success, but not extremely high due to the variability of individual episode reception and the strict inequality of the rating threshold. Combining these considerations, the overall probability of both conditions being met (the market reaching 377 traders and the episode being rated >8.5) would be the product of the individual probabilities.

To estimate this probability, we can look at the IMDB ratings of previous episodes of \"House of the Dragon\" as well as other popular TV shows in the same genre.

Assuming that the market has fewer than 377 traders, I estimate that the probability of \"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 having an IMDB rating greater than 8.5 two days after its release is around 60%.

To assess this probability, we need to consider the likelihood of two events: (1) Kimberly Cheatle resigning as the Director of the U.S. Secret Service within the next 90 days, and (2) Joe Biden dying before Saturday. First, let's consider the likelihood of Kimberly Cheatle resigning as the Director of the U.S. Secret Service within the next 90 days. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at historical data on the tenure of Secret Service directors. According to publicly available information, the average tenure of a Secret Service director is around 3-4 years. Given that Kimberly Cheatle has been in her position since 2022, it's possible that she may resign or be replaced within the next 90 days, but it's not extremely likely. Second, let's consider the likelihood of Joe Biden dying before Saturday. As of the creation date of this question (July 14, 2024), Joe Biden is 81 years old. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at actuarial tables to estimate the probability of death within a given timeframe. According to the Social Security Administration's Actuarial Life Table, the probability of a male dying between the ages of 81 and 82 is around 6.5%. However, this probability is based on a large population and doesn't take into account individual factors such as health status, lifestyle, and access to medical care. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of Joe Biden dying before Saturday as relatively low, likely less than 1%. However, since the question is conditional on Kimberly Cheatle resigning within the next 90 days, we need to consider the joint probability of both events occurring. Assuming that the resignation of Kimberly Cheatle and the death of Joe Biden are independent events (which may not be the case in reality), we can multiply the probabilities of each event to get the joint probability. Let's assume a 10% probability of Kimberly Cheatle resigning within the next 90 days (which is likely an overestimate).

The ICC has been involved in investigating these allegations, and in 2021, it launched an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Israel and Hamas. 3. The likelihood of ICC action: Given the ICC's mandate and the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is possible that the ICC might issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders if it finds sufficient evidence of war crimes or other crimes within its jurisdiction. However, the ICC's actions are often slow and deliberate, and it may take time for the court to gather evidence and make a decision. 4. The condition of a terrorist act in France: The condition of a terrorist act in France during the 2024 Summer Olympics is unrelated to the ICC's investigation into Israeli leaders. However, it is possible that the ICC might expedite its investigation or take action in response to increased international pressure or attention to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the ICC issuing arrest warrants for listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024, conditional on a terrorist act occurring in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics, is relatively low. This is because the ICC's actions are often slow and deliberate, and it is unlikely that the court would rush to issue arrest warrants in response to a terrorist act in France."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "1452808b-7410-4ad5-ae0f-b25cfef9b530", "title": "Conditional on no terrorist act occurring in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics, will the ICC issue arrest warrants for listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: No terrorist attack in metropolitan France injures and/or kills at least one person, other than the terrorist(s), between, and inclusive of, the day of the Opening Ceremony (26 July 2024) and the day of the Closing Ceremony (11 August 2024).

First, it's essential to acknowledge that forecasting election outcomes based on polling averages, especially more than a year in advance, is inherently uncertain. Polling averages can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, including changes in voter sentiment, the impact of political events, and the margin of error in polls. Given the current information, as of my last update in 2023, there is no concrete data on the polling averages for July 15, 2024.

Historical Trends: In many presidential elections, polling averages have shown significant shifts in the months leading up to the election. These shifts can be due to debates, campaign strategies, and unforeseen events. Current Climate: The political climate can change rapidly due to unforeseen events, policy decisions, and candidate performances. This unpredictability makes it challenging to forecast with precision. Reliability of Polling Data: Polling averages, especially those aggregated by reputable sources like 538, provide a snapshot of public opinion at a particular moment. However, they are subject to margins of error and can be influenced by the methodology of individual polls. Given these considerations, predicting a very specific range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4) for Trump's lead over Biden is highly speculative. The actual polling average on July 15, 2024, could be influenced by a multitude of factors not yet known.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the relationship between the two events. First, let's analyze the condition (P). The same nation winning more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics is a relatively rare event. There are eight women's team sports, and each sport has a different set of competing nations. The probability of a single nation winning gold in at least two of these sports is low, as it requires a high level of performance across multiple sports. Now, let's consider the outcome (Q). An athlete winning multiple medals in tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics is also a challenging task. Tennis is an individual sport, and athletes compete in different events, such as singles and doubles. Winning multiple medals requires an athlete to perform exceptionally well in multiple events. The key question is whether there is a correlation between the two events. Is there a reason to believe that a nation winning multiple women's team sports would increase the likelihood of an athlete winning multiple medals in tennis? There is no obvious connection between the two events. The performance of a nation in team sports does not directly impact an athlete's performance in individual sports like tennis. Given the lack of correlation between the two events, we can assume that the probability of an athlete winning multiple medals in tennis is independent of the nation winning multiple women's team sports. Therefore, we can estimate the probability of the outcome (Q) based on historical data and general trends in tennis. Historically, it is not uncommon for top tennis players to win multiple medals in a single Olympics. For example, at the 2012 London Olympics, Serena Williams won two gold medals in singles and doubles. However, this is still a relatively rare achievement, and the probability of an athlete winning multiple medals in tennis is likely to be low. Based on these considerations, I estimate the probability of an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics, given that the same nation wins more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics, to be around 0.2."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "380eb9c1-775a-4bb0-b23f-ed7e7238b397", "title": "Conditional on no nation winning more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics, will an athlete win more than one medal for tennis?", "body": "This question examines the outcomes of the 2024 Paris Olympics with two specific conditions:\n\nCondition: No nation wins more than one women's team sport.

Firstly, the 25th Amendment Section 4 states that the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet can declare the President incapacitated if they believe he is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' This is a significant threshold, requiring a consensus among the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet that the President is indeed incapacitated.

To estimate this probability, let's break down the question into its components. Firstly, we need to consider the probability that Larry Elder is not the Republican nominee. While Elder has run for governor of California, he has not been a major contender for the Republican presidential nomination in recent years. Therefore, it is likely that he will not be the nominee. Secondly, we need to consider the probability that Trump's lead over Biden is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024. This requires us to make an assumption about the state of the presidential race at that time. Since the question is asking for a specific range of values (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4), we need to consider the probability that the polling average falls within this range. Given the uncertainty of the presidential race and the fact that polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time, it is difficult to estimate the probability of Trump's lead falling within this specific range. However, we can make an educated guess based on historical trends and the current state of the race. Historically, presidential elections have often been close, with polling averages fluctuating within a few percentage points.

Other members of the Trump family, such as Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, have been involved in politics to varying degrees, but they have not yet announced any plans to run for the presidency. While they may have a degree of influence and popularity among some Republican voters, it's unclear whether they would be able to build a strong enough campaign to secure the nomination. Looking at the broader Republican field, there are several other potential candidates who may challenge Trump for the nomination, including established politicians and newcomers. However, at this point in time, it's difficult to predict with certainty who will ultimately emerge as the strongest competitors. Given these factors, I believe that the most likely scenario is that Donald Trump will secure the Republican nomination, but there is still a degree of uncertainty and potential for other candidates to emerge."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "372cfbba-fb7c-417e-a298-30a74dd5238e", "title": "Facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, will Trump gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents?", "body": "There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6.

Francis Suarez, as the Mayor of Miami, has a strong reputation as a moderate Republican who has been successful in a predominantly Democratic city.

To answer this question, we need to consider the current political landscape and the factors that could influence the polling numbers. First, it's important to note that the question assumes the Democratic Party will not have a brokered convention, which means that a single candidate will likely win the nomination on the first ballot. This reduces the uncertainty around the Democratic nominee's identity and allows us to focus on the general election matchup between Trump and Biden. Currently, the polling average from 538 shows a relatively close race between Trump and Biden, with Trump leading by around 2-3 points. However, it's essential to consider the historical context and the factors that could influence the polling numbers in the coming months. One key factor is the economy. If the economy continues to perform well, it could benefit Trump's re-election chances. On the other hand, if the economy experiences a downturn, it could hurt Trump's chances and potentially narrow the gap between him and Biden. Another factor is the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a significant impact on the country, and its effects could continue to shape public opinion and voting behavior. If the pandemic subsides, it could lead to increased optimism and potentially boost Trump's chances. However, if the pandemic worsens, it could lead to increased dissatisfaction with the government's response and potentially hurt Trump's chances. Additionally, we need to consider the candidates' campaign strategies and messaging. Both Trump and Biden will likely focus on key issues such as the economy, healthcare, and national security. The effectiveness of their messaging and campaign tactics could influence the polling numbers. Given these factors, it's difficult to predict with certainty what the polling numbers will be on July 15, 2024.

FiveThirtyEight's election forecast is based on a combination of national and state-level polling data, as well as other factors such as economic indicators and historical trends. The forecast model uses a Monte Carlo simulation to generate a probability distribution of possible outcomes, which is then used to determine the probability of each candidate winning. Given that Trump's lead is relatively small (between 2 and 4 points), it is likely that the forecast model will still show a competitive race, with Biden having a significant chance of winning. However, the fact that Trump is leading in the polls suggests that the model may still favor Trump, at least slightly. To estimate the probability that Biden will be projected as the favorite, we need to consider the following factors: 1. The size of Trump's lead: A 2-4 point lead is relatively small, and it is possible that the forecast model will show a significant amount of uncertainty in the outcome. 2. The margin of error: Polling averages have a margin of error, which can affect the accuracy of the forecast. A small lead like Trump's could be within the margin of error, making it possible for Biden to still be favored. 3. Other factors: FiveThirtyEight's forecast model incorporates other factors beyond just polling data, such as economic indicators and historical trends. These factors could potentially favor Biden, even if Trump is leading in the polls.

However, it's also important to consider potential challenges and controversies that might affect Trump's nomination chances. These include legal issues, political polarization within the Republican Party, and the emergence of strong alternative candidates. The Republican Party has a history of sometimes nominating establishment candidates over more populist or controversial figures, especially if there's a perception that the latter might not perform well in a general election. Given these factors, while there is a strong possibility that Donald Trump could secure the nomination due to his existing base and political influence, there are also significant uncertainties and potential challenges that could affect his chances."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "5fcd153f-6362-47aa-9281-ed4922e612b6", "title": "Conditional on Donald Trump being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, will the closing value of BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024, be greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

First, let's consider the impact of Donald Trump's nomination on global markets. Historically, Trump's presidency has been associated with significant market volatility, partly due to his unpredictability and policies that can have far-reaching economic implications. However, the direct impact of his nomination on the BSE SENSEX, which is the benchmark index of the Bombay Stock Exchange in India, is less clear-cut. Indian markets are influenced by a wide array of factors, including domestic economic policies, global economic trends, and geopolitical events. Given the condition, we're essentially trying to forecast the performance of the BSE SENSEX under a specific political scenario in the United States. However, the relationship between U.S. political events and the Indian stock market is indirect and influenced by numerous variables, including global economic conditions, trade policies, and investor sentiment. Without a clear, direct link between Trump's nomination and the performance of the BSE SENSEX, and considering the inherent unpredictability of financial markets, it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, we can consider general trends and the broad impact of political uncertainty on markets. Given the wide range of possible outcomes and the complexity of factors influencing the BSE SENSEX, I would argue that the probability of the closing value being greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000 is somewhat uncertain and not heavily influenced by Trump's nomination alone."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "fc0dafd3-2e3e-4c87-85bd-19dcb83564b9", "title": "Given Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, will the BSE SENSEX close between 75k and 77k on July 21, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Since the question does not provide any details about the songs, performances, or voting patterns for Eurovision 2024, and without historical data suggesting a correlation between Albania's and Georgia's qualification, we must rely on general assumptions.

However, it's also important to note that both countries participate in the competition with their own unique entries, and their qualification is determined by separate sets of voters in their respective semi-finals. Therefore, the probability of Georgia qualifying given that Albania qualifies would likely be similar to Georgia's overall chances of qualifying based on their past performance and the general competitiveness of the contest.

To assess the probability of this event, we must consider the legal and political landscape. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The clause has been invoked in recent years to disqualify individuals who participated in the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. However, applying this clause to a high-profile figure like Donald Trump is unprecedented and would likely face significant legal and political challenges. The process of removing or blocking Trump from a primary election ballot would require a state-level decision, which would likely be subject to appeals and potentially reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the complexity of the issue, the political polarization surrounding Trump, and the short timeframe before the resolution date, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Trump will be removed or blocked from any state's primary election ballot. That being said, there are a few factors that suggest a non-negligible probability of Trump being removed or blocked: 1. Growing efforts to invoke Section 3: There have been increasing efforts by some lawmakers, legal experts, and advocacy groups to explore the possibility of invoking Section 3 to disqualify Trump from holding federal office. 2. State-level initiatives: Some states have introduced legislation or taken steps to explore the possibility of removing Trump from their primary election ballots. 3. Trump's controversial past: Trump's involvement in the January 6, 2021, insurrection and his subsequent actions have led to widespread criticism and calls for accountability. Despite these factors, the probability of Trump being removed or blocked from a primary election ballot remains uncertain due to the following reasons: 1. Legal hurdles: The process of removing or blocking Trump would require a state-level decision, which would likely face appeals and potentially reach the U.S. Supreme Court. 2. Political polarization: The issue is highly politicized, and any attempt to remove or block Trump would likely face intense opposition from his supporters and Republican lawmakers. 3. Time constraints: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which leaves limited time for the necessary legal and political processes to unfold.

The absence of such reports before July 5, 2024, would indeed indicate that the condition has been met. Now, let's consider the outcome. Fidesz-KDNP's performance in the 2024 European Parliament elections will depend on various factors, such as the Hungarian political landscape, voter sentiment, and the strategies employed by different parties.

In the context of Eurovision, each country's qualification is determined by a separate voting process, and the qualification of one country does not directly affect the qualification of another. However, we can consider some indirect factors that might influence the probability. Firstly, both Denmark and Poland are part of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the Eurovision Song Contest. As members of the same organization, they might have similar voting patterns or preferences. However, this factor is relatively weak, as each country's voting is independent. Secondly, we can look at the historical performance of Poland in Eurovision. Poland has participated in the contest many times and has had varying degrees of success. While they have not won the contest, they have qualified for the Grand Final several times in recent years. This suggests that Poland has a reasonable chance of qualifying, but it's not a guarantee. Lastly, we should consider the fact that the question is conditional on Denmark qualifying. If Denmark qualifies, it might indicate a strong performance from the Nordic countries or a specific voting pattern that favors them. However, this does not directly impact Poland's chances, as their qualification is determined by a separate voting process.

Nature of Political Campaigns: Political campaigns are inherently unpredictable.

However, incumbent presidents generally have significant advantages in terms of name recognition, fundraising, and party support, which can make it less likely for them to drop out. 3. Biden's Current Status: As of my last update, Joe Biden is the incumbent president. The fact that he is an incumbent could suggest a lower likelihood of dropping out due to the aforementioned advantages. However, without current information on his political standing, health, or any potential scandals, it's difficult to assess his situation accurately. 4.

The performance of Deadpool & Wolverine at the box office does not have a clear connection to Disney's announcement of a new Moana-themed ride. The two events are largely independent, with the former being a matter of box office performance and the latter being a matter of Disney's internal decision-making and marketing strategy. Given this independence, the probability of Disney announcing a new Moana-themed ride should not be significantly affected by the performance of Deadpool & Wolverine. Therefore, we should consider the probability of Disney announcing a new Moana-themed ride based on other factors, such as Disney's past behavior, industry trends, and any available information about Disney's plans. Without any specific information about Disney's plans or intentions, it is difficult to estimate the probability of a new Moana-themed ride being announced. However, we can consider some general factors that might influence this decision. For example, Moana is a popular Disney franchise, and theme park attractions based on popular franchises are often successful. Additionally, Disney has been investing in new attractions and experiences at its theme parks in recent years. Taking these factors into account, a reasonable estimate for the probability of Disney announcing a new Moana-themed ride might be around 0.2-0.3.

First, let's consider the context. The Politico report suggests that there is already some dissatisfaction among Democratic lawmakers with Biden's chances of winning in November. If at least 5 named Democratic lawmakers were to publicly pressure Biden to drop out, it could potentially create a narrative that Biden is weak or unpopular within his own party. This could, in turn, affect how Manifold respondents perceive Biden and potentially boost Trump's popularity. However, it's essential to note that the relationship between Democratic lawmakers' opinions and public opinion is complex. While some respondents might be influenced by the perception that Biden is weak, others might not be swayed by the opinions of a few lawmakers. Moreover, the question is asking about a specific scenario where Trump's popularity increases by at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat.

The first event is related to the internal dynamics of the Democratic Party and the level of support for Biden's candidacy.

The fact that some Democratic lawmakers might or might not pressure Biden to drop out does not directly influence how Manifold respondents would vote in a hypothetical election.

The question's criteria for resolution, requiring credible reports of an attack attributed to Israel that results in at least five fatalities within Iran's borders, sets a specific threshold that narrows the scope of possible outcomes.

However, without any specific information about these factors, it is challenging to make an accurate prediction. That being said, we can make an educated guess based on general knowledge about presidential elections. In recent years, polling averages have often shown fluctuations within a few percentage points. Assuming that the election is relatively competitive, it is plausible that Trump's lead could be within the specified range. However, it is essential to note that this prediction is highly uncertain and subject to various factors that may influence the election outcome.

This is a conditional probability problem. To solve it, we need to consider the probability of the Pacers winning the NBA Finals in a typical year, and then adjust for the fact that the Clippers are not winning. In a typical year, there are 30 teams in the NBA, and each team has an equal chance of winning the championship (ignoring factors like team strength, injuries, and other external factors). Therefore, the probability of the Pacers winning the NBA Finals in a typical year is 1/30. However, we are given the condition that the Clippers do not win. This means that we can eliminate the Clippers from the list of possible winners, leaving 29 teams. Since the Pacers are one of these 29 teams, their probability of winning increases. To calculate the new probability, we can use the formula for conditional probability: P(Pacers win | Clippers don't win) = P(Pacers win and Clippers don't win) / P(Clippers don't win). Since the Clippers not winning is a given, we can simplify the formula to: P(Pacers win | Clippers don't win) = P(Pacers win) / (1 - P(Clippers win)). We know that P(Pacers win) = 1/30, and P(Clippers win) = 1/30 (since each team has an equal chance of winning). Plugging in these values, we get: P(Pacers win | Clippers don't win) = (1/30) / (1 - 1/30) = (1/30) / (29/30) = 1/29.

Firstly, the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 index over the next three months. It is influenced by various market and economic factors, including geopolitical events, interest rates, and investor sentiment. Given the condition that there are no credible reports of an attack attributed to Israel within Iran's borders that results in the death of at least five individuals between the publication date of this question and May 1, 2024, we can assume that the geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran will not escalate significantly during this period. However, there are other factors that could impact the volatility index, such as global economic trends, interest rate changes, and other geopolitical events unrelated to the Israel-Iran conflict. Historically, the VXVCLS has been sensitive to changes in market conditions, and its value can fluctuate significantly over time. Considering these factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the VXVCLS will be higher on July 20, 2024, compared to July 20, 2023.

As of the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), the 538 national polling average shows Trump leading Biden by 2.4 points. However, polling averages can fluctuate over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, polling methodology, and sampling variability. Given the current lead of 2.4 points, it is plausible that Trump's lead could increase or decrease by a small margin over the next six days (until July 15, 2024). However, a significant increase in Trump's lead to beyond 4 points seems less likely, as it would require a substantial shift in voter sentiment or a major polling outlier.

First, we need to assess the likelihood of Kamala Harris not being the Democratic VP nominee. While Harris has been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, there are many other potential VP candidates. However, without more information on the current dynamics and preferences of the Biden campaign, we can't make a precise estimate. Let's assume for the sake of argument that there's around a 30-40% chance she won't be the nominee. Next, we need to consider how this might impact the polling numbers. It's difficult to predict exactly how the absence of Harris as VP nominee would affect the polls, as it depends on various factors, including the chosen nominee's popularity, campaign strategies, and external events. However, it's likely that the impact would be relatively small compared to other factors like the state of the economy, Trump's approval ratings, and the overall campaign dynamics. Given the current uncertainty and the many factors at play, it's challenging to make a precise estimate of Trump's lead. However, considering that the 2024 presidential election is still over a year away, it's likely that the polls will fluctuate significantly before July 15, 2024.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update, I do not have real-time data, but historically, presidential elections in the United States are highly competitive, with margins often being quite close, especially in national polling averages. 2. Polling Average Nature: 538's national polling average is a weighted average of polls, which tends to smooth out outliers and provides a more stable view of the race. This means that the average is less likely to show extreme leads but can capture general trends. 3. Scenario Dependency: The scenario assumes Joe Biden is not president by the end of July, which could be due to various reasons such as resignation, impeachment, or other unforeseen circumstances. This condition introduces a high degree of uncertainty and could significantly impact polling numbers, as it would be an unprecedented situation. 4. Time Frame: The question focuses on a specific time frame (July 15, 2024) for the polling average, which is relatively close to the hypothetical scenario's condition (Biden not being president by the end of July). This proximity suggests that the polling average might not fully reflect the aftermath of such a significant event, as public opinion and political landscapes can shift rapidly. Given these considerations, predicting the exact margin of Trump's lead (if any) over Biden is challenging without knowing the specific circumstances leading to Biden not being president and how those circumstances might influence public opinion and polling numbers. However, considering the general competitiveness of U.S. presidential elections and the smoothing effect of polling averages, a lead of 2 to 4 points for Trump (or Biden, depending on the direction of the lead) seems plausible for a specific snapshot in time, especially in a situation as unprecedented and potentially volatile as the one described. However, the question's conditions introduce a high degree of uncertainty, making it difficult to provide a precise probability without more context or information about the political climate at that time. Therefore, my reasoning leans towards a moderate probability, acknowledging the competitiveness of such elections and the potential for significant shifts in public opinion due to the unprecedented scenario described."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.002503635921166786, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0006259089802916964, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0728786749935182, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, 538's national polling average is a robust metric that aggregates data from multiple polls, providing a more stable and reliable indicator of the election landscape. As of the question's creation date (June 28, 2023), the 2024 presidential election is still over a year away, and the polling landscape is likely to shift significantly before July 15, 2024. Nevertheless, we can look at the historical context and current trends to make an informed estimate. In recent presidential elections, polling averages have often shown significant fluctuations in the months leading up to the election. For instance, in the 2020 presidential election, the polling average lead for Joe Biden over Donald Trump varied between 3-10 points throughout the summer and fall of 2020. Given the uncertainty and volatility of polling averages, it's challenging to predict with high confidence that Trump's lead will fall within a specific range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4) on a particular date (July 15, 2024). However, we can make an educated estimate based on the assumption that the polling average will continue to fluctuate within a reasonable range. Assuming a normal distribution of polling average fluctuations, we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead falling within the specified range.

Firstly, considering Glenn Youngkin as the Republican nominee, the current information available does not suggest that he is the front-runner for the Republican nomination.

Generally, polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors, including changes in the political landscape, candidate performances in debates, and campaign strategies. However, since Glenn Youngkin is not Donald Trump, this condition would mean that Trump is not the Republican nominee, and thus would not be the one leading or trailing Biden in the polls. Given these considerations, the question seems to contain a contradictory scenario.

First, let's consider the context. The question assumes that the Democratic Party requires only one round of voting in its roll call ballot to formally nominate its candidate for the 2024 US presidential election, thus not having a brokered convention. This implies that there is a strong consensus among Democrats to nominate Joe Biden as their candidate. Given this context, it is likely that most Democrats will support the plan to virtually nominate Biden early, as it would be seen as a way to unify the party and avoid a potentially divisive convention. However, there may still be some Democrats who oppose this plan, possibly due to concerns about the lack of transparency or the potential for disenfranchisement of certain groups. To estimate the probability of at least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan, we need to consider the number of Democrats who might be willing to take a public stance against the party's leadership. While there are 219 Democrats in the House and 48 Democrats in the Senate, not all of them may be willing to sign a public letter opposing the plan. Assuming that a small but significant minority of Democrats might be willing to take a public stance against the plan, we can estimate the probability of at least 20 Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan. Let's assume that around 5-10% of Democrats might be willing to take a public stance against the plan, which would translate to around 10-20 Democrats.

First, let's consider Sifan Hassan's chances of winning a medal. She is a highly accomplished distance runner with multiple Olympic and World Championship medals. However, the Olympic Games are highly competitive, and there are many talented athletes in the distance events. Assuming Hassan is in top form, her chances of winning a medal are still relatively high, but not guaranteed. Let's estimate her chances of winning a medal at around 70-80%. Next, let's consider the probability of Kalenjin athletes winning both the men's and women's marathon races. Kalenjin athletes have a strong tradition of success in distance running, and many top marathon runners have Kalenjin roots. However, the Olympic marathon events are highly competitive, and there are many talented athletes from other ethnic backgrounds. Assuming a strong field of competitors, the probability of a Kalenjin athlete winning the men's marathon is around 30-40%, and the probability of a Kalenjin athlete winning the women's marathon is around 20-30%. Now, let's consider the conditional probability of Kalenjin athletes winning both marathon races, given that Sifan Hassan fails to win a medal. If Hassan fails to win a medal, it's likely because she faced strong competition from other athletes, including potentially some Kalenjin athletes. In this scenario, the probability of Kalenjin athletes winning both marathon races might be slightly higher than if Hassan had won a medal. Let's estimate this conditional probability at around 10-20%. However, we need to remember that this is a conditional probability, and the condition (Hassan failing to win a medal) is not guaranteed to occur. To get the overall probability of Kalenjin athletes winning both marathon races, we need to multiply the conditional probability by the probability of the condition occurring.

Historical Precedent: Incumbent presidents, especially those who have expressed interest in running for re-election, rarely decline their party's nomination. The last time an incumbent president chose not to run for re-election was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, under very different circumstances. 2. Political Ambition and Age: Joe Biden has already indicated his intention to run for re-election. While his age (he will be 81 in 2024) could be a factor, it has not deterred him from expressing his willingness to run again. 3. Party Support and Dynamics: The Democratic Party has generally shown support for Biden's presidency and his potential re-election bid. There's no significant indication within the party that would suggest a strong push for him not to run. 4. Chris Christie as the Nominee: The identity of the Republican nominee could influence Biden's decision, but Christie's nomination would not likely be a factor that would cause Biden to decline the Democratic nomination. Christie's stance and policies might be seen as more moderate compared to other potential Republican candidates, but this would more likely affect the general election dynamics rather than Biden's decision to run. 5. Health and Personal Factors: While Biden's health could be a factor, there has been no public indication that his health would prevent him from running. Personal factors could also play a role, but given his expressed desire to run, it seems unlikely he would change his mind based on the scenario described. Considering these factors, the scenario in which Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination seems unlikely.

Firstly, both Malta and Georgia have had varying degrees of success in Eurovision over the years. Malta has qualified for the Grand Final 28 times out of 34 attempts, while Georgia has qualified 7 times out of 14 attempts. This suggests that Malta has a stronger track record, but Georgia is still a competitive participant. Secondly, the fact that Malta qualifies for the Grand Final does not directly impact Georgia's chances, as the qualification process is independent for each country.
