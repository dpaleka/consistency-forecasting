However, direct attacks resulting in significant casualties are relatively rare due to the potential for severe consequences. Both countries have shown restraint in the past, often preferring proxy conflicts or limited engagements. Given the current global situation, including the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict and the Middle East's complex web of alliances and rivalries, the likelihood of such an attack seems low. Major powers, including the United States and European countries, would likely condemn such an action, potentially leading to severe diplomatic and economic repercussions for Iran. Additionally, while Iran has been involved in various regional conflicts and has supported militant groups hostile to Israel, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, direct attacks within Israel's borders that result in significant casualties are rare and usually met with strong Israeli retaliation.

To estimate the probability of this event, we need to consider the number of nations that have not yet won an Olympic medal and the likelihood of them winning one in 2024. According to the Olympic Games' history, there are currently around 200 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Out of these, around 100 NOCs have not yet won an Olympic medal. However, not all of these NOCs participate in every Olympic Games, and some may not have a strong enough team to win a medal. In recent Olympic Games, the number of nations winning their first-ever medal has been around 2-3 per Games. For example, at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, two nations (Burkina Faso and Turkmenistan) won their first-ever Olympic medals. Given this information, it seems plausible that at least five nations could secure their first-ever Olympic medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, it's also possible that fewer nations may win their first medal, especially if some of the stronger NOCs dominate the competitions. To estimate the probability, let's assume that around 10-15 NOCs that have not yet won an Olympic medal have a reasonable chance of winning one in 2024. Out of these, let's assume that 5-7 NOCs have a higher chance of winning a medal, given their recent performance and team strength.

To answer this question, we need to consider the typical patterns of these respiratory viruses and their impact on hospitalization rates. COVID-19, influenza, and RSV typically have distinct seasonal patterns, with peaks occurring at different times of the year. However, there can be overlap between these peaks, and the combined peak rate for all three viruses may not necessarily coincide with the peak rate for each individual virus. Historical data from the CDC's RESP-NET dashboard shows that the peak rates for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV can occur within a few weeks of each other, but it's not uncommon for there to be a gap of several weeks or even months between the peaks. Given the variability in the timing of these peaks, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether the peak weekly hospitalization rate per 100,000 will occur within a month of the combined peak for COVID, influenza, and RSV.

First, we need to understand the current state of the contract between the US government and Verisign. The Cooperative Agreement between the US Department of Commerce (DOC) and Verisign has been in place since 2006 and has been renewed several times. The current agreement is set to expire on November 30, 2024. Given this information, we can analyze the likelihood of the US government discontinuing the contract before August 3, 2024. There are a few factors to consider: 1. The contract's expiration date is after the specified date in the question (August 3, 2024). This suggests that the contract is not set to expire naturally before the specified date. 2. There have been no recent public indications or announcements from the US government or Verisign that suggest the contract will be discontinued early. 3. The process of discontinuing a contract of this nature typically involves a formal process, including notice periods and potential negotiations. Given the complexity of the contract and the importance of the .com domain, it's unlikely that the US government would abruptly discontinue the contract without a significant reason.

The GUE/NGL is a left-wing political group in the European Parliament, comprising socialist, communist, and green parties from various EU member states. In the 2019 European Parliament elections, the GUE/NGL group won 41 seats, making it the fifth-largest group in the parliament. To assess the likelihood of GUE/NGL securing the highest number of seats in 2024, we need to consider several factors: 1. Current polling trends: There are no reliable, EU-wide polls available for the 2024 European Parliament elections. However, national polls and European Parliament polls from 2023 suggest that the center-right European People's Party (EPP) and the center-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) will likely remain the two largest groups. 2. Electoral system: The European Parliament elections use a proportional representation system, which tends to favor larger parties. This makes it more challenging for smaller groups like GUE/NGL to secure a significant number of seats. 3. Voter turnout: Voter turnout in European Parliament elections is generally lower than in national elections, which can lead to unpredictable results. However, this factor is unlikely to significantly benefit GUE/NGL. 4. Party alliances and coalitions: The GUE/NGL group might form alliances or coalitions with other left-wing parties, potentially increasing their chances of securing more seats. However, the effectiveness of such alliances is uncertain. Given these factors, it is unlikely that GUE/NGL will secure the highest number of seats in the 2024 European Parliament elections.

They have already taken steps to demonstrate their commitment to safety, such as publishing research on AI safety and engaging with the broader AI safety community. 2. Industry trends: The AI industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of safety and transparency. Many organizations, including Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, have published safety reports or engaged in independent safety evaluations. This trend suggests that Anthropic may follow suit to maintain their reputation and demonstrate their commitment to safety. 3. Regulatory pressures: Governments and regulatory bodies are starting to take a closer look at AI safety. While there are no explicit regulations requiring independent safety evaluations, the trend is towards increased scrutiny. Anthropic may proactively release a safety report to demonstrate their commitment to safety and transparency, potentially preempting future regulatory requirements. 4. Competitive advantage: By releasing a safety report, Anthropic can demonstrate their leadership in AI safety and differentiate themselves from competitors. This could be particularly important in the current AI landscape, where safety concerns are becoming increasingly prominent. However, there are also reasons to be cautious: 1. Lack of explicit commitment: While Anthropic has emphasized safety, they haven't explicitly committed to releasing an independent safety evaluation report. 2.

Historical Volatility: The BSE SENSEX has historically been volatile, with significant daily fluctuations. However, this volatility also means that large movements in either direction are possible. 2. Current Market Trends: Without access to real-time market data, I'll assume that the current market trends are neutral, with no significant bullish or bearish sentiments dominating the market. 3. Economic Indicators: India's economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates, can influence the stock market. However, without specific data, I'll assume that these indicators are stable and not significantly impacting the market. 4. Global Market Influences: Global economic events, trade wars, and geopolitical tensions can impact the Indian stock market. However, I'll assume that these factors are not significantly affecting the market at this time. Given these assumptions, I'll use a probabilistic approach to estimate the likelihood of the BSE SENSEX closing between 75,000 and 77,000 on July 21, 2024. Assuming a normal distribution of daily returns, I'll use the 68-95-99.7 rule, which states that about 68% of values lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% within 3 standard deviations. Without knowing the current value of the BSE SENSEX or its historical standard deviation, I'll make a rough estimate.

Using these estimates, I'll calculate the probability of the BSE SENSEX closing between 75,000 and 77,000: * The range of 75,000 to 77,000 is approximately 2-4 standard deviations away from the assumed current value of 72,000. * Using the 68-95-99.7 rule, the probability of the BSE SENSEX closing within 2 standard deviations (i.e., between 70,000 and 74,000) is approximately 95%. * The probability of closing between 75,000 and 77,000 is roughly half of the remaining 5% (i.e., 2.5%), assuming a symmetric distribution."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.13615405986313966, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.06807702993156983, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.48766342849859967, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, there are a few factors to consider that might increase the likelihood of a nation winning more than one team sport: 1. Dominant Teams: Some nations have historically been very strong in multiple sports, such as the United States in basketball and volleyball, or Australia in field hockey and water polo. If these dominant teams perform as expected, it could increase the chances of a nation winning multiple sports. 2. Overlap in Talent: Some sports have overlap in the skills required, and nations with strong programs in one sport might find it easier to be competitive in another. For example, handball and basketball both require quick movements, teamwork, and scoring abilities, so a nation strong in one might have an easier time competing in the other. 3. Investment in Women's Sports: In recent years, there has been an increased investment in women's sports globally, leading to more competitive teams across various nations. While this increases overall competitiveness, it also means that nations with strong sports programs are likely to see benefits across multiple sports. Given these considerations, while there is a good chance for diversity in winners due to the competitive nature of the Olympics, the historical dominance of certain nations in specific sports, the potential overlap in talent, and the increased investment in women's sports suggest that there is a reasonable probability of the same nation winning more than one women's team sport."}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "6dcd18a9-35b6-4ded-b005-39d7f03cc4e4", "title": "Will a single country secure victory in more than one women's team event at the 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This question will be answered with **No** if women's teams from eight distinct National Olympic Committees (NOC) each clinch gold in these eight team sports at the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\n- association football\n- 3\u00d73 basketball\n- 5\u00d75 basketball\n- field hockey\n- handball\n- rugby sevens\n- volleyball\n- water polo.\n\nConversely, if a single NOC wins at least two of these competitions, the answer is **Yes**.\n\nThe question can be settled as soon as it becomes evident that one of these scenarios will occur (e.g., neither team in the final of the last event has claimed victory in any of the others).", "resolution_date": "2024-08-11T15:30:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-29T00:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "The question is asking whether a single country will win more than one women's team event at the 2024 Olympics.

Les R\u00e9publicains, a center-right party, and the National Rally, a far-right party, have historically been rivals, and their ideologies and voter bases have been distinct. However, in recent years, there have been signs of rapprochement between the two parties, particularly in the context of the 2022 French presidential election, where the National Rally's candidate, Marine Le Pen, reached the runoff against Emmanuel Macron. Given the current political landscape in France, it is possible that Les R\u00e9publicains might consider a coalition with the National Rally to counterbalance the influence of the ruling party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, and to potentially gain more seats in the legislative elections. However, such a move would likely face opposition from some members of Les R\u00e9publicains who are hesitant to associate with the National Rally's more extreme views. Additionally, the National Rally has been trying to rebrand itself as a more mainstream party, and a coalition with Les R\u00e9publicains could help to further this goal. Nevertheless, the National Rally's radical wing might resist a coalition, fearing it could lead to a loss of their party's identity and voter base. Considering these factors, I believe that while there is a possibility of a coalition between Les R\u00e9publicains and the National Rally, it is not a certainty.

However, without knowing the current polling average and the trends leading up to July 15, 2024, it's difficult to assign a high probability to this specific outcome.

This has led to periods of heightened tension and occasional military posturing. However, both sides have generally avoided direct conflict, especially one that could lead to significant loss of life among their armed forces. Given the current global and regional political climate, there are factors that could increase the risk of conflict, such as increased military exercises by both sides, the potential for third-party involvement (e.g., the United States), and the ongoing competition for influence in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite these factors, the question hinges on the occurrence of a specific event (armed forces conflict death) within a relatively short timeframe (before June 6, 2024). Historically, while there have been incidents and near-misses, the threshold of armed forces conflict resulting in deaths has not been crossed in recent years. Both China and Taiwan have shown restraint in their interactions, suggesting a desire to avoid escalating tensions to the point of direct conflict. Furthermore, the international community, including major powers, has a vested interest in maintaining stability in the region, which could act as a deterrent against actions that might lead to significant conflict.

The Season 1 finale received a rating of 9.3, which is significantly higher than the average rating of the season. If we assume that the Season 2 finale will receive a similar boost in ratings, it's possible that it could exceed 8.5. Another factor to consider is the show's overall quality and popularity. 'House of the Dragon' has received widespread critical acclaim and has a dedicated fan base. This could contribute to a higher IMDb rating, especially if the season finale is well-received by fans and critics. However, it's also important to note that IMDb ratings can be influenced by various factors, such as the number of users who vote, the timing of the vote, and the overall sentiment of the fan base at the time of the vote. These factors can introduce uncertainty and make it more difficult to predict the outcome.

To answer this question, we need to consider the likelihood of Inflection conducting an external evaluation of their models' safety and making the findings public. There are a few factors to consider: 1. Inflection's commitment to safety: Inflection has stated that they take safety seriously and have implemented various measures to ensure the safe development and deployment of their AI models. This suggests that they may be open to external evaluations and transparency. 2. Industry trends: The AI industry is increasingly focusing on safety and transparency, with many companies conducting external evaluations and publishing their findings. This trend may encourage Inflection to follow suit. 3. Regulatory environment: There is growing regulatory pressure on AI companies to prioritize safety and transparency. Inflection may feel compelled to conduct an external evaluation and publish their findings to demonstrate compliance with emerging regulations. However, there are also factors that suggest Inflection may not release a document detailing findings from an outside evaluation of their models' safety by June 30, 2024: 1. Competitive advantage: Inflection may not want to share sensitive information about their models' safety, as this could potentially give their competitors an advantage. 2. Cost and resource constraints: Conducting an external evaluation and publishing the findings may require significant resources and investment, which Inflection may not be willing or able to allocate. Overall, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that Inflection is likely to release a document detailing findings from an outside evaluation of their models' safety by June 30, 2024.

The probability of the BSE SENSEX falling within a specific range (greater than 75k and less than or equal to 76k) on a given day is difficult to determine accurately. However, considering the continuous nature of stock prices and the fact that markets can fluctuate significantly over short periods, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of the index closing within any specific 1,000-point range on a given day is relatively low, especially without knowing the current market trends or the index's value as of the question's creation date."}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "9db2efd7-0a29-4606-8a39-647c517f6b3e", "title": "On July 21, 2024, will the BSE SENSEX close above 75,000 but not exceed 76,000?", "body": "This question is determined by the BSE SENSEX closing value on July 21, 2024, as reported by Yahoo Finance.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-23T19:40:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-12T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.2, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To provide a probability estimate for the BSE SENSEX closing above 75,000 but not exceeding 76,000 on July 21, 2024, we need to consider historical trends, current market conditions, and any available forecasts or predictions.

To assess this, we need to consider the current political climate and the process of holding a referendum in Scotland. Firstly, the Scottish National Party (SNP) has been a strong advocate for Scottish independence, and they have been in power in Scotland since 2007. In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won a fourth consecutive term, and their manifesto included a pledge to hold a second independence referendum. However, the UK government has consistently opposed a second independence referendum, and the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has stated that he will not grant permission for one. The UK government's position is that the 2014 independence referendum was a 'once in a generation' vote, and that Scotland should not have another referendum until a significant amount of time has passed. Despite this, the Scottish government has been exploring ways to hold a referendum without the UK government's consent. In January 2021, the Scottish government published a draft bill for a second independence referendum, which would allow the Scottish Parliament to hold a referendum without the UK government's approval. However, this bill has not yet been passed, and it is unclear whether it would be legally valid. Given the current political deadlock, it is uncertain whether a referendum will be held before May 3, 2024. While the Scottish government is keen to hold a referendum, the UK government's opposition makes it difficult to see a clear path forward. However, it's worth noting that the Scottish government has been actively pursuing a legal route to hold a referendum, and there have been some indications that the UK government might be willing to reconsider its position. For example, in January 2022, the UK government announced that it would be willing to consider a referendum if the Scottish government can demonstrate that there is a clear majority in favor of independence. Taking all these factors into account, I would estimate the probability of Scotland holding an official, sanctioned referendum on independence before May 3, 2024, as follows: Probability: 0.4. This probability reflects the uncertainty surrounding the current political situation and the lack of a clear path forward for holding a referendum.

However, the UK government has been reluctant to grant permission for another referendum. In 2022, the Scottish government announced plans to hold a referendum on October 19, 2023, but this was contingent on the UK government's approval, which has not been forthcoming.
