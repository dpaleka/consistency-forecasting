Firstly, the current political landscape and the Republican Party's dynamics are crucial. Historically, the Republican Party has chosen nominees with significant experience in politics, such as governors or senators. Donald Trump Jr., although a prominent figure in the party due to his father's presidency, lacks direct experience in elected office. Secondly, it's essential to look at the current field of potential candidates. While the question does not restrict itself to currently mentioned candidates, it's likely that established politicians like governors, senators, or even former President Donald Trump himself might be more likely to secure the nomination. Lastly, considering the timeline, the question resolves on August 1, 2024, which is around the time the Republican National Convention typically takes place. This leaves enough time for the field of candidates to evolve, for primaries to take place, and for the party to coalesce around a nominee. Given these factors, while it's impossible to rule out any possibility entirely in the unpredictable world of U.S. politics, the lack of direct political experience by Donald Trump Jr. and the typical preferences of the Republican Party for nominees suggest that his chances, although not negligible due to his name recognition and influence, are less likely compared to more seasoned politicians."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e182acfe-2dea-425f-afca-37a2fe27e1c8", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, neither Donald Trump Jr. nor Asa Hutchinson has officially announced their candidacy for the 2024 Presidential Election. 2. Donald Trump Jr.'s Political Influence: Donald Trump Jr. is a prominent figure in the Republican Party, largely due to his father's presidency and his own active role in politics. Despite this, he has not held public office, which could be a significant barrier to securing the nomination. 3. Asa Hutchinson's Political Career: Asa Hutchinson has had a long political career, including serving as the Governor of Arkansas and in the U.S. House of Representatives. His experience could make him a viable candidate, but his moderate stance might not align with the more conservative wing of the party, potentially affecting his chances. 4. Competition and Field of Candidates: The field for the Republican nomination is expected to be crowded, with several well-known candidates likely to run. This competition could make it challenging for either Donald Trump Jr. or Asa Hutchinson to secure the nomination, especially if more established political figures or candidates with stronger grassroots support enter the race. 5. Time to the Election: As of the question's creation in 2021, there is considerable time before the 2024 election. Political landscapes can shift dramatically over such periods, with new candidates emerging, and public opinion changing. Given these considerations, while both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson have potential paths to the nomination, the field is expected to be highly competitive, and neither has officially announced their candidacy as of my last update.

Furthermore, the Republican party has a history of nominating candidates who are not necessarily the most establishment-friendly or predictable choices. The party's base has shown a willingness to support outsider candidates, as evident from Trump's nomination in 2016. This trend might continue in 2024, potentially hurting Pence's chances.

First, let's consider event (a), Joe Biden's death before Saturday, July 26th, 2024. As of the knowledge cutoff in 2023, Joe Biden was 80 years old. According to the Social Security Administration's Actuarial Life Table, the probability of a person dying within a year at age 80 is approximately 14.2%. However, this probability is based on average life expectancy and does not take into account individual factors such as health conditions or lifestyle. Given that Joe Biden has been President since 2021 and has not shown any significant signs of poor health, it is reasonable to assume that his probability of death within the next year is lower than the average. However, it is still a possibility, and we should assign a non-zero probability to this event. Now, let's consider event (b), Biden not remaining President through the end of July 2024. This event includes the possibility of Biden resigning, dying, or otherwise ceasing to be President. While it is difficult to estimate the probability of Biden resigning or being removed from office, we can consider the historical precedent of Presidents serving out their terms. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, since World War II, only one President (Richard Nixon) has resigned from office. Given the low historical precedent for Presidential resignations or removals, it is reasonable to assign a low probability to this event. However, we should still consider the possibility of Biden's health declining or other unforeseen circumstances that could lead to his removal from office. Taking into account both events (a) and (b), we can estimate the overall probability of either event occurring. Assuming a probability of 5% for event (a) (lower than the average life expectancy due to Biden's apparent good health) and a probability of 1% for event (b) (based on historical precedent), we can calculate the overall probability as follows: Probability(event (a) or event (b)) = Probability(event (a)) + Probability(event (b)) - Probability(both events). Since the events are not mutually exclusive (Biden's death would also result in him not remaining President), we need to subtract the probability of both events occurring to avoid double-counting. Assuming that the probability of both events occurring is negligible (i.e., Biden's death is not directly related to his removal from office), we can simplify the calculation: Probability(event (a) or event (b)) \u2248 Probability(event (a)) + Probability(event (b)) = 5% + 1% = 6%. Therefore, based on these estimates, the probability of either event (a) or event (b) occurring is approximately 6%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.8486066553460572, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.2121516638365143, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 1.5675803581271577, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For event (a), it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Trump will be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. However, we can consider the following factors: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort to its enemies, are disqualified from holding federal office. Trump's involvement in the January 6, 2021, storming of the US Capitol and his alleged role in inciting the riot have raised questions about his eligibility for federal office under this clause. Several lawsuits and legal challenges have been filed against Trump, alleging that he is ineligible for federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. However, it is unclear whether these challenges will be successful or whether Trump will be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot as a result. The Republican Party has generally been supportive of Trump, and it is possible that he may still be able to participate in the primary election despite these challenges. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as 0.3. For event (b), it is also difficult to predict with certainty whether Trump will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. However, we can consider the following factors: Trump has a strong base of support within the Republican Party and has been a dominant figure in the party since his election in 2016. Trump has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and has been actively campaigning. However, Trump's popularity has declined in recent years, and there are other potential candidates who may challenge him for the nomination.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that no person shall be a senator or representative in Congress, or elector of president and vice president, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath to support the Constitution, has engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort to its enemies.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the Republican primary, it's difficult to estimate the probability of either Pence or Haley winning the nomination. However, we can consider some general trends and factors that may influence the outcome. One factor to consider is the current political climate. The Republican Party is currently divided between Trump loyalists and more moderate Republicans. If Trump were to win the primary, it's unlikely that either Pence or Haley would be chosen as the nominee. However, if Trump were to lose or drop out of the race, either Pence or Haley could potentially win the nomination. Another factor to consider is the popularity of Pence and Haley among Republican voters. According to recent polls, Pence and Haley are both relatively popular among Republicans, but they trail behind Trump in terms of name recognition and support. Based on these factors, I estimate that the probability of either Mike Pence or Nikki Haley being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election is around 20-30%.

(a) USA wins more Gold than Silver medals: Historically, the United States has been a strong performer at the Olympics, often ranking near the top in the medal count. However, winning more Gold medals than Silver is a specific and somewhat challenging benchmark. The U.S. has a broad and deep talent pool across many sports, which helps in accumulating a large number of medals. Yet, the competition at the top, especially from countries like China and Russia, is fierce. The dynamics can shift significantly from one Olympics to another based on various factors, including team preparation, new talent emergence, and the host country's performance boost. Given these considerations, while it's certainly possible for the U.S. to achieve this, it's not a guaranteed outcome. (b) USA tops the Olympic Medal Table: The U.S. has a strong track record in the Olympics, often competing for the top spot in the medal count. The criteria for topping the medal table, as described, first consider the number of Gold medals, then Silver, and finally Bronze. The U.S. has historically performed well across a wide range of sports, which helps in accumulating medals. However, the competition, especially from China, has been intense in recent Olympics. The host country often experiences a performance boost, but this factor will not be in play for the U.S. in Paris. Despite these challenges, the U.S. has the depth and breadth of athletic talent to potentially top the medal table. Given these considerations, the probability of either (a) or (b) occurring seems more likely than not, considering the historical performance of the U.S. in the Olympics and its broad talent base. However, because both outcomes are contingent on a variety of factors, including the performance of other countries, the emergence of new talent, and the dynamics of specific sports, the probability is not extremely high."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0013251983434954262, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00033129958587385655, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.051475319640206865, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, it's essential to note that the Republican National Convention is a complex event with many variables, including delegate votes, party politics, and candidate popularity. Predicting the outcome with certainty is challenging. Donald Trump Jr. is the son of former President Donald Trump, who has a significant influence on the Republican Party. However, it's unclear whether his son will be able to replicate his father's success. Chris Christie, on the other hand, is a well-known politician with a strong track record, but his popularity within the party is uncertain. Given the uncertainty surrounding both candidates, it's difficult to estimate the probability of both being selected as nominees. However, we can consider some general factors: 1. The Republican Party often favors established politicians with a strong track record, which might give Chris Christie an edge. 2. Donald Trump Jr.'s connection to his father could be both a blessing and a curse, as some delegates might view him as a continuation of his father's policies, while others might see him as unqualified. 3. The Republican National Convention is known for its unpredictability, with delegates often making last-minute decisions or switching allegiances.

Firstly, the Republican National Convention (RNC) is the ultimate decision-maker in selecting the party's nominee. While it's difficult to predict the RNC's choice with certainty, we can look at historical trends and current political dynamics. Historically, the RNC has often chosen candidates with strong political experience, name recognition, and a proven track record of winning elections. Donald Trump Jr., as the son of a former President, has some name recognition, but his political experience is limited compared to other potential candidates. Currently, the Republican Party is still reeling from the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, and it's unclear what direction the party will take in 2024. While Donald Trump Jr. has been involved in politics and has a strong following among some Republican voters, it's unclear whether he has the broad support and political acumen to win the RNC's nomination. Additionally, the Republican Party has a history of nominating candidates who are more establishment-friendly, and Donald Trump Jr.'s outsider status might work against him. Furthermore, the RNC's nomination process is often influenced by a variety of factors, including the candidate's ability to raise funds, build a strong campaign organization, and appeal to a broad coalition of voters. Given these factors, while it's possible that Donald Trump Jr. could be the Republican nominee, it's unlikely that he would be the RNC's top choice.

Ron DeSantis, as the Governor of Florida, has gained popularity for his handling of the state's affairs and his stance on various issues, making him a rising star within the party. 3.

Currently, ChatGPT is available in some EU countries, but its availability is limited due to regulatory concerns. For example, in early 2023, ChatGPT was unavailable in Italy due to concerns about data protection and privacy. However, OpenAI has been working to address these concerns and has made efforts to expand its services to more EU countries. In terms of regulatory issues, the EU has implemented several regulations that affect the availability of AI-powered services like ChatGPT. For example, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires companies to ensure that personal data is protected and that users have control over their data. OpenAI has stated that it is committed to complying with the GDPR and other EU regulations. Despite these challenges, OpenAI has expressed its intention to expand its services to more EU countries. In a statement, OpenAI said that it is 'committed to making ChatGPT available to users in the EU' and is 'working to address the regulatory and technical challenges' that have limited its availability in the region. Based on these factors, it seems likely that OpenAI will make ChatGPT generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024.

For part (a), considering the current political climate and the typical dynamics within the Democratic Party, it's plausible that some Democratic lawmakers might express dissatisfaction with Biden's candidacy. However, the requirement for at least 5 named individuals to collectively urge Biden to drop out in a coordinated effort before July 20th seems relatively high. While it's possible, the coordination and public declaration required make this scenario slightly less likely. For part (b), the scenario of Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the nomination before July 15, 2024, seems even less likely. Biden has shown no public indication of intending to drop out, and such a move would be unprecedented and strategically unusual given the timeline and political implications.

As of the current date (July 3rd), we are about 6 weeks away from the specified date (August 9th). In the world of politics and polling, 6 weeks is a significant amount of time, and many events can occur that might impact the model's predictions.

That being said, we can consider some general factors that might influence the model's predictions. Nate Silver's model takes into account various polling data, historical trends, and other factors to make predictions. If Kamala Harris's polling numbers improve or if other candidates experience setbacks, her odds of winning might increase. Conversely, if her polling numbers decline or other candidates gain momentum, her odds might decrease.

(a) Biden dropping out before July 20: Given the current political landscape and the fact that the 2024 US Presidential Election is still over a year away, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether Biden will drop out or not. However, considering his age and the potential for health issues, there is a non-negligible chance that he might not be able to continue his campaign. Additionally, if his popularity were to significantly decline or if he were to face significant challenges within his own party, it could also lead to him dropping out. That being said, Biden has shown resilience in the past, and it's possible that he will continue to lead the Democratic Party's ticket. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20 to be around 0.2. (b) Will Hurd being the Republican nominee: Will Hurd is a relatively unknown candidate, and the Republican Party has a large pool of potential nominees. While he has been mentioned as a potential candidate, it's difficult to assess his chances of winning the nomination. The Republican National Convention's selection process can be unpredictable, and many factors can influence the outcome, such as the candidates' performance in debates, their fundraising abilities, and the party's overall mood. Given the uncertainty surrounding Will Hurd's candidacy and the Republican National Convention's selection process, I would estimate the probability of Will Hurd being the Republican nominee to be around 0.05. Combining the probabilities: To estimate the probability of both conditions being met, we need to multiply the individual probabilities. Assuming that the events are independent, the combined probability would be: 0.2 (Biden dropping out) \u00d7 0.05 (Will Hurd being the Republican nominee) = 0.01.

Given the information available up to the creation date (June 22, 2023), there is no strong indication that President Biden intends to drop out or that his health or political situation would necessitate such an action. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, historical precedent suggests that incumbent presidents rarely drop out of elections voluntarily, especially without a compelling reason such as severe health issues or a significant political scandal. Therefore, the probability of event (a) seems relatively low. Event (b) pertains to Will Hurd becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. As of the creation date, the field of potential Republican nominees is broad and includes several well-known figures. Will Hurd, a former congressman, might be considered a long-shot candidate compared to more prominent figures within the Republican Party. The process of becoming a nominee involves winning primaries and caucuses or gaining significant support at the Republican National Convention, which is highly competitive and unpredictable. Given the competitive nature of the nomination process and the lack of information suggesting Hurd has a strong lead or significant momentum, the probability of event (b) also appears to be relatively low. Given that both events individually have low probabilities, the combined probability of either occurring would be slightly higher than each individual probability but still relatively low.

Industry Trends and Practices: The AI research community, including prominent players like OpenAI and Anthropic, has been increasingly focused on AI safety and transparency. Red-teaming, which involves simulating adversarial attacks or stress tests on AI systems to identify vulnerabilities, is a key aspect of safety research. Given the growing emphasis on safety and transparency, it's plausible that these organizations would engage in such practices. 2. Previous Actions and Commitments: Both OpenAI and Anthropic have demonstrated a commitment to safety and transparency in their research practices. OpenAI, for example, has published several papers and reports on the safety and limitations of their models. Anthropic has also been open about their safety protocols and research into AI robustness. This history suggests a likelihood of continued effort in these areas. 3. External Pressure and Collaboration: The AI safety community, along with regulatory bodies and the public, increasingly expects AI developers to prioritize safety and transparency. This external pressure, combined with the collaborative nature of AI safety research, makes it more likely that these companies will engage with external parties for red-teaming and publish the results. 4. Timeframe: The deadline of June 30, 2024, provides a specific timeframe for this action. Given the ongoing nature of AI safety research and the typical timelines for research projects, it's reasonable to expect that either company could plan, execute, and publish such a report within this period. 5. Potential for Collaboration: The question specifies the involvement of an external party, which could include academic institutions, other AI safety organizations, or independent researchers. The collaborative aspect makes it more feasible, as it allows for a division of labor and expertise. Considering these factors, the probability that either OpenAI or Anthropic will publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, seems relatively high.

Event 1: Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President - As of my last update in April 2023, there has been no significant indication from Joe Biden or his campaign that he intends to step down or not seek the Democratic nomination for the 2024 presidential election. Historically, incumbent presidents who have chosen not to run for re-election have made such announcements with varying degrees of notice. Given the current political climate and the typical timeline for presidential campaigns, it would be unusual but not unprecedented for such an announcement to be made before July 15, 2024. However, without concrete evidence or strong rumors suggesting otherwise, the likelihood of this event seems low. Probability: 0.15. Event 2: The Republican Party retaining Ohio's 6th congressional district in the 2024 special election - Ohio's 6th congressional district has historically leaned Republican. Bill Johnson, the incumbent as of my last update, has represented the district since 2011. While special elections can be unpredictable and are influenced by numerous factors including the candidates, the political climate at the time of the election, and turnout, the district's historical voting patterns suggest a Republican candidate would have an advantage. However, without knowing the specific candidates or the exact timing and circumstances of the special election, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. Probability: 0.65. Combining the Probabilities for Both Events: To find the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening independently.

Event (a) refers to Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President before July 15, 2024. Given that Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election, it is unlikely that he would suddenly reverse his decision and decline the nomination. However, it's not impossible, and there might be unforeseen circumstances that could lead to such an announcement. Event (b) refers to the Republican Party retaining Ohio's 6th congressional district in the 2024 special election. Without knowing the specific candidates, their popularity, and the current political climate in the district, it's challenging to make an informed prediction. However, Ohio's 6th congressional district has historically been a Republican stronghold, and it's possible that the party might retain the seat. Considering both events, I would argue that event (b) is more likely to occur than event (a). However, since the question resolves as YES if either event occurs, we need to consider the combined probability of both events. Given the uncertainty surrounding event (a) and the historical context of event (b), I would estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as low, around 0.1. For event (b), I would estimate the probability as moderate to high, around 0.6.

Event (a): European Union announces new tariffs or duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024. Reasoning: The European Union has been actively engaged in trade negotiations and disputes with China, and the electric vehicle market is a significant sector. Given the ongoing tensions and the EU's efforts to protect its domestic industries, it's plausible that they might impose new tariffs or duties on Chinese electric vehicles. However, the timing is uncertain, and the EU's decision-making process can be slow.

If Trump is removed or blocked from a ballot and then reinstated, such that as of July 15th he is not removed or blocked from any ballot, the question resolves negatively.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-02T02:37:53Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-09-12T21:24:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.8725, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability of this question resolving YES, let's break it down into two parts: (a) Biden remaining President through July 2024 and (b) Trump being removed from any primary election ballot under the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024. For part (a), it's difficult to predict with certainty, but historically, the President of the United States has a relatively low rate of turnover due to resignation, death, or other reasons. As of my knowledge cutoff, there is no indication that Biden plans to resign or is in poor health. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Biden remaining President through July 2024 as relatively high, around 0.8-0.9. For part (b), the 14th Amendment's Section 3, also known as the Disqualification Clause, has been invoked in the past to bar individuals from holding federal office. However, its application to Donald Trump is uncertain and would likely involve complex legal proceedings. Given the political polarization and the fact that Trump has already announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, it's unclear whether any state would successfully remove him from the primary election ballot under the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024. I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as relatively low, around 0.1-0.2. Since the question resolves YES if either condition is met, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A  B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A  B). Assuming independence between the two events, P(A  B) is approximately equal to P(A) \u00d7 P(B). Therefore, the estimated probability of the question resolving YES is: P(YES) = P(Biden remains President) + P(Trump removed from ballot) - P(Biden remains President  Trump removed from ballot) = 0.85 + 0.15 - (0.85 \u00d7 0.15) = 0.85 + 0.15 - 0.1275 = 0.8725"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.014622322936593463, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0036555807341483657, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17728114945538528, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Georgia has qualified 7 times out of 15 attempts since 2007, with their most recent qualification in 2016. Second, we should consider the quality of the songs and artists that both countries have sent in recent years. Czechia has been sending high-quality songs and artists, which has contributed to their recent success. Georgia, on the other hand, has been inconsistent in their song and artist selection, which has affected their qualification chances. Third, we should look at the competition in the Semi-finals. Both Czechia and Georgia will be competing in the same Semi-final, and the competition is expected to be fierce. There are several strong countries in the same Semi-final, including Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, which could make it difficult for both Czechia and Georgia to qualify. Finally, we should consider the voting patterns in the contest. Both Czechia and Georgia have a strong diaspora voting base, which could help them in the voting. However, the voting patterns can be unpredictable, and there is always a risk of a country not qualifying due to low votes. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of both Czechia and Georgia qualifying for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024 is around 0.4.

Current Political Landscape: The Greens\u2013EFA group has been gaining momentum in recent years, particularly among younger voters and in Western European countries. However, the European political landscape is highly fragmented, with many other groups, such as the European People's Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), holding significant sway. 2.

However, they still trailed behind the EPP and S&D groups in terms of overall seats. 3. Upcoming Election Dynamics: The 2024 European Parliament elections will likely see a continued shift towards more environmentally conscious and progressive voting patterns, particularly among younger demographics. However, the outcome is also heavily influenced by national politics, economic conditions, and the ability of various groups to form coalitions. 4. Coalition Dynamics: The Greens\u2013EFA group's ability to form coalitions with other like-minded groups, such as the S&D or liberal groups, could significantly impact their chances of holding the most seats. However, the complexity of forming and maintaining these coalitions adds uncertainty to their prospects. 5. Uncertainty and Volatility: European elections are inherently unpredictable due to the diverse political landscapes across member states. Unexpected events, such as economic crises or significant shifts in public opinion, could alter the electoral landscape in unforeseen ways. Considering these factors, while the Greens\u2013EFA group has a strong potential for growth and could capitalize on the increasing popularity of green policies, the fragmented nature of European politics and the uncertainty of coalition dynamics make it challenging to predict with certainty that they will hold the most seats.

The GUE/NGL (European United Left/Nordic Green Left) and Greens-EFA (The Greens/European Free Alliance) are smaller groups but have been gaining support in recent years due to growing concerns over climate change and social inequality. Given the increasing popularity of green and left-wing politics across Europe, partly due to the climate crisis and economic disparities, there is a plausible argument that these groups could see significant gains. However, the European Parliament's electoral system, which varies by country but often involves proportional representation, tends to favor established parties. Additionally, the political landscape can shift rapidly due to various factors, including changes in public opinion, economic conditions, and the emergence of new political movements or leaders. Despite these challenges, the question does not require either group to surpass the traditional large blocs alone but rather to hold the most seats or be tied for the most.

For event (a), we can look at historical data on Manifold polls and public opinion polls. While public opinion polls consistently show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, every other Democrat hypothetically surveyed polls ahead or within the margin of error. This suggests that Trump's performance may be weaker against a generic Democrat compared to Joe Biden. However, the difference in Trump's performance between the two polls is likely to be small, and a 3% difference is a relatively large margin. Therefore, I estimate the probability of event (a) occurring to be around 0.2. For event (b), we can look at historical exchange rate data between USD and JPY. The current exchange rate is around 130 JPY per USD, and the market is subject to fluctuations based on various economic and geopolitical factors. While it's possible that the exchange rate could reach 145 JPY per USD by August 9th, 2024, it's not a guarantee. I estimate the probability of event (b) occurring to be around 0.3. Since the question asks for the probability of either event (a) or event (b) occurring, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A  B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A  B). Assuming that events (a) and (b) are independent, we can estimate P(A  B) to be around 0.06 (0.2 x 0.3).

There are several factors that support this reasoning. Firstly, major news outlets have a strong network of sources and insiders within the Democratic Party and the Biden administration. It's likely that these sources would provide advance information about a major decision like dropping out of the election. Secondly, news outlets have a strong incentive to break news stories and be the first to report on major developments.

Firstly, Ted Cruz's chances of becoming the Republican nominee depend on various factors, such as his popularity within the party, his performance in the primaries, and the overall political climate. While Cruz has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, his chances of securing the nomination are uncertain and will depend on how the primaries unfold. Secondly, Joe Biden's decision to run for re-election is also uncertain. As the incumbent President, he has not yet officially announced his intention to seek re-election. However, it is common for incumbent Presidents to seek re-election, and Biden has not given any indication that he plans to step down. Given these uncertainties, it is challenging to estimate the probability of both events occurring. However, we can make an educated guess based on current trends and available information. It is worth noting that the Republican primary field is likely to be crowded, with several candidates vying for the nomination. Cruz may face significant competition, which could reduce his chances of securing the nomination. On the other hand, Biden's decision to run for re-election will depend on various factors, including his health, popularity, and the overall political climate. While it is possible that he may decide not to seek re-election, there is currently no indication that he plans to step down. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Ted Cruz becoming the Republican nominee as relatively low, around 0.2. The probability of Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination is also relatively low, around 0.3.

Component 1: Ted Cruz becoming the Republican nominee. As of my knowledge cutoff, the 2024 US Presidential Election is still over two years away, and the Republican primary field is not yet set. While Ted Cruz has run for president before and may consider another bid, it's difficult to predict with certainty who will emerge as the nominee. However, we can look at some general trends and facts: Incumbent presidents often face primary challenges, but it's rare for a sitting president to lose their party's nomination. The Republican Party has a history of nominating establishment candidates, although there have been exceptions (e.g., Donald Trump in 2016). Ted Cruz has a dedicated base of supporters, but his national popularity and electability are uncertain. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Ted Cruz becoming the Republican nominee as relatively low, around 10-20%. This is because the field is still wide open, and other candidates may emerge with stronger support. Component 2: Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the Democratic nomination. As of my knowledge cutoff, Joe Biden has not indicated any intention to step down or decline the Democratic nomination. In fact, he has expressed interest in running for re-election. While it's possible that Biden's plans could change due to various factors (e.g., health concerns, political calculations), there is currently no clear indication that he will decline the nomination. Given this, I'd estimate the probability of Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the Democratic nomination as very low, around 5-10%. This is because there is no strong evidence to suggest he will decline the nomination, and incumbent presidents often seek re-election. Combined probability: To estimate the overall probability of the question resolving YES, we need to consider the probability of either event occurring. Since these events are mutually exclusive, we can add the probabilities: Probability of Ted Cruz becoming the Republican nominee: 15%. Probability of Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the Democratic nomination: 7.5%. Combined probability: 15% + 7.5% = 22.5%. Reasoning: Given the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 US Presidential Election and the lack of clear indications that either event will occur, I estimate the probability of the question resolving YES as relatively low.

Reasoning: Chris Christie is a well-known figure in the Republican Party, having served as Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018. However, his popularity has waxed and waned over the years, and he has not been as prominent in recent years. While he has not officially announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, he has not ruled it out either.

However, given his experience and name recognition, it's not impossible that he could emerge as the nominee. Probability: 0.2 (20%) Event (b): Biden drops out before July 13, 2024. Reasoning: President Biden has not indicated any intention to drop out of the 2024 presidential election. In fact, he has stated his intention to run for re-election. While it's impossible to predict the future with certainty, there is no credible evidence to suggest that he will drop out before July 13, 2024. Therefore, this event seems unlikely.

While it's possible that Biden might decide not to run for re-election, there is no strong indication that he will make such an announcement before the specified date. In fact, Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. Therefore, the likelihood of scenario (a) occurring seems low. Scenario (b) involves Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024. The current situation in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, and it's difficult to forecast the outcome of the conflict. However, as of the current date (April 25, 2024), there is no indication that Russia has control of Chasiv Yar. The ISW map, which is used to track the conflict, does not show Russian control of the location. While it's possible that the situation could change in the next few weeks, it's also possible that Ukraine will maintain control of the area or that the conflict will be ongoing with no clear victor. Therefore, the likelihood of scenario (b) occurring is also uncertain. Given the uncertainty surrounding both scenarios, it's difficult to estimate a high probability of either scenario occurring. However, since the question only requires one of the scenarios to occur for it to resolve YES, we need to consider the combined probability of both scenarios. Assuming that the probability of scenario (a) occurring is low (around 10-20%), and the probability of scenario (b) occurring is uncertain (around 30-40%), the combined probability of either scenario occurring can be estimated using the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since the scenarios are independent, P(A and B) is approximately 0.

Additionally, the index tends to be higher during the summer months, which could also contribute to an increase in the VXVCLS index. However, it's also important to note that the VXVCLS index can be highly unpredictable and is influenced by a wide range of factors, including market sentiment, economic data, and geopolitical events. Therefore, it's difficult to make a precise prediction about the index's future direction. Overall, based on the current trends and market conditions, I believe that there is a moderate chance that the VXVCLS index will be higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024.

Legal Basis: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The application of this clause to Donald Trump would depend on legal interpretations and actions taken by state governments or courts. 2.

For event (a), we would need more information about the current number of traders in the linked market and its growth rate to make an informed estimate.

For event (b), ISS is a influential proxy advisory firm that often advises shareholders on how to vote on executive compensation packages and board elections.

(a) Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4: This event requires a formal declaration by the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet that the President is unable to discharge his duties. Given the current information available, there is no indication that Biden's health is deteriorating to the point where such a declaration would be necessary. Additionally, invoking the 25th Amendment is a significant step that would likely face intense scrutiny and potential opposition. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring before August 2024 seems relatively low. (b) Joe Biden dies: Estimating the probability of a person's death within a specific timeframe is challenging, especially without access to the individual's medical records or information about their current health status. However, we can consider some general factors. Joe Biden is 81 years old, which is considered advanced age. According to the Social Security Administration's Actuarial Life Table, the probability of a person dying within the next year at age 81 is around 7-8%. However, this is a general statistic and does not take into account Biden's individual health status or other factors that might influence his mortality risk. Combining the probabilities of these two events, we can assume that the probability of either event occurring before August 2024 is slightly higher than the probability of Joe Biden dying, given the extremely low likelihood of the 25th Amendment being invoked."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.013912255743627228, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.003478063935906807, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1749992708378906, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For event (a), it's difficult to predict with certainty how many world records will be broken, as it depends on various factors such as the performance of athletes, technological advancements, and competition dynamics. However, we can look at historical data to get an idea of the average number of world records broken at previous Olympics. According to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), an average of around 20-25 world records are broken at each Summer Olympics. Given that the 2024 Paris Olympics will feature new events and potentially improved athletic performances, it's reasonable to assume that at least 24 world records could be broken. For event (b), France's performance at the Olympics can be evaluated based on their past medal counts. According to the IOC, France has consistently ranked among the top 10 countries in the overall medal count at the Summer Olympics since 1992. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, France ranked 8th in the overall medal count. Considering the home advantage and the investment in French sports infrastructure and training programs, it's plausible that France could place in the top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Given the uncertainty surrounding both events, it's challenging to assign a precise probability. However, considering the historical data and the factors mentioned above, I would estimate the probability of at least 24 world records being broken as 0.6 and the probability of France placing in the top 5 as 0.4. Since the question resolves YES if either event occurs, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Assuming independence between the two events, P(A \u2229 B) is approximately 0.24 (0.6 \u00d7 0.4).

The second event is the US government ending its agreement with Verisign for the .com TLD before August 3, 2024. To estimate the probability of either of these events occurring, we need to consider the likelihood of each event individually and then combine them. For the first event, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Joe Biden will announce that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President. However, based on historical trends and current political climate, it seems unlikely that he would make such an announcement before the deadline. For the second event, the US government ending its agreement with Verisign for the .com TLD, it is also difficult to predict with certainty. However, considering the long-standing relationship between the US government and Verisign, and the fact that the agreement has been renewed several times in the past, it seems unlikely that the US government would terminate the agreement before the deadline. Given the uncertainty surrounding both events, it is reasonable to assign a low probability to each event occurring individually. However, since the question is asking about the probability of either event occurring, we need to combine the probabilities. Assuming independence between the two events, the probability of either event occurring is the sum of the individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring together (to avoid double counting). Since we are not given any information about the correlation between the two events, we will assume independence for simplicity. Let's assign a probability of 0.1 to the first event (Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President) and a probability of 0.05 to the second event (the US government ending its agreement with Verisign for the .com TLD).

Historically, the Month-over-Month changes in the Core CPI have been relatively small, usually ranging from -0.1% to 0.3%. Given this range, an increase of more than 0.1% is plausible but not guaranteed. Recent economic trends, such as inflation rates and employment numbers, can also influence the Core CPI.

However, it's difficult to predict with certainty what the polling average will be on July 15, 2024.

Let's assume a mean of 0 (i.e., a tied race) and a standard deviation of 2 (a rough estimate based on historical polling variability). Using a normal distribution calculator, we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being between 2 and 4 as approximately 0.1359 (i.e., the area under the curve between 2 and 4).

For part (a), I'll consider the historical volatility of presidential election polling averages. In the 2020 election, the polling average lead fluctuated significantly over time, with Biden's lead ranging from around 2 to 10 points at various points. Given the current date (July 2024), there is still plenty of time for the polling average to shift. However, it's unlikely that Trump will gain a significant lead, as the election is still several months away, and many factors can influence voter opinions. I'll assume a relatively stable polling average, with some fluctuations. The probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, seems moderate, around 20-30%. For part (b), I'll consider the growth rate of the linked market. The market currently has an unknown number of traders (as I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to the market data).

Donald Trump Jr. is the son of former US President Donald Trump and has been involved in politics, but he has not held public office. The Republican National Convention typically selects the nominee through a delegate voting process. Historically, the Republican Party has tended to nominate candidates with more traditional political experience, such as governors or senators. However, the party has also shown a willingness to nominate outsiders, as seen with Donald Trump's nomination in 2016. Given the current political landscape and the fact that Donald Trump Jr. has not yet announced a presidential bid, it's challenging to assess his chances. However, I can consider some factors that might influence his potential nomination. Firstly, name recognition and the Trump brand are significant advantages in Republican politics. Donald Trump Jr. has been an outspoken supporter of his father and has built a reputation among some Republican voters. Secondly, the Republican Party has undergone significant changes since the 2016 election, with a growing populist and nationalist wing that might be receptive to a Trump-like candidate. However, it's essential to note that the nomination process is highly uncertain and influenced by various factors, including the candidate's performance in primary debates, fundraising, and grassroots support.

However, there are a few factors to consider that might reduce the likelihood of this happening. Firstly, publishing the results of external red-teaming might require significant resources and effort, including coordinating with external parties, reviewing the results, and preparing a report. Secondly, Google DeepMind might be hesitant to publish results that could potentially reveal vulnerabilities in their models.

Slovenia, on the other hand, has not had as much success, with only a few top 10 finishes since the introduction of the semi-final system in 2004.

Given the unpredictability of the contest and the fact that both countries have a chance to send a competitive entry, it's difficult to estimate their chances with high precision. However, based on their past performances, I would argue that Malta has a slightly higher chance of qualifying than Slovenia.

Since the question asks about either Malta or Slovenia qualifying, we need to calculate the probability that at least one of them qualifies. This can be done by subtracting the probability that neither of them qualifies from 1.

For event (a), the ICC has been investigating alleged war crimes in Palestine since 2019, and there have been reports of possible arrest warrants for Israeli officials. However, the ICC's investigation and decision-making process can be slow and unpredictable. Given the timeframe of July 1, 2024, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether the ICC will issue arrest warrants for the specified Israeli leaders.

For event (a), while Tim Scott is a potential candidate, the Republican nomination process is highly uncertain and competitive. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, other prominent candidates like Donald Trump and Nikki Haley had already announced their intentions to run. Without more recent information, it's difficult to assess Scott's chances accurately. However, given the competitive nature of the nomination process, I would estimate Scott's chances of becoming the nominee as relatively low, around 10-20%. For event (b), forecasting the outcome of the presidential election is inherently uncertain, especially over a year in advance. However, FiveThirtyEight's election forecast models have a strong track record of predicting election outcomes. As of my knowledge cutoff, Biden's approval ratings were around 40-45%, which is relatively low for an incumbent president. However, the election is still over a year away, and many factors can influence the outcome. Given these uncertainties, it's difficult to estimate the probability of Biden being projected as the favorite by FiveThirtyEight on July 19, 2024. However, assuming that the election will be highly competitive, I would estimate the probability of Biden being projected as the favorite as around 40-50%. Since the question resolves YES if either event occurs, we need to estimate the probability of at least one of these events happening. Assuming independence between the two events (which may not be the case in reality), we can estimate the probability of at least one event occurring as 1 - (probability of neither event occurring). Let's assume the probability of Scott becoming the nominee is 15% and the probability of Biden being projected as the favorite is 45%. Then, the probability of neither event occurring is (1 - 0.15) * (1 - 0.45) = 0.6375. Therefore, the probability of at least one event occurring is 1 - 0.6375 = 0.3625.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update in early 2023, the European Parliament's composition reflects a diverse political landscape with several major groups, including the European People's Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), Renew Europe, the Greens\u2013EFA, and the GUE/NGL, among others. The Greens\u2013EFA and GUE/NGL, while significant, have not historically held the majority of seats. 2. Historical Performance: Historically, the Greens\u2013EFA and GUE/NGL have not been the largest groups in the European Parliament. The EPP and S&D have traditionally held the most seats, though the political landscape has become increasingly fragmented. 3. Electoral Trends: European elections often reflect national trends, and the popularity of green and left-wing parties has been increasing in some member states. However, this growth is not uniform across the EU, and other parties also show resilience and strength in different regions. 4. Coalition Dynamics: The European Parliament often operates through coalitions. While the Greens\u2013EFA and GUE/NGL might gain seats, forming a coalition to hold the most seats together would be unprecedented and challenging, given their differing ideologies and the presence of other significant groups. 5. Forecasting Challenges: Predicting electoral outcomes, especially at the European level, is inherently uncertain due to factors like national political trends, voter turnout, and the complex system of proportional representation used across different countries. Given these considerations, the scenario of both the Greens\u2013EFA and GUE/NGL holding the most seats seems unlikely. While it's plausible that these groups could increase their representation and play a crucial role in coalition-building, surpassing the traditional major groups to jointly hold the most seats is a high bar."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "96db088c-438a-436a-bd35-5ee4afc28132", "title": "Will either the Greens\u2013EFA or GUE/NGL hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either the Greens\u2013EFA or the GUE/NGL political group holds the most seats after the 2024 European Parliament elections.

Given the uncertainty and the time remaining before the resolution date (July 17, 2024), it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, we can consider the following: 1. Historical context: In recent presidential elections, polling averages have often been within a few percentage points of the actual outcome. However, there have been instances where the polling average was off by more than 2-3 percentage points. 2. Current polling trends: As of the question's creation date, the polling average on FiveThirtyEight shows a relatively close race, with Trump leading by around 2-3 percentage points. However, this can change rapidly. 3.

To estimate the probability of the first event, we need to consider the historical trends and volatility of presidential election polling. While it's difficult to predict the exact polling numbers, we can look at the general trends and the fact that polling averages tend to be relatively stable in the months leading up to the election. Assuming that the polling average will continue to fluctuate within a reasonable range, the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, seems relatively low, as it requires a specific and narrow range of values. Regarding the second event, the outcome of the European Parliament elections is inherently uncertain and influenced by various factors, including national politics, voter turnout, and coalition dynamics. While the Greens-EFA group has been gaining momentum in recent years, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether they will hold the most seats after the 2024 elections.

Polling averages can fluctuate significantly due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, candidate strategies, and external events. Given the time frame of over a year before the resolution date, there is substantial uncertainty in the polling numbers. However, we can make an educated guess based on the typical range of polling averages and the historical volatility of such numbers.

A lead of greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points is a relatively narrow range, especially considering the margin of error in polling and the potential for significant events to sway public opinion.

This requires the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to invoke Section 4, declaring that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. To assess the likelihood of this event, let's consider the following factors: 1. Precedent: The 25th Amendment has been invoked only a handful of times in U.S. history, and never for the purpose of declaring a President incapacitated. This suggests that such an event is rare and typically requires extraordinary circumstances. 2. Current political climate: The fact that a GOP lawmaker has asked Merrick Garland to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Biden from office indicates that there is some political pressure to do so. However, it's essential to note that this is likely a partisan move, and the Vice President and Cabinet may not be inclined to take such a drastic step without clear evidence of incapacitation. 3. Biden's health: While President Biden's age and health have been subjects of public concern, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that he is currently incapacitated or unable to perform his duties. 4. Procedural hurdles: Invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment requires a formal declaration by the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet.

To estimate the probability of this event, we need to consider the historical context, current political climate, and potential incentives for such an alliance. Historically, the Republicans Party and National Rally have been on opposite sides of the political spectrum, with the former being a mainstream center-right party and the latter being a far-right party. However, in recent years, there have been instances of cooperation and convergence between the two parties on certain issues. In the current political climate, both parties face significant challenges. The Republicans Party has been struggling to regain its footing after a series of electoral defeats, while National Rally has been trying to expand its appeal beyond its core base. An alliance could potentially benefit both parties by combining their strengths and increasing their chances of winning seats in the legislative election. However, there are also significant obstacles to such an alliance. The Republicans Party has traditionally been wary of National Rally's far-right ideology, and many of its members may be hesitant to form an alliance with a party that has been associated with extremist views. Additionally, National Rally's leader, Marine Le Pen, has been a polarizing figure in French politics, and an alliance with her party could alienate some of the Republicans Party's more moderate voters. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of an electoral alliance or coalition agreement between the Republicans Party and National Rally for the 2024 French legislative election as follows: Probability: 0.25. This probability reflects the uncertainty and complexity of the situation, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of such an alliance for both parties. While there are valid reasons to believe that an alliance could be beneficial, the historical and ideological differences between the two parties make it a challenging and unlikely outcome."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "5093d30e-e875-4272-8bb5-99b25890d2fd", "title": "Will the Prime Minister of France belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as Yes if the party of the Prime Minister of France is Together on July 30th, at 12:00 Central European Time, according to credible sources.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-31T11:13:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-06-13T16:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.8, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "The current Prime Minister of France is \u00c9lisabeth Borne, who is a member of the Renaissance party, which is part of the Ensemble coalition (also known as the Together coalition).

Event 1: The 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee is a Woman. Given the current political landscape and the increasing presence of women in leadership roles, there is a reasonable chance that the Democratic Party might nominate a woman for the presidency. However, without knowing the specific candidates or the dynamics of the primary elections, it's challenging to provide a precise estimate. Historically, the Democratic Party has been more likely to nominate women for high-level positions, but the nomination process is inherently unpredictable. A moderate probability seems appropriate. Event 2: The same nation wins more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics. In the Olympics, the distribution of talent and success across different sports and nations can be quite dispersed. However, certain countries consistently perform well across multiple sports due to their strong sporting cultures, investment in sports infrastructure, and talent development programs. The United States, China, and a few European nations often dominate various Olympic sports. Given the variety of sports involved and the depth of talent in these countries, it's plausible that at least one nation could win more than one women's team sport. This event seems more likely than not. Combining the Probabilities: To estimate the combined probability of both events occurring, we need to consider their independence. The outcome of the Democratic presidential nomination and the Olympic sports events are unrelated, so we can multiply their individual probabilities. Assuming a moderate probability for Event 1 (0.4) and a higher probability for Event 2 (0.6), the combined probability would be: 0.4 (Event 1) \u00d7 0.6 (Event 2) = 0.24.

Event (a) involves at least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early. The context from Politico suggests that there is already a drafted letter circulating among House Democrats, and Rep. Jared Huffman has expressed strong opposition to the plan. This indicates that there is a significant level of discontent among Democrats regarding Biden's candidacy. However, it's unclear how many Democrats will ultimately sign the letter, and it's possible that some may not want to publicly oppose the party's plan. Given the existing opposition and the fact that only 20 signatures are needed, I estimate the probability of event (a) occurring at around 0.6. Event (b) involves the Democrats having a brokered convention in 2024, which requires more than one round of voting in the roll call ballot to formally nominate their candidate. A brokered convention is often a sign of a deeply divided party, and the current opposition to Biden's candidacy could contribute to such a scenario. However, it's also possible that the party will rally around Biden or another candidate before the convention, avoiding a brokered convention. Given the current level of opposition and the fact that the convention is still several months away, I estimate the probability of event (b) occurring at around 0.4. Since the two events are related but distinct, we can assume some level of correlation between them. If event (a) occurs, it could indicate a higher level of opposition to Biden's candidacy, which might increase the likelihood of event (b) occurring. However, the correlation is not perfect, as a brokered convention could still occur even if fewer than 20 Democrats sign the letter. To account for this correlation, we can use a rough estimate of the joint probability, assuming a moderate level of correlation (e.g., 0.2-0.3). This would put the joint probability at around 0.24-0.28. However, since we are looking for the probability of both events occurring, we should take the lower end of this range to be conservative."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "70d191b6-4b44-4d0f-a704-d0a3dd3525af", "title": "Will either at least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early, or will Democrats have a brokered convention in 2024?", "body": "(a) At least 20 House Members or Senators who caucus with the Democratic Party sign a public letter opposing the early nomination plan before market close at the end of Sunday, July 21st.

To estimate the probability of this question resolving YES, let's analyze each scenario separately. Scenario (a) depends on the actions of at least 20 House Members or Senators who caucus with the Democratic Party. Given the current political climate and the fact that Joe Biden is the incumbent president, it's likely that most Democrats will support his nomination. However, there might be some opposition, especially from progressive Democrats who might disagree with Biden's policies or want to see a more diverse ticket. While it's possible that at least 20 Democrats might sign a public letter opposing the early nomination plan, it's not a guarantee. The deadline for this scenario is Sunday, July 21st, which is relatively close to the creation date of this question (July 8th). This time constraint might limit the likelihood of this scenario occurring. Scenario (b) depends on the outcome of the Democratic Party's roll call ballot. A brokered convention is typically a rare occurrence, and it usually happens when no candidate has a clear majority of delegates. Given Biden's current popularity and the fact that he's the incumbent president, it's likely that he will have a significant number of delegates. However, it's not impossible that other candidates might gain traction and split the delegate count, leading to a brokered convention. Considering both scenarios, I believe that scenario (b) is less likely to occur than scenario (a). A brokered convention is a rare event, and Biden's current popularity makes it less likely. On the other hand, scenario (a) is more plausible, as there might be some opposition to Biden's nomination from within the Democratic Party. However, the time constraint and the fact that most Democrats will likely support Biden's nomination make it less likely than a coin flip."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06024568316359463, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.015061420790898658, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.35080355226716686, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This is not a decision that would be taken lightly, and it would likely require a severe and incapacitating medical condition or a significant cognitive decline that renders the President unable to perform his duties. As of the current date (July 2024), there is no publicly available information suggesting that President Biden is facing a severe medical crisis or cognitive decline that would warrant such a declaration.

Furthermore, the political context also suggests that invoking the 25th Amendment Section 4 is unlikely. The Vice President and the Cabinet are unlikely to take such a drastic step without broad bipartisan support, which is currently lacking.

Given the lack of specific information about current market conditions, trends, or forecasts, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. However, we can consider a few general points: 1. Market Volatility: Stock markets are inherently volatile, and the BSE SENSEX, being a key index of the Indian stock market, is no exception. Its value can fluctuate based on a wide range of factors including economic indicators, political stability, global market trends, and more. 2. Historical Performance: Without current data, we can't assess the recent performance of the BSE SENSEX or its historical highs and lows around the specified date range. Typically, stock market indices can experience significant swings over a four-year period, making long-term predictions challenging. 3. Forecasting Difficulty: Predicting stock market movements, especially for a specific date, is notoriously difficult. Many factors, including unforeseen events, can influence the market.

First, let's consider the probability of Donald Trump being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, Donald Trump has announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, but the outcome of the Republican National Convention is uncertain. Several factors can influence the convention's decision, including Trump's popularity, the performance of other candidates, and potential party dynamics. While Trump has a significant following and has been a dominant figure in the Republican Party, it's difficult to predict the outcome of the convention with certainty. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Donald Trump being selected as the Republican nominee as around 0.6 (or 60%). Now, let's examine the probability of the closing value of BSE SENSEX being greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000 on July 21, 2024. Predicting stock market values is inherently challenging, as it depends on various economic and market factors. However, we can look at historical trends and current market conditions to make an educated estimate. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the BSE SENSEX has been steadily increasing, but it's difficult to predict its exact value on a specific date. Considering the historical volatility of the market and the uncertainty surrounding future events, I would estimate the probability of the BSE SENSEX closing within the specified range on July 21, 2024, as around 0.2 (or 20%). To calculate the probability of both events occurring, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event. Assuming independence between the two events, the combined probability would be: 0.6 (Trump being selected as the Republican nominee) \u00d7 0.2 (BSE SENSEX closing within the specified range) = 0.12.

For part (a), we can look at historical trends and current political climate. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, we can consider the following factors: Donald Trump's popularity within the Republican party, the lack of a clear alternative candidate, and the Trump family's involvement in politics. Given these factors, it's plausible that a member of the Trump family could be the Republican nominee in 2024.

For part (a), while it's difficult to predict with certainty, we can consider the current political landscape and the popularity of Trump family members. Donald Trump has already announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, and his family members have been involved in politics to varying degrees. However, it's essential to note that the Republican primary process can be unpredictable, and other candidates may emerge as strong contenders.

Historically, Iran and Israel have had a complex and tense relationship, with periods of heightened tensions and proxy conflicts. However, direct military confrontations between the two nations have been relatively rare. In recent years, there have been reports of Iranian military activities in Syria, which have led to Israeli airstrikes against Iranian targets. Nevertheless, these incidents have not escalated into a full-scale war. Given the current geopolitical landscape, there are several factors to consider: 1. Iran's nuclear program: The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) has been in a state of limbo since the US withdrawal in 2018. Iran has been gradually increasing its uranium enrichment, which has raised concerns among Western nations. However, this does not necessarily imply an imminent military conflict with Israel. 2. Israeli military preparedness: Israel has been actively preparing for potential conflicts with Iran, including conducting military exercises and deploying defense systems. This suggests that Israel is taking the threat seriously, but it does not necessarily indicate an increased likelihood of an Iranian attack. 3. Regional dynamics: The Middle East is a complex and volatile region, with various actors and interests at play. While there have been reports of Iranian military activities in Syria and Yemen, these do not directly imply an increased likelihood of an attack on Israeli soil. 4. Diplomatic efforts: There have been ongoing diplomatic efforts to revive the JCPOA, and some countries, like the US, have expressed a willingness to re-enter the agreement. This could potentially reduce tensions between Iran and the West, including Israel. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Iran initiating a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory between July 30 and August 12, 2024, as relatively low.

(a) Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of my last update in April 2023, Francis Suarez, the Mayor of Miami, has announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. However, the field for the Republican nomination is highly competitive, with other prominent candidates like Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, and others. Suarez's chances depend on various factors, including his campaign's performance, fundraising, debate performances, and how the primary and caucus season unfolds. Given the competition and the fluid nature of primary elections, it's challenging to assign a precise probability. However, Suarez is considered a long-shot candidate at this stage. (b) 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20: As of my last update in April 2023, there has been no significant movement among Democratic Senators calling for President Biden to drop out of the race. The Democratic Party has generally rallied around Biden, and there's been no major public dissent. The likelihood of this scenario would significantly increase if there were a major scandal, severe health issue, or a dramatic decline in Biden's approval ratings among Democrats. However, predicting such events is inherently difficult. Given these considerations, let's assign rough probabilities: Probability of Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee: 5% (considering the competitive field and his current status as a long-shot candidate) Probability of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20: 2% (given the current political climate and lack of significant dissent within the Democratic Party) To combine these probabilities (assuming they are independent events), we calculate the probability that neither event occurs and subtract that from 1: Probability of neither event occurring = (1 - 0.05) * (1 - 0.02) = 0.95 * 0.98 = 0.931 Probability of either event occurring = 1 - Probability of neither event occurring = 1 - 0.931 = 0.069.

Moldova has had some success in Eurovision, with a few top 10 finishes in the past decade, including a 3rd place finish in 2017. However, their qualification rate is not perfect, and they have failed to qualify for the Grand Final a few times. Australia, on the other hand, has been a consistent qualifier since their debut in 2015, with a few top 10 finishes, including a 2nd place finish in 2016. However, their qualification is not guaranteed, and they have faced increased competition in recent years. Given the competitiveness of Eurovision and the unpredictability of the voting, it's difficult to estimate the exact probability of either country qualifying. However, based on their past performances, I would say that Australia has a slightly higher chance of qualifying than Moldova. Assuming that both countries participate in a Semi-final, I would estimate the probability of Australia qualifying as around 0.7-0.8, and the probability of Moldova qualifying as around 0.5-0.6. Since the question asks for the probability of either country qualifying, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of them qualifying.

(a) Meta publishes a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024: Meta, being a major player in the tech industry, especially in AI development, has shown a commitment to AI safety through various initiatives. However, the specific requirement of publishing a report from external red-teaming by a certain deadline introduces some uncertainty. External red-teaming is a thorough process, and depending on its scope, it might take significant time to conduct and compile into a publishable report. Given Meta's resources and the growing importance of AI safety, it's plausible they could meet this deadline, especially since the question doesn't specify the model or the scope of the red-teaming. However, the specificity of the deadline (June 30, 2024) and the requirement for it to be a public report add to the challenge. Considering the factors above, I would estimate the probability of Meta publishing such a report by June 30, 2024, as moderate to high, around 0.7. (b) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, 2024: The success of a market or a prediction platform often depends on various factors including but not limited to the relevance of the questions asked, the user interface, marketing efforts, and the overall interest in the topics covered by the market. Without specific details about the market's current performance, its growth rate, or the strategies in place to attract traders, it's challenging to accurately predict its success. However, reaching a specific number of traders (377) by a certain date is a tangible goal that can be influenced by targeted marketing and engagement strategies. Given the lack of detailed information about the market's current state and growth prospects, and considering the specificity of the goal (at least 377 traders by July 15, 2024), I would estimate this probability as somewhat lower than Condition (a), around 0.55. To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening. Probability of both conditions being met = Probability of (a) * Probability of (b). Given the estimated probabilities: Probability of (a) = 0.7, Probability of (b) = 0.55. Probability of both conditions being met = 0.7 * 0.55 = 0.385. Both conditions require specific outcomes by certain deadlines, with factors such as Meta's commitment to AI safety and the growth dynamics of the linked market influencing their probabilities.

For event (a), we need to analyze the polling data from Manifold. However, without access to the specific polling data or historical trends, it's challenging to make an informed estimate. Nevertheless, it's reasonable to assume that the difference in Trump's performance between the two polls might be relatively small, given that the polls are identical except for the opponent. A 3% difference seems like a notable shift, but without more information, it's difficult to assign a precise probability. For event (b), the likelihood of a group of at least 5 named Democratic House Members or Senators pressuring Biden to drop out before July 20th appears low.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The clause has been invoked in discussions about Trump's eligibility due to his role in the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. To assess the probability of Trump being removed or blocked under this clause, several factors come into play: 1. Legal and Political Challenges: The application of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to Trump's situation is unprecedented in modern times and would likely face significant legal and political challenges. Any attempt to remove him from the ballot would need to navigate through state and possibly federal courts, which could be time-consuming and contentious. 2. State-Level Actions: The question's resolution depends on actions taken at the state level. Given the political polarization in the U.S., it's plausible that some states might attempt to invoke Section 3 against Trump, but the success of such attempts is uncertain. 3. Timeframe: The question specifies that the removal or block must be confirmed by July 15, 2024. Given the potential for legal challenges and the time required for court proceedings, the timeframe is relatively tight. 4. Precedent and Legal Interpretation: The legal interpretation of Section 3 and its application to Trump's situation is not straightforward. Courts would need to establish a precedent for its use in this context, which adds to the uncertainty. Given these considerations, while there is a plausible scenario in which Trump could be removed or blocked from a state's primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the legal, political, and temporal hurdles suggest that the likelihood is not high."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "909cd1e0-2482-4470-a9e2-b8378f56a356", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Elon Musk will show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, and (b) Donald Trump will be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n(b) On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the current trade relationship between the EU and China, as well as any recent developments or trends that may indicate a shift in trade policies. Firstly, the EU has been actively promoting the development of its own electric vehicle industry, and has implemented various incentives and regulations to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles within the region. This suggests that the EU may be motivated to protect its domestic industry from external competition, potentially through the imposition of tariffs or duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Secondly, there have been ongoing trade tensions between the EU and China in recent years, with both sides imposing tariffs on each other's goods. This history of trade tensions increases the likelihood of the EU imposing new tariffs or duties on Chinese electric vehicles. Thirdly, the EU has been actively monitoring the Chinese electric vehicle market and has expressed concerns about the potential impact of cheap Chinese imports on the EU's domestic industry. This suggests that the EU may be considering measures to protect its industry, including the imposition of tariffs or duties. However, it's worth noting that the EU has also been trying to maintain a good trade relationship with China, and may be hesitant to impose new tariffs or duties that could escalate trade tensions. Additionally, the EU has a complex decision-making process, and any decision to impose new tariffs or duties would need to be agreed upon by all member states. Overall, considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the European Union announcing new tariffs or duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024, to be around 60%. This reflects the potential motivations for the EU to protect its domestic industry, as well as the ongoing trade tensions between the EU and China.

(a) Disney announcing a new Moana-themed ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024: Disney has a history of announcing new attractions and experiences at D23 conventions. Moana is a popular franchise, and a themed ride would likely be well-received by fans. However, there has been no official confirmation or strong rumors about a Moana ride coming to Magic Kingdom. Given the lack of concrete evidence, I'd estimate the probability of this event occurring at around 20-30%. (b) Deadpool & Wolverine having the biggest opening weekend ever for an R-rated movie: The original Deadpool had a massive opening weekend, and the addition of Wolverine could potentially draw in more fans. The Marvel brand is extremely popular, and the hype around this movie is likely to be significant. However, the movie industry is unpredictable, and many factors can influence a film's box office performance. Considering the success of previous Marvel movies and the popularity of the characters involved, I'd estimate the probability of this event occurring at around 40-50%. Since the question resolves YES if either of these conditions is met, I'll use the probability of the union of these two events. Assuming independence, the probability of at least one of the events occurring is 1 - (probability of neither event occurring).

For event (a), the Greens\u2013EFA is a political group in the European Parliament, and their performance in the 2024 elections is uncertain.

First, we note that polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, external events, and differences in polling methodologies. However, 538's national polling average is a reliable aggregator of polls, providing a comprehensive view of the electoral landscape. Given the current date is June 1, 2024, we are about 6 weeks away from the specified date of July 15, 2024. In the context of presidential elections, 6 weeks is a relatively short period, and polling numbers can shift substantially during this time. Historically, polling margins of 2-3 points are relatively common in presidential elections, and it's plausible that Trump's lead could fall within this range on July 15, 2024. However, predicting the exact margin is challenging, if not impossible, due to the inherent uncertainty in polling data. To make an informed estimate, let's consider the following: The polling average can fluctuate by around 1-2 points over a 6-week period due to random noise and changes in voter sentiment. There is a roughly equal chance of the polling average increasing or decreasing over this period. The probability of the polling average remaining exactly within the 2-3 point range is lower than the probability of it being outside this range, given the inherent volatility of polling data. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, to be around 20%.

(a) Assessing Trump's lead over Biden: As of the question's creation date (June 1, 2024), the 2024 presidential election is still over a year away. It's challenging to predict the polling average this far in advance, as many factors can influence public opinion. However, we can look at historical trends and the current political landscape. In recent years, presidential election polls have often been volatile, with leads changing hands several times before the election. Given the uncertainty, it's difficult to predict a specific range for Trump's lead. Nevertheless, assuming a relatively stable polling environment, a lead of 2-3 points is plausible but not extremely likely. (b) Assessing Nvidia's market capitalization: As of the question's creation date (June 1, 2024), Nvidia's market capitalization is around $925 billion, while Apple's is approximately $2.35 trillion. For Nvidia's market capitalization to surpass Apple's, it would need to more than double, which is unlikely in a short period (about a month). While Nvidia has been growing rapidly, Apple's market capitalization is substantial, and such a significant shift in a short time frame is improbable. Considering both events, it's essential to note that they are independent, and the occurrence of one does not directly influence the other. To estimate the probability of both events occurring, we need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event. Assuming a relatively stable polling environment, the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, is around 0.15 (15%). This is a rough estimate, as predicting polling averages this far in advance is challenging. The probability of Nvidia's market capitalization being larger than Apple's on June 28th, 2024, is around 0.05 (5%). This is a conservative estimate, considering the significant gap between their current market capitalizations.

Israel has been concerned about Iran's nuclear program and its support for militant groups in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. However, it's crucial to note that Israel has not carried out a large-scale attack within Iran's borders in recent years. While there have been reports of Israeli airstrikes against Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, these have been relatively limited in scope. Given the current situation, it's possible that Israel might consider a more significant attack within Iran if it perceives a significant threat to its national security. However, such an attack would likely have severe consequences, including potential retaliation from Iran and its allies, as well as international condemnation. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, as relatively low.

Historical Context: Israel has a history of conducting military operations against targets it perceives as threats, including within Iran. Notable examples include the alleged involvement in the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and airstrikes against Iranian military assets in Syria. 2. Current Tensions: The question implies a heightened state of tension between Israel and Iran, which is consistent with recent geopolitical trends. Both countries have engaged in a shadow war, with Israel expressing concerns over Iran's nuclear program and Iran accusing Israel of sabotage and espionage. 3.

This capability suggests that Israel has the means to carry out an attack within Iran if it chooses to do so. 4. International Context: The international community's stance, including that of major powers like the United States, Russia, and European nations, could influence Israel's decision-making. However, predicting how these factors will align or impact Israel's actions is complex. 5. Risk of Escalation: Any attack by Israel within Iran risks significant escalation, potentially drawing in other regional actors and major powers. This risk might deter Israel from taking such action unless it perceives a significant and immediate threat.

The field for the Republican nomination is typically crowded, and the process is highly competitive and unpredictable. Haley's chances depend on various factors, including her campaign's performance, fundraising, debates, and voter sentiment. Given the early stage of the race and the fluid nature of political landscapes, it's challenging to assign a high probability to any single candidate securing the nomination.

However, it's essential to note that polling numbers can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as campaign events, debates, and external events. Historically, presidential election polls have shown considerable volatility, especially during the summer months before the election.

Firstly, the number of gold medals won by Individual Neutral Athletes in previous Olympics can provide a baseline for our estimate. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), which competed under the Olympic flag as neutral athletes, won a total of 20 gold medals. However, it's essential to note that the ROC was not the only group of Individual Neutral Athletes competing in the Olympics, and other athletes may have also competed under the Olympic flag. Secondly, we need to consider the overall competitiveness of the Olympics and the distribution of gold medals among participating countries. Historically, the top 5-6 countries tend to dominate the medal count, with the United States, China, and Russia being among the most successful. However, the Olympics also feature many events where smaller countries or individual athletes can win gold medals. Lastly, we should consider the uncertainty surrounding the participation and performance of Individual Neutral Athletes in the Paris 2024 Olympics. The number of athletes competing under the Olympic flag can vary from one Olympics to another, and their performance can be affected by various factors such as training, injuries, and team dynamics. Taking these factors into account, it's challenging to make a precise estimate.

Condition 1: An athlete wins more than one medal for tennis. Tennis is a sport with a high level of competition, and it's not uncommon for top athletes to win multiple medals in a single Olympics. However, the number of athletes who achieve this feat is relatively small. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, for example, only two athletes won multiple medals in tennis (Alexander Zverev and Belinda Bencic). Given the competitive nature of tennis and the relatively small number of athletes who win multiple medals, I estimate the probability of an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics to be around 0.3. Condition 2: Individual Neutral Athletes win 21 or more gold medals. The number of gold medals won by Individual Neutral Athletes (formerly known as Olympic Athletes from Russia) can vary greatly from one Olympics to another. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Russian athletes competing under the Olympic flag won a total of 20 gold medals. However, it's difficult to predict with certainty how many gold medals Individual Neutral Athletes will win in the 2024 Paris Olympics, as it depends on various factors such as team composition, athlete performance, and competition dynamics. Given the uncertainty and the fact that 21 or more gold medals is a relatively high threshold, I estimate the probability of Individual Neutral Athletes winning 21 or more gold medals to be around 0.2. Combining the probabilities: To estimate the probability of both conditions being met, we need to multiply the individual probabilities.

Event (a) involves at least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early. The context from Politico suggests that there is already a drafted letter circulating among House Democrats, and Rep. Jared Huffman has expressed strong opposition to the early nomination plan. Given the reported involvement of 'dozens of House Democrats' in the effort, it seems plausible that at least 20 Democrats might sign the letter. However, it's uncertain whether the letter will be made public and whether the required number of signatures will be reached before the market close on July 21st. Event (b) involves the Democrats having a brokered convention in 2024, which requires more than one round of voting in the roll call ballot to formally nominate their candidate. A brokered convention is often seen as a rare and unpredictable event, but the current political landscape and the controversy surrounding Biden's candidacy might increase its likelihood. Considering the potential correlation between the two events, it's possible that the same underlying factors driving opposition to Biden's early nomination could also contribute to a brokered convention. However, the events are not directly linked, and a brokered convention would require a more significant and prolonged level of opposition or uncertainty within the party. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as around 0.6-0.7, reflecting the plausible but uncertain nature of the event. For event (b), I estimate the probability as around 0.3-0.4, reflecting the relatively rare and unpredictable nature of a brokered convention. To estimate the probability of both events occurring, I will use a rough estimate of their potential correlation. Assuming a moderate positive correlation (e.g., 0.4-0.5) between the two events, we can use a simple probabilistic model to estimate the joint probability. For simplicity, let's assume the events are independent, which would give us a lower bound for the joint probability. Using the estimated probabilities for each event, we get: P(both events) \u2248 P(a) \u00d7 P(b) \u2248 0.65 \u00d7 0.35 \u2248 0.2275.

Event (a): Liz Cheney becomes the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Reasoning: Liz Cheney is a prominent Republican politician, but her chances of becoming the nominee are uncertain. She has been a vocal critic of former President Trump, which might affect her popularity among some Republican voters. However, she has also gained support from some moderate Republicans and independents. The Republican National Convention's delegates will ultimately decide the nominee, and it's difficult to predict their preferences.

Event (b): Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President. Reasoning: Joe Biden has not explicitly stated that he will not seek re-election, and it's common for incumbent presidents to seek re-election. While there have been some rumors and speculations about his potential retirement, there is no concrete evidence to suggest he will decline the nomination. In fact, Biden has hinted at running for re-election in the past. Given this, I'd estimate the probability of Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination as relatively low, around 0.2 (20%). Combined probability: To estimate the probability of both events occurring, we need to multiply the individual probabilities: 0.1 (Liz Cheney becomes the nominee) \u00d7 0.2 (Joe Biden declines the nomination) = 0.02. Reasoning: The combined probability is relatively low, as both events are uncertain and not highly likely to occur.

First, let's consider event (a). The Kalenjin people are an ethnic group from Kenya known for their dominance in long-distance running. They have produced many world-class athletes, including Olympic champions. However, winning both the men's and women's marathon races is a challenging task, even for a talented group like the Kalenjin. We need to consider the competition from other top athletes from around the world. According to the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the current world rankings for the men's and women's marathon events feature athletes from various countries, including Kenya, Ethiopia, and Japan. While Kalenjin athletes are well-represented in these rankings, it's difficult to predict with certainty that they will win both events. Event (b) involves Sifan Hassan, a Dutch middle- and long-distance runner of Ethiopian descent. She is a highly accomplished athlete with multiple Olympic and World Championship medals. However, the competition in the women's events at the 2024 Paris Olympics will be fierce, and it's uncertain whether Hassan will be able to win a medal. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as around 20-30%, considering the strength of the Kalenjin athletes but also the tough competition from other nations. For event (b), I estimate the probability of Sifan Hassan winning a medal as around 40-50%, given her past achievements but also the uncertainty of the competition. Since the question resolves YES if either event (a) or (b) occurs, we need to calculate the probability of the union of these two events. Assuming independence, the probability of the union is 1 minus the probability of neither event occurring. Let's use the lower end of the estimated ranges for both events: 0.2 for event (a) and 0.4 for event (b). The probability of neither event occurring is (1 - 0.2) * (1 - 0.4) = 0.48.

As of my last update, I do not have real-time information on the current status of the case, including any recent developments or announcements from the prosecution or the court. 2. Witness Tampering Allegations: Witness tampering is a serious offense that involves attempting to influence, alter, or prevent the testimony of a witness. For Trump to be charged with this, there would need to be evidence that he attempted to tamper with witnesses in the case. 3. Prosecutorial Discretion: The decision to charge someone with a crime lies with the prosecutor. This decision is based on the strength of the evidence, the likelihood of securing a conviction, and other legal and ethical considerations. 4. Political Climate: Given Trump's political profile, any legal action against him is likely to be highly scrutinized and politicized. However, the legal system is designed to operate independently of political pressures. 5. Timeframe: The question specifies that the charging must occur before June 1, 2024. This gives a specific timeframe for the event to occur. Given these considerations, without specific information on recent developments in the case or direct evidence of witness tampering by Trump, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

Political Climate: The political environment in the United States is highly polarized. The mention of a GOP lawmaker asking Merrick Garland to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Biden from office indicates a level of opposition from the Republican party. However, the invocation of the 25th Amendment requires a significant level of consensus, especially when it involves the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet, which are currently controlled by the Democratic party. 2. Procedural Difficulty: The 25th Amendment Section 4 is a rarely used provision that requires a high threshold of agreement among the Vice President and the Cabinet. It is designed for situations where the President is clearly unable to perform their duties, such as severe illness or incapacitation. The bar for invoking this section is intentionally set high to prevent its use as a political tool. 3. Precedent and Implications: There is no recent precedent for the successful invocation of the 25th Amendment Section 4 against a President's will. Such an action would be unprecedented in U.S. history and would have significant constitutional and political implications. It would likely be challenged legally and could lead to a constitutional crisis. 4. Timing: The question specifies a resolution before August 2024. Given the current political landscape and the procedural hurdles involved, it seems unlikely that such a significant and unprecedented action could be initiated and completed within this timeframe, especially considering the potential legal challenges and political fallout.

Season 2, however, shows a wider range of ratings, with a significant drop in episodes 5 and 6, but a notable peak in episode 4. 2.

Ireland, on the other hand, has had a more mixed record, with a qualification rate of around 40-50%. To estimate the probability of both countries qualifying, we can multiply their individual probabilities. However, this assumes independence, which might not be the case, as both countries' performances can be influenced by the same factors (e.g., the strength of the competition in their semi-final).

Secondly, we should consider the timeline for the Democratic primary elections and the factors that might influence Biden's decision. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in August 2024, and the primary elections will likely take place between February and June 2024.

While it's possible that he might change his mind, there is no strong indication that he will drop out of the race. In fact, his campaign has been actively fundraising and building momentum.

Secondly, regarding his resignation from the presidency, there is no credible evidence to suggest that Joe Biden is planning to resign.

However, considering the nature of the charges and the timeframe provided (before June 1, 2024), several factors can be taken into account: 1. Legal Proceedings Timeline: Legal proceedings, especially those involving potential witness tampering, can be lengthy. The investigation phase alone can take significant time, and if charges are to be filed, it would likely happen after a thorough investigation. Given the start date of the question (August 18, 2023) and the resolution date (June 1, 2024), there is a window of approximately nine months for the investigation to conclude and for charges to be potentially filed. 2. Complexity of Witness Tampering Charges: Witness tampering is a serious offense that requires substantial evidence to prosecute. The legal system moves cautiously in such cases to ensure that any charges brought have a strong foundation. This caution can slow down the process. 3. Political Considerations: Cases involving high-profile political figures like Donald Trump are often subject to intense scrutiny and political considerations. This can further complicate and potentially slow down the legal process. 4. Precedent and Legal History: While there have been instances of political figures being charged with various offenses, the specifics of each case are unique. The legal history of similar cases might offer some insight, but the outcome in this scenario is difficult to predict based solely on precedent.

Historically, the party has made significant strides in promoting gender equality and increasing female representation in politics. One notable trend is the growing number of female candidates running for public office, including the presidency. In the 2020 Democratic primary, several women ran for the nomination, including notable candidates like Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Tulsi Gabbard. Although none of them secured the nomination, their participation helped pave the way for future female candidates. Another factor to consider is the party's commitment to diversity and inclusion. The Democratic Party has made a concerted effort to promote women's rights, reproductive health, and equal pay, which could contribute to a more favorable environment for a female nominee. However, it's also important to acknowledge the challenges female candidates face in presidential elections, including biases, stereotypes, and unequal media coverage. These obstacles could impact a woman's ability to secure the nomination. Given these factors, I'll consider the following probabilities: Probability of a woman running for the Democratic nomination: 0.8 (highly likely, given recent trends); Probability of a woman winning the nomination, given that a woman runs: 0.4 (somewhat uncertain, considering the challenges female candidates face).

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort to its enemies, are disqualified from holding federal office.

Given the complexity of the process and the limited time frame before the July 15, 2024, deadline, it is unlikely that Trump will be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

Event (a): Joe Biden has an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024. Reasoning: As the President of the United States, Joe Biden is a public figure who frequently engages with the media. He has already participated in several interviews and public appearances since taking office. Given his busy schedule, it is likely that he will have at least one in-person interview or conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024. This could be a planned interview with a major news network, a podcast, or a late-night show. The timeframe of approximately 9 months provides ample opportunity for such an event to occur. Probability: 0.8 Event (b): Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024. Reasoning: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States are ineligible to hold public office. While there have been discussions and lawsuits regarding Donald Trump's eligibility due to his role in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack, it is uncertain whether any state will officially remove or block him from the primary election ballot under this clause by July 15, 2024. The legal process can be slow, and the outcome is difficult to predict. However, given the ongoing investigations and lawsuits, there is a possibility that a state might take action against Trump's candidacy.

For event (a), it's difficult to predict with certainty, but we can consider the following factors: Joe Biden's age and health, his current schedule and commitments, and the typical media engagement of a sitting U.S. President. Given his age and health, it's possible that Biden may not be as active in giving long interviews. However, as the sitting President, he still engages with the media regularly. While there's no guarantee, it's plausible that he might have an in-person interview or conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024. For event (b), the removal of Donald Trump from a primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is a more complex and contentious issue.

Firstly, Croatia has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest consistently since its debut in 1993, with the exception of a few years. This suggests that they are likely to participate in the contest again in 2024. Secondly, the qualification process for the Grand Final involves a semi-final round where countries compete to secure a spot in the final. The top 10 countries from each semi-final, as determined by a combination of jury and public voting, qualify for the Grand Final. While it's difficult to predict the performance of Croatia's entry, the country has had a mixed record in the contest, with some successful years and some less successful ones. However, given the large number of participating countries and the unpredictable nature of the contest, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction.

Malta, on the other hand, has generally been a consistent qualifier, often finishing in the top 10 in the Grand Final. However, it's difficult to make predictions based solely on past performance, as the contest is highly unpredictable and can be influenced by many factors, such as the quality of the songs, the performance on the night, and the voting patterns of the different countries.
