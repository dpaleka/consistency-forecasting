However, the men's 100m dash is an event where athletes are constantly pushing the boundaries of human speed, and it's possible that an athlete could break the record at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. One factor to consider is the recent trend of athletic performance in the men's 100m dash. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the winning time was 9.80s, which is still slower than the Olympic record. However, there have been several athletes who have run sub-9.80s times in recent years, including Trayvon Bromell, who ran a 9.76s in 2021, and Erriyon Knighton, who ran a 9.89s in 2022. Another factor to consider is the quality of the field at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. The Olympics tend to attract the best athletes from around the world, and it's likely that several athletes will be competing in the men's 100m dash who have the potential to break the Olympic record.

Historical context: Iran and Israel have a longstanding adversarial relationship, with periods of heightened tensions and proxy conflicts in the region. However, direct attacks by Iran within Israel's borders have been relatively rare. 2. Current tensions: As of the question's creation date (April 10, 2024), there are no publicly known significant escalations or incidents that would suggest an imminent attack by Iran. 3. Geopolitical considerations: Iran is currently facing various domestic and international challenges, including economic sanctions, protests, and regional conflicts. While these factors might contribute to a desire to distract from internal issues or project power, they also limit Iran's ability to engage in costly and risky military actions. 4. Israeli defense capabilities: Israel has a robust military and defense system, which would make it difficult for Iran to carry out a successful attack, especially one that results in a significant number of casualties. 5. Timeframe: The question's timeframe is relatively short, spanning approximately 20 days. This limited window reduces the likelihood of an attack, as it would require Iran to plan and execute an operation quickly.

Historically, Iran and Israel have been involved in a long-standing conflict, with periods of heightened tensions and occasional clashes. However, the likelihood of a direct attack by Iran on Israel, resulting in at least three deaths, is difficult to assess with certainty. One factor to consider is the current state of Iran's military capabilities and its willingness to engage in aggressive actions. Iran has been involved in various regional conflicts, including in Syria and Yemen, and has demonstrated its ability to launch attacks on foreign soil. However, a direct attack on Israel would be a significant escalation and would likely carry significant risks for Iran. Another factor to consider is the potential consequences of such an attack for Iran. A deadly attack on Israel would likely lead to a strong response from Israel and potentially other countries, including the United States.

This historical context suggests that the potential for conflict is high. However, it's also important to consider the current situation. While there have been recent tensions and incidents, such as the drone attack on an Iranian military facility in Isfahan in January 2023 and the reported Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria, these events have not escalated into a full-blown conflict. Furthermore, both countries have shown restraint in the past when it comes to direct attacks on each other's soil. Iran has primarily focused on supporting proxy groups in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, rather than launching direct attacks on Israel. Israel, on the other hand, has been cautious in its responses to Iranian aggression, often opting for targeted strikes rather than large-scale attacks.

Assuming an average daily probability of 6% (midpoint of the 5-8% range), the probability of at least one day with Kp > 4 during the 11-day period from July 17 to July 28, 2024, can be estimated using the binomial distribution.

Although I don't have access to real-time data, I can rely on general knowledge about geomagnetic storms and their causes. Geomagnetic storms are caused by changes in the Earth's magnetic field, often triggered by solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun. The Kp index is a measure of the disturbance level of the Earth's magnetic field, with higher values indicating stronger storms. Historically, geomagnetic storms with Kp > 4 are not uncommon, especially during periods of high solar activity. However, the probability of such an event occurring within a specific 11-day period is difficult to estimate without real-time data on solar activity and space weather forecasts. Given the lack of specific information about current solar activity and space weather forecasts, I will rely on general historical probabilities. According to the German Research Center for Geosciences, the Kp index is greater than 4 for approximately 10-20% of the time. However, this probability can vary greatly depending on the solar cycle and current space weather conditions. Assuming an average probability and considering that the question is asking about the strongest geomagnetic storm within an 11-day period, I will adjust the probability slightly upward to account for the possibility of multiple storms occurring during this time frame."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09889016196089304, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04944508098044652, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.45433689961153706, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historically, the Philippines and China have had complex relations, particularly concerning territorial disputes in the South China Sea. However, diplomatic expulsions or recalls are significant actions that typically follow major incidents or as a result of prolonged tensions. Given the current global and regional political climate, there are several factors to consider: 1. Territorial Disputes: The South China Sea disputes have been a long-standing issue between the Philippines and China. While these tensions could escalate, recent years have seen a mix of diplomatic efforts and military posturing without leading to expulsions or recalls. 2. Global Diplomatic Trends: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of diplomatic relations and cooperation. Many countries, including those with tense relations, have sought to maintain or improve diplomatic ties during this period. 3. Recent Relations: Without specific recent incidents or heightened tensions publicly reported that would necessitate such drastic diplomatic measures, the likelihood of expulsions or recalls based solely on historical context seems low. 4. Predictive Factors: Without access to real-time data or specific incidents that have occurred after the question's creation date (May 18, 2024), it's challenging to adjust the probability based on very recent events.

Historically, geomagnetic storms with Kp values greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 are relatively moderate in intensity.

Historically, geomagnetic storms with Kp indices greater than 4 are not uncommon, especially during periods of high solar activity. However, the probability of such an event occurring during a specific 11-day period is difficult to predict with certainty. To make an informed estimate, we can look at the frequency of geomagnetic storms with Kp indices greater than 4 over the past few years. According to data from the German Research Center for Geosciences, there are on average around 10-20 days per year with Kp indices greater than 4. Given that the question is asking about a specific 11-day period, we can assume that the probability of a geomagnetic storm with a Kp index greater than 4 occurring during this time is roughly proportional to the average annual frequency of such events. Assuming an average of 15 days per year with Kp indices greater than 4, and considering that the question is asking about an 11-day period, we can estimate the probability as follows: Probability = (Number of days with Kp > 4 in the given period) / (Total number of days in the given period). Using historical data, we can estimate that there is approximately a 20-30% chance of a geomagnetic storm with a Kp index greater than 4 occurring on any given day. Therefore, for an 11-day period, the probability of at least one day with a Kp index greater than 4 is: Probability = 1 - (Probability of no days with Kp > 4)^11. Using the estimated daily probability of 25%, we get: Probability \u2248 1 - (0.75)^11 \u2248 0.67. So, the probability of the strongest geomagnetic storm having a Kp index greater than 4 between July 17 and July 28, 2024, is approximately 67%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

In 2020, Russian athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee's flag due to a doping ban imposed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The IOC has been under pressure to take a stronger stance against Russia's doping program, and there have been calls to ban Russian athletes from competing altogether. However, the IOC has also shown a willingness to allow Russian athletes to compete under certain conditions, such as competing under a neutral flag or with certain restrictions.

The combination of these two characters in a single film is likely to attract a large audience, given their individual successes. 2. Previous Box Office Performances: 'Deadpool' (2016) opened with $132,434,639, and 'The Wolverine' (2013) opened with $53,113,752. The combined opening figure is $185,548,391. Given the growth in the franchise's popularity and the trend of increasing box office revenues for successful sequels and spin-offs, it's plausible that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could surpass this combined figure. 3. Marketing and Anticipation: The marketing strategy for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' and the anticipation among fans could significantly impact its opening weekend. A well-executed marketing campaign highlighting the unique blend of these characters could generate substantial interest. 4.

To answer this, we need to consider the factors that might influence the box office performance of the new movie. Firstly, 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is a highly anticipated movie that brings together two popular Marvel characters, Deadpool and Wolverine. The previous Deadpool movies have performed exceptionally well at the box office, with 'Deadpool' (2016) opening at $132.4 million and 'Deadpool 2' (2018) opening at $125.5 million. Wolverine has also had successful movies, with 'Logan' (2017) opening at $88.4 million. The combination of these two characters is likely to attract a large audience and generate significant box office revenue. Secondly, the movie is scheduled to be released in 2024, which is a good time for a blockbuster release. The summer season is typically a peak time for movie releases, and the movie is likely to benefit from the usual summer blockbuster hype. Lastly, the production budget for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is likely to be high, given the involvement of two major characters and the need for significant special effects. This could impact the movie's profitability, but it is unlikely to affect its opening weekend box office performance.

OpenAI's Current Stance and Culture: OpenAI has already demonstrated a commitment to transparency and open communication, as evidenced by their willingness to engage with the public and researchers about AI safety and risks. This existing culture suggests a foundation upon which a more formal commitment could be built. 2. The Principle's Alignment with OpenAI's Goals: The principle of 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' aligns with OpenAI's broader goals of advancing AI in a safe and beneficial manner. Embracing this principle could enhance their reputation and contribute to a safer AI development environment, which is in their long-term interest. 3. External Pressure and Community Expectations: The existence of initiatives like righttowarn.ai and the specific call for OpenAI to commit to this principle indicates a level of external pressure and community expectation. OpenAI, being a leader in the AI field, might feel compelled to respond to these expectations to maintain its positive public image and relationship with the AI research community. 4. Timeframe and Practical Considerations: The timeframe given (before July 1, 2024) is relatively short, which might pose a challenge for OpenAI to formally adopt and announce such a principle, especially if it involves significant internal policy changes or approvals. However, the principle itself is straightforward, and a public statement of commitment could be made relatively quickly if there is the will to do so. 5. Verification by Metaculus and Acceptance by righttowarn.ai: The requirement for Metaculus to verify OpenAI's commitment and for it to be satisfactory to at least one member of righttowarn.ai adds an additional layer of complexity. This step ensures that any commitment made by OpenAI is taken seriously and is not just a superficial gesture. However, it also means that OpenAI must not only make a commitment but also ensure it meets external standards, which could be a hurdle. Considering these factors, while there are valid reasons to believe OpenAI might commit to the principle (alignment with their goals, external pressure, existing culture of openness), the requirement for a new level of commitment, the need for verification, and the short timeframe introduce uncertainty.

To estimate this probability, let's consider the following factors: 1. Director: Lee Isaac Chung is known for directing 'Minari,' which received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. This suggests that Chung has a track record of creating well-received films. 2. Cast: The film stars Glen Powell, who has appeared in successful films like 'Top Gun: Maverick,' and Daisy Edgar Jones, who has received praise for her performances in 'Normal People' and other projects. The presence of talented actors can contribute to a film's overall quality and critical reception. 3. Genre: 'Twisters' is a disaster film, which can be a challenging genre to execute well. However, the original 'Twister' (1996) received a 63% Tomatometer score, indicating that the concept has some potential for critical success. 4. Market trends: The market for disaster films has evolved since the original 'Twister' was released. Modern audiences may have different expectations and preferences, which could impact the film's critical reception. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of 'Twisters' (2024) having a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of at least 70% as follows: Probability: 0.55. This probability reflects my uncertainty about the film's critical reception, given the mixed factors mentioned above. While the director and cast have a track record of success, the genre and market trends introduce some uncertainty.

However, predicting the timing and nature of such incidents is inherently challenging due to the numerous variables at play, including diplomatic efforts, internal political considerations within both countries, and the influence of external actors. Despite these uncertainties, several factors suggest a heightened risk. Iran's military capabilities, including its missile and drone technologies, pose a significant threat to Israel. Moreover, Iran's support for various militant groups in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, adds to the potential for conflict. Israel has been proactive in its military strategy, often conducting strikes against Iranian assets in Syria and other parts of the region, which could provoke a response from Iran. However, it's also important to consider that both countries have managed to avoid direct large-scale conflict for years, despite numerous close calls and proxy wars. The international community, including major powers and regional actors, has a significant interest in preventing such an escalation, which could have far-reaching consequences for the global economy and stability in the Middle East.

To start, I'll consider the current geopolitical climate in the region. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a longstanding and complex issue, with periods of heightened tensions and violence. However, it's essential to note that the frequency and severity of attacks have decreased significantly since the Second Intifada (2000-2005). Recent years have seen a relative calm, with occasional outbreaks of violence, mostly in the form of rocket attacks from Gaza or stabbing attacks by individuals. However, these incidents have been relatively contained, and the number of casualties has been limited. That being said, there are several factors that could contribute to an increased risk of a deadly attack within Israel: 1. Escalating tensions: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is always simmering, and tensions can escalate quickly due to various factors, such as settlement expansion, Palestinian prisoner releases, or significant anniversaries. 2. Gaza Strip: The Gaza Strip, controlled by Hamas, has been a hotbed of militant activity. Although the frequency of rocket attacks has decreased, the risk of an escalation remains. 3. Iran's influence: Iran's support for militant groups in the region, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, could contribute to an increased risk of attacks. 4. Lone-wolf attacks: Individual attackers, often motivated by extremist ideologies, can still pose a significant threat. Despite these factors, I'll consider the following mitigating circumstances: 1. Israeli security measures: Israel has a robust security apparatus, including the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), the Shin Bet (internal security agency), and the police. These organizations have a strong track record of preventing and responding to attacks. 2. International pressure: The international community, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations, has consistently called for calm and restraint in the region. 3. Economic factors: The Palestinian economy is heavily dependent on Israel, and a significant escalation could have severe economic consequences for the Palestinian Authority. Considering these factors, I'll estimate the probability of a deadly attack within Israel before May 1, 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Timeframe for Coverage: The question specifies that the coverage must occur at least 6 hours in advance of the official announcement. This timeframe is reasonable for major news outlets to verify information through their sources and prepare a report. 4. Exclusions: The question explicitly excludes local news, conspiracy websites, and individual comments on platforms like Manifold, focusing only on well-established, reliable media outlets. This narrows down the scope to outlets with a proven track record of journalistic integrity and the capability to verify information before publishing. Considering these factors, it seems likely that if Joe Biden were to drop out, a reliable media outlet would cover the story with at least an unofficial confirmation at least 6 hours in advance. The competitive nature of political reporting, combined with the significance of such an event, would motivate major outlets to break the story as soon as possible after verifying the information."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

To assess this probability, let's consider a few factors: 1. Media Competition and Sensitivity: In today's fast-paced news environment, media outlets are highly competitive and often strive to break news stories first. If there is credible information or a strong rumor about Biden dropping out, it's likely that at least one outlet will attempt to verify and report on it ahead of time to gain an edge over others. 2. Sources and Leaks: Political campaigns, especially at the presidential level, involve numerous staff members, advisors, and associates who might leak information to the press. Given the significant implications of a dropout, there's a high likelihood that rumors or unofficial confirmations could reach media outlets. 3. Verification Process: Reputable media outlets have a verification process to ensure the accuracy of sensitive information. However, the pressure to be the first to report a major story can sometimes lead to a quicker turnaround in reporting, especially if multiple sources confirm the information. 4. The Nature of Political News: Political news, especially concerning major figures like the President, spreads rapidly. The dropout of a major candidate is a monumental story that would attract immediate attention from all major news outlets. 5.

Firstly, OpenAI has been actively working on improving the safety and security of their AI models. They have been engaging with external researchers and experts in the field to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities. This suggests that they are taking proactive steps to address safety concerns, which could include publishing reports on external red-teaming efforts. Secondly, OpenAI has a history of transparency and openness in their research and development process. They have published numerous research papers and reports on their models, including safety-related research. This openness suggests that they may be willing to share the results of external red-teaming efforts with the public. Thirdly, the AI safety community has been growing rapidly in recent years, and there is increasing pressure on AI developers to prioritize safety and transparency. Publishing a report on external red-teaming efforts could be seen as a way for OpenAI to demonstrate their commitment to safety and build trust with the public and the research community. However, there are also potential reasons why OpenAI may not publish such a report. For example, they may not have conducted external red-teaming efforts, or they may not feel that the results are significant enough to warrant a public report. Additionally, they may be concerned about the potential risks of sharing sensitive information about their models' vulnerabilities. Overall, considering OpenAI's history of transparency, their proactive approach to safety, and the growing pressure on AI developers to prioritize safety, I believe that it is likely that they will publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by December 31, 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.013484452357764853, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.006742226178882427, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1641772758257798, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Polling variability: Polling averages can be influenced by individual polls with varying sample sizes, methodologies, and margins of error.

To estimate this probability, I will consider the current geopolitical tensions and diplomatic relations between the two countries. The Philippines and China have had a complex relationship in recent years, with disputes over territorial claims in the South China Sea and concerns over Chinese military activities in the region. However, despite these tensions, both countries have maintained diplomatic relations and have engaged in various forms of cooperation, such as trade and economic agreements. Given the current state of relations, I believe that diplomatic expulsions or recalls are possible but not highly likely. The Philippines and China have a history of resolving disputes through diplomatic channels, and it is likely that they will continue to do so.

To assess this, we need to consider the current state of relations between the two countries and any potential flashpoints that could lead to such an event. The Philippines and China have had a complex relationship in recent years, with tensions rising over issues such as territorial disputes in the South China Sea and China's growing military presence in the region. However, despite these tensions, both countries have maintained diplomatic relations and have engaged in various forms of cooperation, including trade and economic exchanges. In recent years, there have been no major incidents or events that would suggest a significant escalation of tensions between the two countries. While there have been some minor incidents, such as the arrest of Chinese fishermen in Philippine waters, these have been resolved through diplomatic channels without leading to any expulsions or recalls. Given the current state of relations and the lack of any major flashpoints, it seems unlikely that diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before August 1, 2025.

Historically, the Olympics have seen a significant number of countries winning their first-ever gold medals. For instance, at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 8 countries won their first-ever gold medals. However, the number of countries winning their debut gold medals can vary greatly from one Olympics to another, depending on various factors such as the sports and events included, the level of competition, and the performance of the participating countries. Given the large number of countries participating in the Olympics (over 200) and the diverse range of sports and events (over 300), it is likely that some countries will win their debut gold medals. However, the exact number is difficult to predict. To make an educated estimate, let's consider the following: The number of countries winning their debut gold medals has been increasing over the years, thanks to the inclusion of new sports and events. The 2024 Olympics will feature several new sports and events, which could provide opportunities for countries to win their debut gold medals. However, the level of competition in the Olympics is extremely high, and it's challenging for countries to win gold medals, especially in popular sports like track and field, swimming, and gymnastics.

Secondly, the 2024 Paris Olympics will likely feature a strong field of competitors, including Duplantis and other top-ranked pole vaulters. The presence of such talented athletes increases the likelihood of a record-breaking performance. Lastly, the Olympic Games often bring out the best in athletes, with the pressure and prestige of the event motivating them to deliver exceptional performances. This could lead to a record-breaking attempt, especially if the competition is fierce and the athletes are closely matched. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the Olympic record for the men's pole vault being broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics as follows:"}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "f237b284-7ee0-481e-8816-b25b45fc00be", "title": "Will any Olympic record be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if at the 2024 Paris Olympics, any Olympic record in any event is broken, according to results posted by the [International Olympic Committee](https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/olympic-results) or credible sources.

Firstly, it's important to note that the 25th Amendment is a constitutional provision that allows for the transfer of power to the Vice President if the President is unable to discharge their duties. However, this provision is typically invoked in cases of serious illness, injury, or incapacitation, and not for political reasons.

However, given the current pace of developments in the tech industry, it's conceivable that OpenAI could make such a commitment within this period, especially if it's already under consideration or in response to immediate public or stakeholder pressure. 5. Verification by Metaculus and righttowarn.ai: The question specifies that the commitment must be verified by Metaculus and accepted by at least one member of righttowarn.ai.

However, there are a few factors that could potentially disrupt this pattern. Firstly, the US government has been exploring ways to increase competition in the domain name market, which might lead to changes in the agreement or even its termination. Secondly, there have been concerns raised about Verisign's management of the .com TLD, including issues related to pricing and security. Despite these factors, it's essential to note that the US government has a history of maintaining stability in the domain name system, and sudden changes are unlikely.

The resolution of this question depends on the assessment of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map, which provides updates on the conflict in Ukraine. To answer this question, I need to consider the current situation in Ukraine, the trends in the conflict, and the likelihood of changes in control over the next few months. As of the current date (April 25, 2024), the conflict in Ukraine is ongoing, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces engaged in various parts of the country. While it is difficult to predict the outcome of the conflict, I can consider some general trends and factors that might influence the control of Chasiv Yar. Firstly, Chasiv Yar is located in the Donetsk Oblast, which has been a contested region throughout the conflict. The city has been under Ukrainian control for most of the war, but there have been periods of intense fighting and changes in control. Secondly, the ISW map provides a snapshot of the situation on the ground, but it may not always reflect the most up-to-date information. The map is updated regularly, but there may be delays or discrepancies in the reporting. Given these factors, I will consider the following scenarios: 1. Russian forces maintain or gain control of Chasiv Yar: This scenario is possible, given the ongoing conflict and the presence of Russian forces in the region. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether they will be able to maintain or gain control of the city. 2. Ukrainian forces maintain or regain control of Chasiv Yar: This scenario is also possible, given the Ukrainian military's efforts to defend their territory and the support they receive from international partners. Considering these scenarios, I estimate the probability of Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, as follows: Probability: 0.4. This probability reflects my uncertainty about the outcome, given the ongoing conflict and the factors mentioned above. While it is possible that Russian forces may maintain or gain control of Chasiv Yar, it is also possible that Ukrainian forces may maintain or regain control. The probability of 0.4 indicates that I consider the outcome to be uncertain, with a slight leaning towards Ukrainian control."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "b29abd70-e0bc-48cf-8398-88a6dc670e5e", "title": "Will Russia have control of any part of Ukraine on June 1, 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, when accessed by Metaculus on June 1, 2024, the [Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375) shows any part of Ukraine under any of the following categories:\n\n- Assessed Russian Advance in Ukraine\n\n- Assessed Russian Gains in the Past 24 Hours\n\n- Assessed Russian Control\n\n- Claimed Russian Territory in Ukraine\n\n- Any other categories created by ISW that indicate Russian control of any part of Ukraine\n\nThe question will resolve as **No** if no part of Ukraine is assessed to be in any of the categories indicating Russian control, which includes but is not limited to:\n\n- Reported Ukrainian Territorial Gains in the Past 24 Hours\n\n- Claimed Ukrainian Counteroffensives\n\n- Reported Ukrainian Partisan Warfare\n\n- Any other categories created by ISW that indicate Ukrainian control of the location or a lack of Russian control of the location", "resolution_date": "2024-06-01T19:00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "created_date": "2024-04-25T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.7, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability of Russia having control of any part of Ukraine on June 1, 2024, we need to consider the current situation and the dynamics of the conflict.

Current political landscape: The 2024 presidential election is expected to be highly contested, with multiple candidates likely to participate in the primaries. This increases the likelihood of debates being organized to help voters make informed decisions. 3. Organizational efforts: Various organizations, such as the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), have traditionally played a significant role in organizing debates. The CPD has already announced plans for the 2024 general election debates, which suggests that the infrastructure for hosting debates is in place. 4.

Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017), the sequel to The Wolverine (2013), both received critical acclaim and performed well at the box office. This growth in popularity could contribute to a higher opening for a combined film. 2.

This combined star power could lead to a higher box office draw. 3. Current Market Trends: The box office performance of recent superhero movies has been strong, with many films in the genre achieving high opening weekends. If this trend continues, it could favor a higher opening for 'Deadpool & Wolverine'. 4. Competition and Release Date: The success of the movie's opening weekend can also depend on its release date and the competition it faces. A strategic release date that avoids direct competition with other major blockbusters could help. 5. Marketing and Reception: The marketing strategy and early reviews of the movie will also play a crucial role in determining its opening weekend success. Positive buzz and effective marketing could boost its chances of a high opening. Given these considerations, while there are factors that could contribute to a higher opening, predicting box office performance is inherently uncertain.

Deadpool and Wolverine are both popular characters in the Marvel universe, and their previous movies have performed well at the box office. The success of the previous Deadpool movies, particularly the first one, which opened with $132,434,639, suggests that there is a strong fan base for the character. Second, we need to consider the marketing and promotion of the new movie. If the movie is well-marketed and promoted, it could attract a large audience and perform well at the box office. The fact that the movie is a team-up between two popular characters could also generate buzz and attract fans who are interested in seeing the two characters together on screen. Third, we need to consider the competition at the box office. If there are other big movies opening around the same time, it could impact the performance of 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.

Secondly, the recent escalation of violence in the region, including drone attacks and naval confrontations, suggests a heightened state of hostility. This environment could potentially lead to more aggressive actions by Israel to counter perceived threats from Iran. Thirdly, the specific requirement for the attack to result in at least five fatalities and be attributed to Israel within Iran's borders narrows the scope but still allows for various scenarios, including airstrikes, sabotage, or special operations. Given these considerations, while there's no concrete evidence to predict such an event with certainty, the historical and current tensions between Israel and Iran, along with the ongoing shadow war, suggest that the possibility of a deadly attack cannot be ruled out."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, the original 'Deadpool' (2016) was a massive success, grossing over $782 million worldwide, with a significant portion of that coming from the domestic box office. The success of the first film can be attributed to its unique blend of humor, action, and irreverence, which resonated with audiences.

Secondly, the combined opening weekend of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' is $185,548,391. This is a significant amount, but it's not an unusually high number for a big-budget superhero movie. Considering the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the increasing popularity of superhero movies, it's possible that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could exceed this number.

If Disney perceives a need to stay competitive, especially in terms of nighttime entertainment, this could drive the decision to announce a new parade. 5.

D23 as a Platform for Announcements: D23 Expo is a significant event for Disney, where it traditionally makes major announcements about upcoming projects, including new attractions, shows, and parades. Given the nature of the event, it's a prime opportunity for Disney to reveal new experiences. Current Lineup and Demand: The Magic Kingdom's current nighttime entertainment lineup might be due for an update or expansion. The popularity of nighttime parades and the competitive landscape of theme park entertainment suggest that Disney might be looking to enhance its offerings.

However, this was an exceptional case, as the ROC had a large and strong team. In general, individual neutral athletes are not typically as competitive as athletes representing their countries, as they often lack the same level of support and resources. Additionally, the IOC has strict rules regarding the eligibility of individual neutral athletes, which can limit their participation. Given these factors, I believe it is unlikely that individual neutral athletes will win 20 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics. However, it's not impossible, as there may be exceptional cases where individual neutral athletes excel in their respective sports."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.08353693220682654, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04176846610341327, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4118331129111585, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Google DeepMind's Transparency and Research Culture: Google DeepMind is known for its commitment to transparency and open research. They frequently publish research papers and reports on various aspects of their AI models, including safety assessments. This culture of openness suggests they might be inclined to publish the results of external red-teaming. 2. Importance of AI Safety: The safety of AI models, especially those developed by prominent organizations like Google DeepMind, is a topic of growing concern and interest within the tech community and beyond. Publishing results from external red-teaming could be seen as a proactive step in addressing these concerns and demonstrating a commitment to safety. 3. External Red-Teaming as a Best Practice: Engaging in external red-teaming is considered a best practice in the development of secure and safe AI systems. It allows for an independent assessment of potential vulnerabilities and can significantly enhance the robustness and reliability of the models. Given this, it's plausible that Google DeepMind would not only conduct such tests but also be willing to share the results publicly. 4. Timeframe and Deadline: The question specifies a report being published by December 31, 2024. This gives Google DeepMind approximately 1.5 years from the question's creation date. Given the complexity of organizing external red-teaming and the subsequent analysis and reporting, this timeframe seems feasible, although it does impose a specific deadline. 5. Potential for Regulatory or Public Pressure: There's an increasing call for tech companies, especially those involved in AI development, to be more transparent about their safety protocols and testing. This could motivate Google DeepMind to publish such a report to preempt regulatory requirements or public scrutiny. Considering these factors, while there's no guarantee, the combination of Google DeepMind's culture, the importance of demonstrating AI safety, the recognition of external red-teaming as a best practice, the feasibility of the timeframe, and potential external pressures all support the likelihood of them publishing such a report."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The success of the previous Deadpool movies, including 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'Deadpool 2' (2018), has shown that audiences are eager to see more of these characters on the big screen. Secondly, the marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' has been significant, with a lot of hype and excitement generated around the movie. The trailers and promotional materials have been well-received by fans and critics alike, suggesting that the movie has a good chance of performing well at the box office. Thirdly, the current box office trends suggest that superhero movies, particularly those from the Marvel universe, tend to perform well. The success of recent movies like 'Avengers: Endgame' and 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' has shown that audiences are still eager to see big-budget superhero movies on the big screen.

As of July 5, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points, which suggests that Trump currently has a slight advantage. However, it's essential to note that polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, campaign events, and external factors like economic conditions or global events. Given the volatility of polling averages, it's challenging to predict with certainty how the polling average will change between July 5 and July 15, 2024. However, we can make an educated estimate based on historical trends and the current political landscape. In general, polling averages tend to be relatively stable over short periods, but they can also be influenced by significant events or shifts in public opinion. Assuming no major events or changes in voter sentiment occur between July 5 and July 15, 2024, it's reasonable to expect that Trump's lead will remain relatively stable.

In the 2020 Olympics, the top 5 countries in terms of the number of gold medals won in women's team sports were the United States (4), China (2), Germany (1), Great Britain (1), and Australia (1). This suggests that a few dominant countries tend to perform well across multiple team sports. However, it's also important to note that each sport has its own unique characteristics, and different countries may have strengths in different sports. For example, the United States is traditionally strong in basketball, while China is strong in volleyball. Given the number of sports involved and the diversity of countries participating, it's possible that different countries may win gold in different sports.

To answer this question, we need to consider the typical patterns of these respiratory viruses and their hospitalization rates. In general, COVID, influenza, and RSV tend to have overlapping seasons, with peaks often occurring between December and February. However, the exact timing and magnitude of these peaks can vary from year to year, depending on factors such as vaccination rates, population immunity, and viral mutations. Given the complexity of these factors and the inherent uncertainty in predicting the behavior of infectious diseases, it is challenging to make a precise prediction about the timing of the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations for COVID. However, we can make an educated estimate based on historical trends and the typical patterns of these viruses. Historically, COVID has tended to peak in late winter to early spring, while influenza and RSV often peak in late fall to early winter. Assuming that these patterns hold true for the 2023-24 season, it is possible that the combined peak for all three viruses could occur in late December or early January. If this is the case, then the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations for COVID would likely occur within four weeks of this combined peak, given the typical duration of the COVID peak. However, this is highly speculative, and there are many factors that could influence the actual timing of these events. This probability estimate reflects the uncertainty and complexity of predicting the behavior of infectious diseases. While there are historical trends and patterns that can inform our estimate, there are also many factors that could influence the actual outcome.

However, without access to real-time data or specific market analysis tools, I'll rely on general knowledge and principles of forecasting. 1. Historical Context: The BSE SENSEX has shown significant volatility over the years, influenced by global economic conditions, political stability, and domestic economic indicators. Its value can fluctuate widely based on these factors. 2. Forecasting Challenges: Predicting stock market indices with precision, especially for a specific date in the future, is inherently challenging due to the numerous variables at play. These include unforeseen global events, policy changes, and shifts in investor sentiment. 3. Range Prediction: The question asks for a range (greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000), which is somewhat broader than a point prediction. This range prediction is slightly more feasible than predicting an exact value but still involves considerable uncertainty. 4. Current Trends and Conditions: Without current data, it's difficult to assess the immediate trends leading up to July 2024. However, typically, if the global economy is stable, and there are no major geopolitical tensions or domestic economic downturns, the BSE SENSEX might be expected to grow or remain stable. Given these considerations, and without the ability to analyze current market trends or access to predictive models, I must rely on a broad, general assessment. The BSE SENSEX has fluctuated significantly over the years, and predicting its exact range for a specific future date is highly speculative.
