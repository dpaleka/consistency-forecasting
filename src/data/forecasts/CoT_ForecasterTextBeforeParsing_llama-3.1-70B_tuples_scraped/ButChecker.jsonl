Firstly, let's examine condition (a): The USA wins more Gold than Silver medals. In recent Olympics, the USA has consistently won a large number of medals, but the ratio of Gold to Silver medals has varied. For example, at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the USA won 39 Gold medals and 41 Silver medals. However, at the 2016 Rio Olympics, the USA won 46 Gold medals and 37 Silver medals. Given the variability in medal counts and the fact that the USA often wins a large number of medals, it's plausible that they could win more Gold than Silver medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics. Secondly, let's consider condition (b): The USA tops the Olympic Medal Table. The USA has historically been one of the top-performing countries at the Olympics, but the competition is intense, and other countries like China, Russia, and Great Britain often challenge for the top spot. However, the USA has a strong track record of producing talented athletes across a wide range of sports, which gives them a good chance of topping the medal table. Given these factors, it's difficult to estimate a precise probability, but we can make an educated guess. Let's assume that the probability of the USA winning more Gold than Silver medals (condition a) is around 0.4, based on their historical performance and the variability in medal counts. The probability of the USA topping the Olympic Medal Table (condition b) is likely lower, around 0.3, given the intense competition from other countries. Since the question resolves YES if either condition is met, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Assuming that the two conditions are not highly correlated, we can estimate P(A \u2229 B) as the product of the individual probabilities, 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12.

Firstly, the Eurovision Song Contest has become increasingly competitive in recent years, with more countries participating and the level of talent and production values rising. This makes it harder for any country to guarantee qualification. Secondly, Ireland's recent qualification record suggests that they are not a guaranteed qualifier, and their success is often dependent on the quality of their entry and the competition they face in their semi-final. However, it's also worth noting that Ireland has a dedicated fan base and a strong musical heritage, which can sometimes give them an edge in terms of public voting.

As of the question's creation date (April 25, 2024), the war in Ukraine is ongoing, and the situation is dynamic. However, I can look at the general trends and the current control of the area. Chasiv Yar is a city in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine, which has been a contested region throughout the conflict. As of April 2024, the city is reportedly under Ukrainian control, but the surrounding areas have seen ongoing fighting. Given the current situation, it is difficult to predict with certainty what the situation will be like on June 1, 2024. However, I can make an educated estimate based on the trends. The ISW map is a reliable source of information on the conflict, and it has been regularly updated to reflect the changing situation on the ground. If the map shows Chasiv Yar as being under Russian control on June 1, 2024, it would likely indicate a significant shift in the balance of power in the region. However, as of now, there is no clear indication that Russia will gain control of Chasiv Yar in the near future.

As of my knowledge cutoff, there is no indication that Biden plans to drop out of the race. In fact, he has shown strong commitment to running for re-election.

To combine these probabilities, we need to consider that these events are not mutually exclusive, but they are also not directly related. A reasonable approach is to use the 'union bound,' which states that the probability of at least one of the events occurring is less than or equal to the sum of their individual probabilities. Assuming independence, we can add the probabilities of the two events. Let's assign a probability of 0.05 (5%) to event (a) and 0.02 (2%) to event (b) based on the reasoning above. The combined probability would be: 0.05 + 0.02 = 0.07.

Event (a) - Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024: There is an ongoing investigation in Georgia related to potential election interference by Donald Trump. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of this investigation, there are a few factors to consider: 1. The investigation is ongoing, and there have been reports of potential witness intimidation or tampering. 2. The district attorney in charge of the investigation, Fani Willis, has shown a willingness to pursue charges against high-profile individuals. 3. The investigation is focused on Trump's actions in Georgia, which might be seen as a more favorable jurisdiction for prosecution compared to other states. However, it's essential to note that: 1. The investigation is ongoing, and it's unclear when or if charges will be filed. 2. Trump's legal team will likely vigorously defend against any charges. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024, as follows: Probability: 0.4 Event (b) - Vivek Ramaswamy not being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new entrant in the Republican presidential field, and while he has gained some attention, it's uncertain how his campaign will fare. Consider the following: 1. The Republican primary field is likely to be crowded, with more established candidates like Trump, Nikki Haley, and others. 2. Ramaswamy's campaign is still building momentum, and it's unclear if he can sustain a strong challenge. 3. The Republican National Convention often favors more established candidates or those with stronger party connections. However, it's also possible that Ramaswamy could gain significant traction or that the Republican primary field could be more open than expected. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of Vivek Ramaswamy not being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election as follows: Probability: 0.7 Combined probability: To estimate the probability of both events occurring, I'll multiply the individual probabilities: 0.4 (Event a) \u00d7 0.7 (Event b) = 0.28 Reasoning: The combined probability of both events occurring is lower than the individual probabilities, as the occurrence of one event does not directly influence the other.

First, let's consider Vivek Ramaswamy's chances. As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new entrant in the Republican primary field, and his chances of becoming the nominee are difficult to assess. However, we can look at some general trends and factors. Historically, the Republican Party has tended to nominate establishment candidates or those with significant political experience. While Ramaswamy has gained some attention for his business background and conservative views, he still faces significant competition from more established candidates. Additionally, the Republican primary field is likely to be crowded, making it challenging for any single candidate to emerge as the clear frontrunner. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Vivek Ramaswamy becoming the Republican nominee as relatively low, around 0.1-0.2. Now, let's consider Rishi Sunak's chances of failing to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election. As the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Sunak is likely to be a strong candidate in his constituency. However, UK general elections can be unpredictable, and various factors such as local issues, party dynamics, and national trends can influence the outcome. Assuming Sunak remains the leader of the Conservative Party and contests the election, his chances of being re-elected as a Member of Parliament are relatively high. However, there is always a possibility that he might face a strong challenge from an opposing candidate or that local factors might work against him. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of Rishi Sunak failing to be elected as a Member of Parliament as relatively low, around 0.05-0.1. Since the question resolves YES if either of these events occurs, we need to consider the combined probability of both events. Assuming independence between the two events (which might not be entirely accurate, as global political trends can influence each other), we can estimate the combined probability as follows: Combined probability = Probability of Vivek Ramaswamy becoming the Republican nominee + Probability of Rishi Sunak failing to be elected - (Probability of Vivek Ramaswamy becoming the Republican nominee \u00d7 Probability of Rishi Sunak failing to be elected). Using the estimated probabilities above, we get: Combined probability \u2248 0.15 + 0.075 - (0.15 \u00d7 0.075) \u2248 0.2125.

However, since event (a) is related to the election forecast and event (b) is related to Harris's decision, we can assume a low correlation between the two events.

For part (a), the question is whether at least 5 named Democratic House Members or US Senators will pressure Biden to drop out before July 20th, 2024. The provided context suggests that there is already some momentum behind this effort, with two safe-seat members publicly urging Biden out and multiple drafts of letters circulating among House Democrats. However, it is unclear how many of these individuals will ultimately come forward and collectively ask Biden to drop out. Given the current political climate and the fact that some Democrats have already spoken out against Biden's candidacy, I believe it is plausible that at least 5 named Democrats will pressure Biden to drop out before July 20th. However, this is still a relatively high bar to clear, and there is a risk that not enough Democrats will be willing to publicly speak out against Biden. For part (b), the question is whether Nvidia's market capitalization will be less than or equal to Apple's on July 17, 2024. As of the current date (July 5, 2024), Nvidia's market capitalization is significantly lower than Apple's. However, the stock market can be highly volatile, and it is possible that Nvidia's stock price could surge in the coming weeks, potentially closing the gap with Apple. That being said, I believe it is unlikely that Nvidia's market capitalization will surpass Apple's in the next two weeks, given the current trends and market conditions. Given these assessments, I believe that both (a) and (b) are plausible but not guaranteed outcomes. To estimate the probability of both occurring, I will use a rough estimate of the probability of each event occurring individually and then multiply them together. For part (a), I estimate the probability of at least 5 named Democrats pressuring Biden to drop out before July 20th to be around 0.4 (40%). This is a relatively high probability, but it reflects the current momentum behind this effort and the fact that some Democrats have already spoken out against Biden's candidacy. For part (b), I estimate the probability of Nvidia's market capitalization being less than or equal to Apple's on July 17, 2024 to be around 0.7 (70%). This is a relatively high probability, but it reflects the current market trends and conditions. Multiplying these probabilities together, I get: 0.4 (part a) x 0.7 (part b) = 0.28.

First, let's consider Sha'Carri Richardson's chances of winning a gold medal. She is a talented sprinter, but the competition in the women's 100m and 4x100m relay events is fierce. Assuming she is in top form and makes it to the finals, her chances of winning gold in the 100m event are around 20-30% (based on her past performances and the strength of the competition). In the 4x100m relay, the US team is usually strong, but there are many factors that can affect the outcome, such as baton exchanges and team strategy. Let's assume her chances of winning gold in the relay are around 40-50%. Now, let's consider France's chances of placing in the top 5 of the medal table. France has a strong Olympic team and is usually a top-5 contender. However, the medal table can be unpredictable, and many factors can influence the outcome, such as the performance of other countries and the number of medals awarded in each sport. Assuming France has a strong team and performs well, their chances of placing in the top 5 are around 60-70%. Since the question resolves positively if either event occurs, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of these events happening. We can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B).

As of my last update in April 2023, the European Parliament's composition reflects a diverse range of political groups, with the European People's Party (EPP), the Socialists and Democrats (S&D), and Renew Europe being among the largest. The GUE/NGL (European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left) and the Greens\u2013EFA (The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance) are smaller but significant groups that have been gaining traction in recent years due to growing concerns over climate change, social inequality, and the need for more progressive policies. However, historically, these two groups have not held the majority of seats in the European Parliament. The EPP and S&D have traditionally been the dominant forces, though their influence has been waning in favor of more fragmented and diverse political representation. Given the current trends and assuming no drastic changes in the political landscape, it's plausible that while GUE/NGL and Greens\u2013EFA might gain seats, they still face significant competition from established groups. The probability of either of these groups holding the most seats would depend on several factors, including the success of their campaigns, the turnout of their voter base, and how effectively they can capitalize on the growing demand for progressive and green policies. Without more specific data on current polling, campaign dynamics, and voter sentiment, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

For event (a), we don't have real-time access to the Manifold polls. However, we can make an educated guess based on general knowledge. Historically, the difference in polling numbers between a specific Democratic candidate and a generic Democrat can vary. A 3% difference is not unusually large, but it's also not a guarantee. Without more information about the current polling trends or the specifics of the Manifold polls, it's difficult to estimate the exact probability of this event. However, as a rough estimate, let's assume a 20-30% chance of Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents. For event (b), we can look at current exchange rate trends. As of my knowledge cutoff, the USD/JPY exchange rate has been fluctuating around 140. However, predicting exchange rates can be highly uncertain, and many factors can influence the rate between now and August 9th, 2024. That being said, a 5-10% increase in the exchange rate (from 140 to 145 or higher) is not unprecedented in a short period. Let's assume a 20-40% chance of the USD being worth at least 145 JPY at close on August 9th, 2024. Since the question resolves YES if either event occurs, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Assuming independence between the two events, P(A and B) is approximately equal to P(A) * P(B). Let's use the midpoint of our estimated ranges: P(A) = 0.25 and P(B) = 0.30. Then, P(A and B) \u2248 0.25 * 0.30 = 0.075.

Historically, geomagnetic storms with Kp indices greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 are considered moderate to strong storms. These types of storms can occur at any time, but they are more likely to occur during periods of high solar activity, such as during solar maximum. However, predicting geomagnetic storms, especially their intensity and timing, is challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of the Sun's behavior and the Earth's magnetic field. While we can look at historical trends and current solar activity, there is always a degree of uncertainty involved. Given the time frame of July 17 to July 28, 2024, we are in the midst of the solar cycle 25, which started in December 2019 and is expected to peak around 2025. This period is expected to have increased solar activity, which could lead to more frequent and intense geomagnetic storms. However, without specific data on solar activity forecasts for the exact period in question, it's difficult to provide a precise probability. Generally, moderate to strong geomagnetic storms (Kp > 4 and \u2264 5) are not uncommon during periods of heightened solar activity. Given these considerations, a reasonable estimate for the probability of the strongest geomagnetic storm having a K-index greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 between July 17 and July 28, 2024, would lean towards a moderate chance, considering the expected increased solar activity during this time but also acknowledging the unpredictability of specific storm events."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "ea6d640b-95a0-44fd-9cc2-4328fc17d8a1", "title": "Between July 17 and July 28, 2024, will the strongest geomagnetic storm have a K-index (\"Kp\") greater than 5 and less than or equal to 6?", "body": "This question resolves Yes if the highest Planetary K-index (\"Kp\") between July 17 and July 28, 2024 (inclusive) is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 6, according to the German Research Center for Geosciences in their running 30-day history data product.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:59:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-15T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.35, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability of the strongest geomagnetic storm having a K-index ('Kp') greater than 5 and less than or equal to 6 between July 17 and July 28, 2024, we need to consider historical data on geomagnetic storms and their intensities.

(a) If Joe Biden drops out, will a reliable media outlet cover the story at least 6 hours in advance? This part depends on two factors: (1) whether Joe Biden drops out, and (2) whether a reliable media outlet covers the story at least 6 hours in advance. It is difficult to predict with certainty whether Joe Biden will drop out, but given his age and the fact that he has announced his intention to run for re-election, it is possible he might drop out due to health reasons. Assuming he does drop out, it is likely that a reliable media outlet will cover the story quickly, but they must have access to reliable sources to publish it at least 6 hours in advance.

Event (a) refers to the Month-over-Month US Core CPI increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024. Historical data suggests that the Core CPI has been relatively stable, with most monthly changes ranging between -0.1% and 0.3%. However, there have been instances of larger increases, especially during periods of high inflation.

While there have been some concerns about Biden's age and health, there is no credible evidence to suggest that he is incapacitated. Additionally, the 25th Amendment has only been invoked a handful of times in U.S. history, and never for a situation like this. I'd estimate the probability of this event at around 5%.

Given the timeframe of this question, which extends into mid-2024, there's a possibility that unforeseen circumstances could lead to his withdrawal. However, without specific information suggesting health issues, political scandals, or other factors that might force his withdrawal, it's challenging to assign a high probability to this event. The Democratic Party's nomination process and Biden's intentions to run for re-election as of my knowledge cutoff also suggest a low likelihood of him dropping out voluntarily. Event (b): Chris Christie not being the Republican nominee. As of my last update, the field of potential Republican nominees for the 2024 election was broad, and while Chris Christie has been a notable figure in Republican politics, there was no clear indication that he would secure the nomination. The Republican primary process is highly competitive and unpredictable, with several candidates typically vying for the nomination. Given the uncertainty and the number of potential candidates, it's reasonable to assume that Christie faces significant competition, making his nomination less than certain. Combining the Events: Given the uncertainty and low probability of event (a) occurring, and the competitive nature of the Republican nomination process making event (b) likely but not guaranteed, the combined probability of both events occurring leans towards the lower end of the probability spectrum.

(a) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by end of July 15, 2023: Market Activity and Growth: The growth of traders in a market can be influenced by various factors including the topic's relevance, the time of year, and external promotions. Without specific data on the historical growth rate of this market or similar markets, it's challenging to accurately predict the number of traders. However, given that the question specifies a relatively modest number (377 traders) for a period that allows for natural growth and potential spikes in interest, this condition seems plausible but not guaranteed. Time Frame: The question pertains to a future date (July 15, 2023), allowing ample time for the market to attract new traders. This extended timeframe increases the likelihood of reaching the specified number, assuming consistent or growing interest in the market topic. Likelihood Assessment: Given these considerations, the likelihood of the market reaching at least 377 traders seems moderate to high, but without specific data, it's difficult to assign a precise probability. A rough estimate might place this probability between 60% to 80%. (b) Scotland does not hold an official, sanctioned referendum on independence before May 3, 2024: Political Climate and Precedents: The question of Scottish independence is complex and influenced by political, legal, and social factors. The UK and Scottish governments' stances, public opinion, and legal hurdles all play significant roles. Given the history of tensions and discussions around a second independence referendum, the occurrence of such a referendum is plausible but uncertain. Legal and Political Barriers: The UK government has expressed reluctance to approve a second referendum, and any referendum would require legal and political agreements that are not guaranteed. This increases the likelihood of condition (b) being met, as significant hurdles must be overcome for an official, sanctioned referendum to occur. Likelihood Assessment: Considering the political and legal complexities, the likelihood of Scotland not holding an official, sanctioned referendum before May 3, 2024, seems relatively high, potentially above 70%. Combined Probability: To estimate the combined probability of both conditions being met, we multiply the probabilities of each condition occurring. Assuming a moderate to high probability for condition (a) (let's use 70% as a rough estimate) and a high probability for condition (b) (let's use 75%), the combined probability would be: 0.70 (probability of condition a) * 0.75 (probability of condition b) = 0.525.

For event (a), the likelihood of Scotland holding an official, sanctioned referendum on independence before May 3, 2024, is difficult to predict with certainty. However, we can consider the current political climate and recent developments. The Scottish National Party (SNP) has been pushing for another independence referendum, and there have been discussions about holding one in the near future. However, the UK government has been resistant to granting permission for a referendum. Given the uncertainty and the lack of a clear timeline, I would estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as relatively low, around 0.3. For event (b), the likelihood of the linked market getting at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, 2024, depends on various factors such as the market's current growth rate, user engagement, and overall interest in the topic. Without more specific data on the market's performance, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction. However, assuming the market is relatively new and growing steadily, I would estimate the probability of event (b) occurring as moderate, around 0.5. To combine these probabilities, we can use the formula for the probability of either event A or event B occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

In April 2023, he officially launched his re-election campaign, which suggests that he is committed to seeking the Democratic Party's nomination. Secondly, while it is possible that Biden's health or other personal issues might force him to reconsider his candidacy, there is currently no public indication that this is likely to happen. Lastly, the timing of the question is also important. The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention, typically held in mid-to-late July or early August. It is unlikely that Biden would announce his withdrawal from the nomination process so close to the convention, as this would create significant uncertainty and disruption for the party.

Condition (a) Russia's Control of Chasiv Yar: The current situation in Ukraine is highly dynamic, and control of specific locations can change rapidly. However, as of the knowledge cutoff, Russian forces have been making gains in the region. Assuming this trend continues, it's plausible that Russia could maintain control of Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian military has shown resilience, and it's also possible that they could retake the area or that the front lines could shift in a way that puts Chasiv Yar outside of Russian control.

Historically, both Georgia and Estonia have had varying degrees of success in Eurovision.

Given the lack of specific information about the 2024 contest, we can make an educated guess based on their historical performance. Assuming that both countries will participate with a single entry each in the semi-finals, and considering the general competitiveness of the contest, it's reasonable to estimate that each country has around a 30-40% chance of qualifying for the Grand Final based on historical trends. However, since the question asks about either country qualifying, we need to consider the combined probability. The probability that at least one of them qualifies can be estimated by subtracting the probability that neither qualifies from 1.

For event (a), Francis Suarez is currently a relatively unknown candidate, and it's difficult to predict with certainty whether he will be selected as the Republican nominee. However, historical data suggests that the Republican Party tends to nominate candidates with more experience and name recognition. Given the current field of candidates, it's unlikely that Suarez will be selected as the nominee.

While it's impossible to predict with certainty what the forecast will show on July 19, 2024, it's likely that the model will continue to favor Biden, given his incumbency and the historical advantage that incumbent presidents tend to have in elections. Given these considerations, I estimate that the probability of event (a) occurring is relatively low, around 0.1. The probability of event (b) occurring is higher, around 0.7.

(a) The domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' being higher than that of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' combined: 'Deadpool' (2016) had a domestic box office opening of $132,434,639. 'The Wolverine' (2013) had a domestic box office opening of $53,113,752. The combined total is $185,548,391. Given the success of both 'Deadpool' and the trend of increasing box office numbers for sequels and combined universe movies, it's plausible that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' could exceed this combined total, especially considering the popularity of both characters and the potential for a strong marketing push. However, predicting box office performance can be highly uncertain due to factors like competition, audience fatigue, and the quality of the film itself. Despite these uncertainties, the trend in recent years suggests that well-made, highly anticipated superhero movies tend to perform well at the box office. (b) Taylor Swift not cameoing in 'Deadpool & Wolverine': There's no public information or credible rumors suggesting Taylor Swift's involvement in the movie as of my last update. Cameos can be secretive, but for a figure as public as Taylor Swift, some form of leak or rumor often precedes such appearances. The absence of any information suggesting her involvement leans towards the probability of her not making a cameo. Combining these probabilities: For (a), given the factors mentioned, the probability might lean slightly towards the movie performing well, but with significant uncertainty. A generous estimate might place it around 0.6 or 60%, considering both the potential for success and the risks involved. For (b), without any evidence of her involvement, the probability of Taylor Swift not making a cameo could be estimated higher, around 0.8 or 80%, acknowledging the secrecy around cameos but also the lack of any indication of her participation. To find the combined probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities of each event: 0.6 (probability of the box office condition being met) * 0.8 (probability of Taylor Swift not cameoing) = 0.48. The calculation combines the individual probabilities of the domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' exceeding the combined opening of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine,' and Taylor Swift not making a cameo in the movie.

Event (a) is related to the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) being higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024. Historical data from the St. Louis Fed shows that the VXVCLS has fluctuated over time, with periods of high and low volatility. However, without knowing the current trend or any specific market conditions that may affect the index, it's challenging to make a precise prediction. Nevertheless, considering the index's historical volatility, it's reasonable to assume that there's a moderate chance of it being higher Year-over-Year. Event (b) is related to Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average being less than or equal to 2 or greater than 3 on July 15, 2024. Polling averages can be volatile, and the margin between candidates can fluctuate. However, as of the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), Trump's lead is 2.4 points, which is within the specified range. Given the typical margin of error in polling and the time remaining before the specified date, it's possible that Trump's lead could remain within the specified range or even increase. To combine the probabilities, we need to make an assumption about the independence of the events.

To assess this, we need to consider the factors that might lead to a brokered convention. A brokered convention typically occurs when no candidate secures a majority of the delegates during the primary process, leading to negotiations and potentially multiple rounds of voting at the convention to determine the nominee. Historically, brokered conventions are rare, particularly in recent decades, as the primary process has become more decisive in selecting the nominee. However, the increasing number of candidates and the proportional allocation of delegates in many states can make it difficult for any one candidate to secure a majority outright. Given the current political landscape, with a potentially large field of candidates and the rules of the Democratic primary process, there's a plausible scenario where no candidate achieves a majority of delegates before the convention. This scenario is further complicated by the Super Tuesday primaries, where a significant portion of delegates are allocated, and the impact of early voting and mail-in ballots, which can lead to a more fragmented delegate count. However, it's also important to note that the Democratic Party has made efforts to avoid brokered conventions by encouraging candidates to drop out if they have no viable path to the nomination and by implementing rules aimed at reducing the likelihood of a contested convention. Considering these factors, while there is a reasonable chance of a brokered convention due to the complexities of the primary process and the potential for a crowded field, history suggests that parties often find ways to coalesce around a candidate before the convention."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "7a912e80-ee14-4d6e-b461-2fc081dae9d5", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) 10 or more Democratic Senators call for Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024, and (b) Democrats do not have a brokered convention in 2024?", "body": "(a) Resolution source: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/biden-drop-out-democrats.html\n\nIf at any point before midnight July 20 Central Time, it shows 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out, this condition will resolve to yes.

First, let's consider event (a). The number of world records broken during the Olympics can vary greatly from one edition to another, depending on factors such as the quality of the athletes, the conditions of the events, and the rules of the sports. However, we can look at historical data to get an idea of the average number of world records broken during an Olympics. According to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the average number of world records broken during a Summer Olympics is around 20-25. Given that the 2024 Paris Olympics will feature the best athletes from around the world, it's reasonable to assume that at least 24 world records will be broken. Second, let's consider event (b). France has a strong Olympic tradition and has consistently performed well in the medal table. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, France placed 5th in the medal table, with a total of 34 medals (10 gold, 12 silver, and 12 bronze). While it's difficult to predict with certainty how France will perform in 2024, it's reasonable to assume that they will continue to be a strong contender and have a good chance of placing in the top 5. Given these considerations, I estimate that the probability of at least 24 world records being broken during the Paris Olympics is around 0.6, and the probability of France placing in the top 5 is around 0.7. Since the question resolves YES if either of these events occurs, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

I will break down my reasoning into two parts. Firstly, regarding the Pandemic Agreement, it has been in discussion since 2022 and has gained significant attention and support from various countries and health organizations. However, the approval process can be complex and may involve negotiations and compromises. Considering the timeline and the efforts invested in the agreement, I estimate a moderate to high probability of its approval. Secondly, regarding OpenAI's commitment to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle, the company has already shown a willingness to engage with the righttowarn.ai statement and has made some commitments. However, the question requires a new level of commitment, which may involve more concrete actions or statements. Given OpenAI's history of engagement and the growing importance of transparency and accountability in AI development, I estimate a moderate probability of OpenAI making such a commitment.

The VXVCLS index measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 index over the next 3 months. Historically, the index has been influenced by various market and economic factors, such as interest rates, inflation, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. Looking at the historical data, we can see that the VXVCLS index has been relatively stable over the past few years, with some fluctuations during periods of high market volatility. However, it's difficult to predict with certainty how the index will behave in the future, especially given the current market conditions and potential future developments. That being said, we can make some educated guesses based on current trends and market sentiment. The current market environment is characterized by relatively low interest rates, moderate inflation, and a stable global economy. These conditions are generally conducive to lower volatility, which could suggest that the VXVCLS index may not be significantly higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024. However, there are also potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the index, such as geopolitical tensions, trade wars, and unexpected economic shocks. These events could lead to increased market volatility, which could, in turn, drive up the VXVCLS index.

To answer this question, we need to consider the current political landscape in France and the relationships between these two parties. The Republicans Party is a center-right party that has traditionally been one of the two major parties in French politics, along with the Socialist Party. The National Rally, on the other hand, is a far-right party that has gained significant support in recent years, particularly among voters who are dissatisfied with the traditional parties. In recent years, there have been some signs of cooperation between the Republicans Party and the National Rally. For example, in the 2019 European Parliament election, the two parties formed an electoral alliance in some regions. However, this alliance was not extended to the national level, and the two parties have generally maintained their separate identities and policies. Given the current political climate in France, it is possible that the Republicans Party and the National Rally could form an alliance for the 2024 legislative election. The Republicans Party has been struggling to regain its footing after a series of electoral defeats, and an alliance with the National Rally could potentially help the party to regain some of its lost support. At the same time, the National Rally may see an alliance with the Republicans Party as a way to gain more mainstream credibility and increase its chances of winning seats in the legislature. However, there are also reasons to think that an alliance may not be formed. The Republicans Party has historically been wary of the National Rally's far-right ideology, and some members of the party may be hesitant to form an alliance with a party that they see as too extreme. Additionally, the National Rally has been known to be unpredictable and prone to internal conflicts, which could make it difficult to negotiate a stable alliance. Overall, while there are some signs that an alliance between the Republicans Party and the National Rally is possible, it is far from certain.

Event (a): Larry Elder being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Reasoning: Larry Elder is a well-known figure in the United States, especially in California, where he ran for governor in the 2021 recall election. However, his chances of becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election are uncertain. The Republican National Convention will select the nominee, and the process is inherently unpredictable. While Elder has a dedicated following, the Republican Party has a deep bench of potential candidates, including former President Donald Trump, who may run again.

However, historically, polling averages have been relatively stable in the months leading up to the election. Assuming that the polling average will continue to be a reasonable indicator of the election outcome, the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range (less than or equal to 3 or greater than 4) is difficult to estimate with precision. However, given the uncertainty and the fact that polling averages can be volatile, I estimate the probability of this event as roughly 50%. Probability: 0.5.

The US, in particular, has a good track record in sports like basketball, volleyball, and soccer. However, the Olympics are inherently unpredictable, and other nations like Australia, Great Britain, and Japan also have competitive teams. That being said, the US women's national teams have been dominant in several sports, and it's likely they will win at least one gold medal.

For event (1), recent news and updates suggest that Joe Biden has been preparing for his re-election campaign. Although there have been some concerns about his age and health, there is no strong indication that he plans to drop out of the race. Given the proximity of the July 15 deadline, it is increasingly unlikely that Biden will make such an announcement.

(a) The closing value of the BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024, being greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000: Predicting stock market indices with precision, especially more than three years in advance, is extremely challenging due to the vast array of influencing factors, including economic indicators, political stability, global events, and investor sentiment. However, we can consider historical trends and volatility to make an educated guess. The BSE SENSEX has shown significant growth over the years, with periods of high volatility. Given the long-term growth trend of the Indian economy and the stock market, it's plausible that the SENSEX could reach or exceed 75,000 by July 2024. However, pinpointing a range as specific as 75,000 to 77,000 is highly speculative. For the sake of estimation, let's consider the historical volatility and growth trends, and assume there's a reasonable chance it could fall within this range, but acknowledge the wide uncertainty. (b) Donald Trump not being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: This part of the question is highly speculative and depends on political dynamics that are difficult to predict far in advance. Factors such as Trump's health, political climate, potential challengers, and the sentiment of the Republican Party base at the time of the convention will all play a role. As of my last update, there was significant uncertainty around Trump's intentions and the field of potential Republican candidates for 2024. Given these uncertainties, it's difficult to assign a high probability to either outcome (Trump being the nominee or not) with confidence. However, considering the natural churn in political landscapes and the potential for new candidates to emerge, there's a plausible argument that Trump might not secure the nomination. Combining the Probabilities: Both events are independent of each other, so we can multiply their probabilities to find the probability of both occurring. However, given the speculative nature of both predictions, we're dealing with rough estimates rather than precise probabilities. For event (a), let's conservatively estimate a 20% chance, reflecting the uncertainty and specificity of the stock market prediction. For event (b), given the fluidity of political situations, let's also conservatively estimate a 40% chance, acknowledging the uncertainty and the time frame involved. Combining these gives us a rough estimate of 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08, or 8%. Reasoning: The estimation involves significant uncertainty due to the speculative nature of both the stock market prediction and political forecasting. The probabilities assigned are conservative and intended to reflect the broad uncertainty in predicting such specific outcomes far in advance."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "6eaa4364-863d-408d-aef4-65c275ee0948", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election (b) On July 21, 2024, the closing value of BSE SENSEX will be greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, without access to real-time market data or specific information about the current state of the Indian economy and global markets as of the question's creation in 2020, providing an accurate forecast is challenging. Given the time frame between the creation of the question (August 2020) and the resolution date (July 2024), there are many factors that could influence the BSE SENSEX, including economic policies, global events, and market fluctuations. The BSE SENSEX has historically shown significant volatility, with the ability to fluctuate widely over short periods. However, without current data, we must rely on general principles. The probability of the index falling within a specific range (greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000) on a particular day is relatively low due to the inherent volatility of the market.

Historically, FiveThirtyEight's forecast has been relatively stable, with the leading candidate maintaining a consistent lead in the forecast.

Part (a): Meta publishes a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024. Reasoning: This part of the question requires two conditions to be met: (1) Meta must publish a report, and (2) the report must be based on external red-teaming of their AI models for safety. Given the current trends in AI safety and the increasing scrutiny of large AI model developers, it's plausible that Meta would engage in such an effort to demonstrate transparency and commitment to safety. However, the specific timeline (by June 30, 2024) adds a layer of uncertainty. Companies like Meta often have complex internal processes and may not always meet self-imposed deadlines for external-facing reports. Despite this, the growing importance of AI safety could expedite such a report. Probability for part (a) happening: 0.4 Part (b): The linked market gets at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, 2024. Reasoning: Predicting the number of traders in a specific market by a certain date involves many variables, including the market's appeal, the overall interest in the topic, and the ease of participation. Without specific data on the market's current growth rate or its popularity, this prediction leans heavily on general trends in similar markets. However, given the niche nature of the topic (interest in the safety of AI models and the specifics of trading markets related to such topics), reaching 377 traders might not be overly ambitious, especially considering the time frame allows for organic growth and potential surges in interest. Probability for part (b) happening: 0.55 Combining Probabilities: Since the question resolves YES if either (a) or (b) occurs, we're looking for the probability of at least one of these events happening. A straightforward way to approximate this, assuming independence between the two events, is to calculate the probability that neither event happens and subtract that from 1. Probability of (a) not happening: 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 Probability of (b) not happening: 1 - 0.55 = 0.45 Probability of neither happening: 0.6 * 0.45 = 0.27 Probability of at least one happening: 1 - 0.27 = 0.73.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the current polling trends and the historical variability of polling averages. As of the knowledge cutoff in 2022, the 2024 presidential election is still far away, and polling data is limited. However, we can look at the historical trends of polling averages in previous presidential elections. Typically, polling averages tend to be volatile and can fluctuate significantly over time. Assuming that the polling average on July 15, 2024, will be a random variable with a mean of 0 (i.e., a tie between Trump and Biden) and a standard deviation of around 2-3 points (based on historical data), we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3. Using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 2.5 (a rough estimate), we can calculate the probability of Trump's lead being between 2 and 3 as follows: P(2 < Trump's lead \u2264 3) = P(2 < X \u2264 3) = \u03a6(3/2.5) - \u03a6(2/2.5) \u2248 0.1587 - 0.0774 \u2248 0.0813, where \u03a6(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

For event (a), we need to consider the current polling trends and the historical volatility of presidential election polls. As of the question's creation date (June 1, 2024), the 538 national polling average shows Biden leading Trump by around 5-6 points. However, it's essential to note that polls can fluctuate significantly over time, and a 2-3 point lead for Trump is within the realm of possibility.

For event (a), historical data from the St. Louis Fed shows that the VXVCLS has fluctuated over time, with no clear long-term trend. However, given the current global economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, it's possible that volatility could increase. That being said, predicting the exact value of the VXVCLS on a specific date is challenging, if not impossible. Nevertheless, I'll assign a moderate probability to this event occurring, given the uncertain economic outlook. For event (b), the likelihood of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, is difficult to estimate. While there have been tensions between Israel and Iran in the past, and Israel has conducted strikes against Iranian targets in Syria and other countries, the likelihood of such an attack occurring within Iran's borders before the specified date is uncertain. I'll assign a relatively low probability to this event, given the lack of concrete evidence or credible reports suggesting such an attack is imminent. Considering both events, I'll estimate the probability of either event occurring as follows: Probability of event (a) occurring: 0.4 (moderate uncertainty) Probability of event (b) occurring: 0.2 (relatively low uncertainty). Since the question resolves YES if either event occurs, I'll use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Assuming the events are independent, P(A \u2229 B) is approximately 0.08 (0.4 \u00d7 0.2).

Condition 1: Joe Biden still being president by the end of July 2024. As of the creation date (July 3, 2021), Joe Biden has just started his presidency, and it's reasonable to assume that he will complete his term unless unforeseen circumstances arise. The most likely reasons for him not being president by the end of July 2024 would be: Resignation or impeachment: While possible, these events are relatively rare and often require significant political momentum or scandals. Given the current political climate, it's difficult to predict the likelihood of such events. Health issues or death: Unfortunately, this is a possibility, but it's also difficult to predict. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Joe Biden still being president by the end of July 2024 as relatively high, around 0.8-0.9. Condition 2: Nikki Haley not being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. As of the creation date, Nikki Haley is a prominent Republican figure, but it's uncertain whether she will run for president in 2024 or whether she will be selected as the nominee. The Republican nomination process is inherently unpredictable, with many factors influencing the outcome, such as: Other strong candidates: The Republican field may include other popular and well-funded candidates, making it challenging for Haley to secure the nomination. Party dynamics: The Republican Party's internal dynamics, including the influence of different factions and interest groups, can affect the nomination process. Given these uncertainties, I would estimate the probability of Nikki Haley not being the Republican nominee as relatively high, around 0.7-0.8. Combining the probabilities: To estimate the probability of both conditions being met, we can multiply the individual probabilities: 0.85 (Joe Biden still being president) \u00d7 0.75 (Nikki Haley not being the Republican nominee) \u2248 0.64.

First, let's consider the scenario of Nikki Haley becoming the Republican nominee. While Haley has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, the nomination process is highly unpredictable and influenced by various factors, including primary elections, party politics, and delegate votes. Given the uncertainty and the fact that the nomination process is still ongoing, it's challenging to assign a high probability to Haley securing the nomination. On the other hand, considering Joe Biden still being president by the end of July 2024, we can look at the historical context and the typical presidential term. Presidents typically serve a four-year term, and Biden's term is set to end on January 20, 2025.

(a) OpenAI's ChatGPT being generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024: OpenAI has been actively developing and expanding its services, including ChatGPT. Given the growing demand for AI-powered tools and the company's efforts to increase accessibility, it's reasonable to assume that OpenAI will continue to work towards making ChatGPT widely available. However, there are potential regulatory hurdles and data protection concerns in the EU that might impact the availability of ChatGPT. Despite these challenges, I believe that OpenAI will likely find ways to address these concerns and make ChatGPT generally available in the EU by June 30, 2024. My reasoning is based on the company's track record of innovation and its commitment to expanding access to its services. (b) Greens\u2013EFA not holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections: The Greens\u2013EFA political group has been gaining popularity in recent years, but predicting the outcome of elections is inherently uncertain. While it's difficult to make a precise prediction, I'll rely on historical trends and the current political landscape. Given the uncertainty surrounding elections and the potential for unexpected events to influence the outcome, I'll assign a lower probability to the Greens\u2013EFA group not holding the most seats. However, it's still a plausible scenario. Combined Probability: To estimate the combined probability of both events occurring, I'll multiply the individual probabilities. Based on my reasoning, I assign: Probability of ChatGPT being generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024: 0.7 (70%), Probability of Greens\u2013EFA not holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections: 0.4 (40%).

For condition (a), it's difficult to predict the outcome of the European Parliament elections, as it depends on various factors such as voter turnout, party popularity, and coalition formations. However, based on current trends and past election results, it's unlikely that the Greens\u2013EFA group will hold the most seats. In the 2019 European Parliament elections, the Greens\u2013EFA group won around 10% of the seats, while the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) won around 20% each. While the Greens\u2013EFA group has been gaining popularity, it's still a long shot for them to become the largest group.

OpenAI has been expanding its services, and it's possible that ChatGPT will become more widely available in the EU by June 30, 2024. However, there are also regulatory and technical challenges that might hinder its availability. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of condition (a) occurring as around 0.2 (20%), and the probability of condition (b) occurring as around 0.6 (60%). Since the question resolves YES if either condition occurs, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of them happening.

Given this timeframe and the lack of concrete data, any prediction would be highly speculative. However, we can consider historical trends and the general volatility of political polling averages. Typically, polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, campaign events, and external global or national events.

Firstly, Glenn Youngkin is currently the Governor of Virginia and has not yet announced his candidacy for the 2024 US Presidential Election. While he has been mentioned as a potential candidate, it is unclear whether he will actually run. Even if he does run, it is uncertain whether he will win the Republican nomination. Therefore, the probability of Glenn Youngkin being the Republican nominee is relatively low. Secondly, the 538 national polling average is a dynamic metric that can fluctuate over time. As of the current date (June 28, 2023), the polling average shows Biden leading Trump by a small margin.

Event (b) - Fewer than 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early: This event is more likely to occur if there is significant opposition to the virtual nomination plan within the party. However, given the current level of support for Biden and the party's efforts to present a united front, I estimate the probability of fewer than 20 Democrats opposing the plan at around 0.7. Combining the probabilities: Since the events are not mutually exclusive, we can multiply the probabilities to get the combined probability. However, this assumes independence, which might not be the case here. To be conservative, let's use a slightly lower estimate."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "888acf23-49b5-4a50-b321-0760e3fa4c71", "title": "Will either at least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early, or will Democrats have a brokered convention in 2024?", "body": "This is a combination of two questions:\n\n1.

Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO, offers the first public signal from Democrats since the weekend\u2019s attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump that scores of their own members remain deeply unsettled about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy.\n   - \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad move by the DNC.

Historically, Switzerland has had mixed results in Eurovision, with some years seeing them qualify for the Grand Final and others not. However, in recent years, Switzerland has shown improvement, with their 2021 entry \"Tout l'univers\" by Gjon's Tears finishing 3rd in the Grand Final. This suggests that Switzerland has the potential to produce high-quality entries that can compete with other countries. For the 2024 contest, Switzerland has selected the song \"Blood & Bitter Orange\" by Remo Forrer. While it's difficult to predict the quality of the song without hearing it, Switzerland's recent success suggests that they may have a strong entry. In terms of competition, the semi-finals for Eurovision 2024 will feature a total of 31 countries, with 10 spots available in the Grand Final. This means that Switzerland will need to finish in the top 10 of their semi-final to qualify. Given these factors, I estimate that Switzerland has a reasonable chance of qualifying for the Grand Final, but it's not a guarantee."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "de5b4409-22eb-4259-94c2-23b62031dbaa", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Portugal qualifies for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024, and (b) Switzerland fails to qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (a) Portugal participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, and (b) Switzerland does not qualify for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

In 2021, they finished third with the song 'Tout l'univers' by Gjon's Tears, and in 2022, they finished 17th with the song 'Boys Do Cry' by Marius Bear. While their performance can be unpredictable, they have a good chance of qualifying for the Grand Final. Portugal, on the other hand, has had a more mixed record in Eurovision. They won the competition in 2017 with the song 'Amar Pelos Dois' by Salvador Sobral, but have not had the same level of success in recent years. In 2021, they failed to qualify for the Grand Final with the song 'Love Is on My Side' by The Black Mamba, and in 2022, they finished 9th with the song 'Saudade, saudade' by MARO.
