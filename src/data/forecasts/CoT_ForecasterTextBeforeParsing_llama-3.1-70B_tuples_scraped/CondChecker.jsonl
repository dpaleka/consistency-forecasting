Given this, it's unlikely that he would suddenly reverse his decision and announce that he won't accept the nomination before July 15, 2024.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The key factors to consider are: 1. Legal Basis: The legal basis for such a removal is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This section has been used historically to disqualify individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion. However, its application to a former president is unprecedented and would likely face significant legal challenges. 2. Political Climate: The political climate in the U.S. is highly polarized, and any attempt to remove Trump from the ballot would be highly contentious. This could affect the likelihood of such an action being taken, as it would require significant political will and coordination. 3. Legal Challenges: Any attempt to remove Trump from the ballot under Section 3 would likely face legal challenges. Trump and his allies would likely argue that the application of this section to a former president is unconstitutional or that his actions do not meet the legal definition of insurrection or rebellion. 4. State-Level Actions: The question specifies that the removal or block must occur at the state level. This means that individual states would need to take action, which could be influenced by local political considerations and the legal framework of each state. Given these factors, the likelihood of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, seems low.

The question is asking about the probability that both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson will be the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election. To assess this probability, we need to consider the current political landscape and the processes involved in selecting nominees. Firstly, it's important to note that the Republican National Convention is the event where the party's nominees are officially selected. The convention is typically attended by delegates from each state, who are chosen by the state's Republican Party. These delegates then vote on the nominees. Currently, Donald Trump Jr. is not a declared candidate for the 2024 presidential election, and while he has expressed interest in running, it's unclear if he will actually throw his hat into the ring. Asa Hutchinson, on the other hand, has not publicly expressed interest in running for president. Given these factors, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson being selected as nominees. However, we can consider some general trends and historical context. Historically, the Republican Party has tended to nominate candidates who have a strong track record of political experience and a established reputation within the party. While Donald Trump Jr. has some political experience, his father's presidency and his own involvement in politics, he is not a traditional politician and may not have the same level of support among party insiders. Asa Hutchinson, on the other hand, has a long history of political experience, having served as a congressman, governor, and senator, but he has not been a major player in national politics in recent years. Furthermore, the Republican Party has a history of nominating candidates who are seen as electable and able to appeal to a broad range of voters. While both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson have their own strengths and weaknesses, it's unclear if they would be seen as the most electable candidates by party insiders. Considering these factors, I would argue that the probability of both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson being selected as nominees is relatively low.

Firstly, it's worth noting that the Olympics have been held for over a century, and many countries have already won medals and gold medals in various sports. However, with the increasing participation of new countries and the growth of sports infrastructure globally, it's possible that new countries may win their first medals and gold medals. Historically, the number of countries winning their first Olympic medals and gold medals has been relatively small. According to the Olympic Games' official website, between 2012 and 2020, an average of 2-3 countries won their first-ever Olympic medals, and around 1-2 countries won their first-ever Olympic gold medals per Olympics. Given this historical context, it seems challenging for at least 5 countries to win their first Olympic medals and at least 5 countries to win their first gold medals in a single Olympics. However, it's essential to consider the following factors that could contribute to a higher number of countries achieving this feat: 1. Increased participation: The 2024 Olympics may see participation from more countries than ever before, which could lead to a higher number of countries winning their first medals and gold medals. 2. Growing sports infrastructure: Many countries have invested heavily in sports infrastructure, coaching, and training programs, which could lead to improved performances and a higher likelihood of winning medals. 3. New sports and events: The 2024 Olympics may feature new sports and events, which could provide opportunities for countries to win their first medals and gold medals. Considering these factors, while it's still a challenging task, it's not impossible for at least 5 countries to win their first Olympic medals and at least 5 countries to win their first gold medals.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the relationship between the qualification of Greece and Lithuania. First, it's essential to note that the qualification process for Eurovision is based on a combination of jury and public voting. Each country's qualification is determined by its performance in its respective semi-final. There is no direct correlation between Greece's qualification and Lithuania's qualification, as they are two separate countries with different performances and voting patterns. However, we can consider some indirect factors that might influence the probability. One factor is the voting patterns of countries in the same semi-final. If Greece and Lithuania are in the same semi-final, it's possible that countries that voted for Greece might also vote for Lithuania, and vice versa. However, this is not a strong correlation, as voting patterns can vary greatly from year to year and are influenced by many factors, including the performance, song quality, and cultural biases. Another factor is the overall strength of the competition in the semi-final. If the semi-final is particularly strong, it might be more challenging for Lithuania to qualify, regardless of Greece's qualification. Given these considerations, it's challenging to establish a strong correlation between Greece's qualification and Lithuania's qualification. Therefore, I will rely on general historical data and the fact that both countries have a relatively similar qualification rate in recent years. According to the Eurovision database, Greece has qualified for the Grand Final in 7 out of the last 10 years (2014-2023), while Lithuania has qualified in 5 out of the last 10 years.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, GUE/NGL won 41 seats, making it the fifth-largest group in the parliament. To assess the likelihood of GUE/NGL holding the most seats in 2024, we need to consider several factors: 1. Current trends: The European Parliament has historically been dominated by center-right and center-left parties. While GUE/NGL has gained seats in recent elections, it still lags behind the larger groups. 2. Electoral system: The European Parliament uses a proportional representation system, which tends to favor larger parties. Smaller parties like GUE/NGL often struggle to gain a significant number of seats. 3. Competition: The European Parliament has several other left-wing groups, such as the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and the Greens/European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA), which may compete with GUE/NGL for seats. 4. National politics: The European Parliament elections are often influenced by national politics and issues. If national governments are dominated by center-right or center-left parties, it may be challenging for GUE/NGL to gain significant support.

Considering the number of participants in the semi-finals (around 18 in each semi-final) and the number of spots available in the Grand Final (10 from each semi-final), the probability of a single country qualifying is around 10/18 or approximately 55.56%.

Moreover, the Republican National Convention's selection process is complex and influenced by various factors, including delegate votes, party loyalty, and strategic considerations. While Ramaswamy may have some support within the party, it is uncertain whether he could garner enough support to overcome Trump's advantage. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Vivek Ramaswamy being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, given the specified condition, to be relatively low."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "d89df87c-c023-4eef-83bd-9065a7c254f9", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, and (b) Vivek Ramaswamy be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's [national polling average for the 2024 presidential election](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/) as reported on the chart for the date of July 15, 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024.

Given the current political landscape and the fact that the election is still over a year away, it's challenging to predict the exact polling numbers.

Assuming that the polling average will continue to fluctuate, I estimate the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4) to be around 10%. This is a relatively narrow range, and there are many factors that could influence the polling numbers between now and July 15, 2024. Event (b) refers to Vivek Ramaswamy being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. As of now, Ramaswamy is not a well-known candidate, and the Republican primary field is still taking shape. While it's possible that he could gain momentum and become a viable candidate, it's difficult to assess his chances at this point. I estimate the probability of Ramaswamy being selected as the Republican nominee to be around 5%. This is a rough estimate, as the primary process is inherently unpredictable, and many factors can influence the outcome. Considering the two events together, it's essential to acknowledge that they are not entirely independent. The outcome of the Republican primary could potentially impact the general election polling numbers.

Event (a): Another Democratic party presidential debate takes place before the 2024 Democratic National Convention. Given the typical presidential election cycle, debates are common, especially during the primary season. The 2024 Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 2024. Considering the usual debate schedule in previous election cycles, it's likely that there will be at least one more debate before the convention. However, the exact number and timing of debates can be influenced by various factors, such as the number of candidates, their popularity, and the Democratic National Committee's decisions. Event (b): If Joe Biden drops out, a reliable media outlet covers the story at least 6 hours in advance. This event is conditional on Joe Biden dropping out, which is uncertain. Assuming he does drop out, it's likely that a reliable media outlet will cover the story in advance. Major news outlets often have sources close to the candidates and the party, which can provide them with early information about significant developments like a candidate's withdrawal. A 6-hour advance notice is a reasonable timeframe, considering the typical news cycle and the time it takes for news to spread. Since both events need to occur for the question to resolve YES, we'll consider the joint probability. Assuming some degree of independence between the two events (although they might be related through the overall dynamics of the election), we can estimate the joint probability as the product of the individual probabilities. Probability of event (a): 0.7 (given the typical debate schedule and the time left before the convention) Probability of event (b): 0.8 (assuming Joe Biden drops out, considering the likelihood of reliable media outlets covering the story in advance). Joint probability: 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56. However, we need to account for the fact that event (b) is conditional on Joe Biden dropping out, which is uncertain. To incorporate this uncertainty, we'll adjust the joint probability by the estimated probability of Joe Biden dropping out. This probability is difficult to estimate accurately, but for the sake of this exercise, let's assume it's around 0.3 (30%). Adjusted joint probability: 0.56 * 0.3 = 0.168.

However, several considerations can guide our reasoning: 1. Historical Context: Israel has a history of conducting military operations against targets it perceives as threats, including within Iran. The most notable example is the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and the bombing of nuclear facilities. This history suggests that Israel is willing to take action when it feels its security interests are at stake. 2. Current Tensions: The question doesn't specify the current state of tensions between Israel and Iran as of its publication date. However, it's well-documented that tensions between Israel and Iran have been high for many years, with both countries engaging in a shadow war across the Middle East. This ongoing tension increases the likelihood of military action. 3. Threshold for Deadly Attack: The question specifies that the attack must result in at least five deaths. Given the nature of military operations, achieving this threshold is plausible if Israel were to target significant military or strategic assets within Iran. 4. Uncertainty and Secrecy: Military operations, especially those of a sensitive nature, are often planned and executed with utmost secrecy. This means that even if such an operation is planned, it might not be publicly known until after its execution, or perhaps never if it's sufficiently covert. 5. Timeframe: The question specifies a timeframe of approximately two weeks from its publication date to May 1, 2024. This is a relatively short window for planning and executing a significant military operation, especially one that would result in at least five deaths and be attributed to Israel. However, it's not impossible, especially if plans are already in place or if Israel feels compelled to act quickly in response to a perceived threat. Given these considerations, while there's a historical precedent for Israel taking military action against targets in Iran, the short timeframe and the inherent secrecy surrounding military operations make it difficult to assign a high probability to such an event occurring within the specified timeframe.

The first event is a geopolitical incident that could potentially have significant consequences. If such an attack were to occur, it's likely that major news outlets would cover the story extensively. The second event, Joe Biden dropping out of the presidential race, is a significant political development that would also likely receive widespread media coverage.

Ted Cruz's Nomination Impact: Ted Cruz's nomination might influence Biden's decision, but it's unlikely to be a significant factor. Cruz's nomination would likely be seen as a more polarizing choice, potentially energizing both Republican and Democratic bases. However, this alone might not be enough to deter Biden from seeking re-election, given the broader political landscape and the Democratic Party's desire to retain the presidency. 2. Biden's Health and Age: As of my last update, Joe Biden's health and age have been subjects of public discussion. If his health were to decline significantly or if age becomes a more pronounced concern, this could influence his decision to run. However, this factor is independent of Ted Cruz's nomination. 3. Democratic Party Dynamics: The desire within the Democratic Party for Biden to run again could influence his decision. If there's strong support for him to seek re-election, he might be less likely to announce he won't accept the nomination. Conversely, if there's significant opposition or a strong desire for a new candidate, this could sway his decision. Ted Cruz's nomination is unlikely to be a decisive factor in these internal party dynamics. 4. Biden's Personal Decision: Ultimately, Biden's decision would be influenced by his personal desire to continue in office, his assessment of his chances of winning, and his health. While being a complex interplay of factors, Ted Cruz's nomination might not significantly alter these personal considerations. Considering these factors, the influence of Ted Cruz's nomination on Biden's decision to accept or decline the Democratic nomination seems minimal. The decision would likely be based more on Biden's personal considerations, his health, and the broader political landscape rather than the specific Republican nominee.

To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between Trump's performance in the polls and his likelihood of testifying at the trial. Firstly, it's important to note that the polls in question are hypothetical and may not reflect real-world voting behavior. Additionally, the outcome of the polls may not have any direct impact on Trump's decision to testify at the trial. That being said, if Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat, it could be seen as a positive sign for his campaign. However, this does not necessarily mean that he will testify at the trial. The decision to testify is likely to be influenced by a variety of factors, including legal strategy, public relations, and personal considerations. Given the lack of a clear connection between Trump's performance in the polls and his likelihood of testifying at the trial, I would argue that the probability of him testifying is relatively low.

Event (a): Month-over-Month US Core CPI increases by more than 0.1% in July 2024. Historical data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) shows that the Month-over-Month US Core CPI has been relatively stable, with most monthly changes ranging from -0.1% to 0.3%. Given the current economic conditions and inflation trends, it's reasonable to assume that the July 2024 Core CPI will likely increase, but the magnitude of the increase is uncertain. Assuming a normal distribution of monthly Core CPI changes, I'd estimate the probability of an increase greater than 0.1% as follows: Mean monthly change: 0.15% (based on historical data), Standard deviation: 0.1% (rough estimate). Using a normal distribution calculator or software, I find that the probability of a monthly change greater than 0.1% is approximately 0.64 (or 64%). Event (b): Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024. This event is much more uncertain and depends on various factors, including the President's health, political dynamics, and the actions of the Vice President and Cabinet members. While there have been some calls for invoking the 25th Amendment, including the recent request from a GOP lawmaker, it's essential to note that this is a rare and extraordinary measure. The 25th Amendment has only been invoked a handful of times in U.S. history, and usually, it requires a significant and widely acknowledged incapacitation of the President. Given the current information and the lack of concrete evidence suggesting Biden's incapacitation, I'd estimate the probability of this event as relatively low, around 0.05 (or 5%). Combined probability: To estimate the probability of both events occurring, we need to multiply the individual probabilities: 0.64 (Event a) \u00d7 0.05 (Event b) \u2248 0.032.

Condition (a) involves Biden dropping out or being unable to continue the race before July 20, 2024. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can consider the following factors: Biden's current health and age: As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, Biden is 80 years old. While age is not a definitive indicator of health, it does increase the likelihood of health issues. However, Biden has shown remarkable resilience and energy in his public appearances. Biden's commitment to his presidency: Despite facing criticism and challenges, Biden has consistently expressed his dedication to serving as President. Political landscape: The political climate can be unpredictable, and unforeseen events might impact Biden's ability to continue his presidency. However, as of my knowledge cutoff, there are no significant indications that Biden is planning to drop out or is unable to continue. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of condition (a) being met as relatively low, around 0.2. Condition (b) involves Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024. To assess this, let's consider the following: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This section, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. Trump's involvement in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot and his subsequent actions have sparked debates about his eligibility under this clause. Ongoing investigations and lawsuits: As of my knowledge cutoff, there are ongoing investigations and lawsuits related to Trump's actions, including the January 6th Committee's findings and the Georgia election interference case. These could potentially lead to Trump being removed or blocked from the ballot. State-by-state decisions: The decision to remove or block Trump from the ballot would need to be made by individual states, which could lead to varying outcomes. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of condition (b) being met as moderate, around 0.4. To calculate the probability of both conditions being met, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.2 (condition a) * 0.4 (condition b) = 0.08.

However, the Eurovision voting system is notoriously unpredictable, and many factors can influence a country's chances of qualifying, such as the quality of their song, the performance, and the voting patterns of the other countries. Moreover, the question does not provide any information about the song or the artist that will represent Poland in Eurovision 2024, which is a crucial factor in determining their chances of qualifying. Without this information, it is difficult to make an accurate assessment of Poland's chances. Given these considerations, I will rely on Poland's historical performance in Eurovision and their dedicated fan base to inform my estimate. However, I will also acknowledge the uncertainty and unpredictability of the competition by assigning a relatively modest probability."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "5d55159d-a5c0-4c39-a7b8-e3dddfa5ccf2", "title": "Given Poland qualifies for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024, will Ireland also qualify?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Poland participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the relationship between Poland's qualification and Ireland's chances of qualifying. In the Eurovision Song Contest, each country's qualification chances are largely independent of other countries, as the qualification process is based on a combination of jury and public voting. However, it's possible that some countries may have an advantage or disadvantage due to various factors such as cultural or linguistic ties, voting patterns, or the quality of their song. Given that Poland has qualified, it's likely that the voting patterns and jury scores in their semi-final were favorable to them. However, this does not necessarily imply that Ireland will also qualify, as they may be in a different semi-final or have a different set of competitors. Without more information about the specific semi-finals, song qualities, and voting patterns, it's difficult to estimate the exact probability of Ireland qualifying. However, we can make a rough estimate based on historical data. In recent years, the qualification rate for countries in the Eurovision semi-finals has been around 50-60%.

This means that a swimmer has more opportunities to win multiple gold medals compared to athletes in sports with fewer events, such as marathon running. Additionally, swimming has historically been a sport where athletes can win multiple gold medals, with notable examples including Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky.

The combined opening of \"Deadpool\" (2016) and \"The Wolverine\" (2013) is $185,548,391. To determine the likelihood of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" surpassing this amount, let's consider a few factors: The original \"Deadpool\" film was a massive success, grossing over $782 million worldwide, with a significant portion of that coming from the domestic box office. The sequel, \"Deadpool 2,\" also performed well, grossing over $785 million worldwide. The \"X-Men\" franchise, which includes \"The Wolverine,\" has a dedicated fan base and has consistently performed well at the box office. The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine in a single film is likely to attract a large audience, as both characters have a strong following. The superhero genre has continued to perform well in recent years, with many films in the genre opening to large box office numbers. Considering these factors, it's reasonable to assume that \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" will have a strong opening weekend. However, surpassing the combined opening of \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine\" is a challenging task. I estimate the probability of this event occurring as 0.6 (60%). Event (b): M. Night Shyamalan's \"Trap\" (2024) receives a CinemaScore of B or above. M. Night Shyamalan's recent films have received mixed CinemaScores, with \"Split\" and \"Glass\" receiving B+ and B, respectively, while \"Old\" and \"Knock at the Cabin\" received C+ and C, respectively. This inconsistency makes it difficult to predict the CinemaScore for \"Trap\" with high confidence. However, considering Shyamalan's reputation for crafting engaging stories and the positive reception of his recent films, I estimate the probability of \"Trap\" receiving a CinemaScore of B or above as 0.55 (55%). Combined probability: To estimate the probability of both events occurring, I'll multiply the individual probabilities: 0.6 (Event a) \u00d7 0.55 (Event b) = 0.33 (33%). Reasoning: Given the factors discussed above, I believe that \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" has a reasonable chance of surpassing the combined opening of \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine,\" while M. Night Shyamalan's \"Trap\" has a slightly lower chance of receiving a CinemaScore of B or above. The combined probability of both events occurring is approximately 33%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.03173803627134348, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, without specific information about the songs, artists, or voting trends for Eurovision 2024, we must rely on general historical data and the structure of the contest. In Eurovision, the qualification from the semi-finals to the Grand Final is determined by a combination of jury and public voting. The top 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final. The voting patterns can be influenced by various factors, including the quality of the song, performance, cultural and geographical bloc voting, and more. Malta and Serbia have had varying degrees of success in Eurovision. Malta has generally been more successful, often qualifying for the Grand Final and occasionally achieving high rankings. Serbia also has a good track record, especially considering its participation in the contest as an independent nation. Given that Malta's qualification does not directly influence Serbia's chances (other than indicating the competitiveness of the semi-final Malta was in, which could indirectly affect the perception of song quality and performance standards), the probability of Serbia qualifying is largely independent of Malta's qualification. However, without specific details on the entries, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. Historically, about 50% of participating countries qualify for the Grand Final each year, considering there are two semi-finals and 20-25 spots available in the Grand Final (depending on the year and the number of participating countries). However, this is a very general guideline and does not account for the specific strengths and weaknesses of each country's entry. Given these considerations, a reasonable estimate would be based on Serbia's historical performance and the general competitiveness of the contest.

(a) The linked market getting at least 377 traders by the end of July 15: - Market Size and Growth: The market in question is on Manifold Markets, a platform where users can create and bet on the outcome of various events. The number of traders an event attracts can vary widely based on the event's interest, the platform's user base growth, and external factors like media coverage. - Timeframe: The question specifies the end of July 15 as the deadline. This gives the market roughly 6 weeks from the creation date (May 30) to reach the specified number of traders. - Growth Potential: Manifold Markets has been growing, but the rate of growth and the specific interest in this question can significantly impact the number of traders. Without specific growth metrics or interest indicators, it's challenging to predict with certainty. Given these factors, it's reasonable to assume that reaching 377 traders might be achievable but is not guaranteed. The platform's growth and the specific interest in this market question will play significant roles. Assuming a moderate level of interest and continued platform growth, I would estimate the probability of this condition being met as around 0.6 (60%). (b) ISS advises Tesla shareholders to vote against either Elon Musk's $57 billion package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk: - ISS's Stance on Executive Compensation: ISS has historically been critical of excessive executive compensation packages. Elon Musk's $57 billion package is one of the largest, which might attract negative recommendations from ISS. - Kimbal Musk's Re-election: ISS also evaluates board members' performance and may recommend against re-election if they deem it necessary. However, without specific issues highlighted against Kimbal Musk, predicting this outcome is more challenging. - Precedent and Context: Previous recommendations by ISS on similar matters can provide insight. However, each case is evaluated on its merits, and the outcome can be influenced by various factors, including Tesla's performance, governance practices, and the broader market context. Given ISS's general stance on excessive compensation and assuming no significant positive changes in Tesla's governance or performance that would sway ISS's opinion, the probability of ISS advising against at least one of these as around 0.55 (55%). Combining Probabilities: To find the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening. 0.6 (market reaching 377 traders) * 0.55 (ISS advising against at least one of the specified actions) = 0.33. Reasoning: The estimate combines the individual probabilities of the market reaching a certain number of traders by a specific date and ISS advising against a significant executive compensation package or a board member's re-election. Both probabilities are based on general trends and the specifics of the question, without access to real-time data on the market's growth or ISS's current stance."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04927784837433158, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.016425949458110527, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.38426994054976443, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) Democrats have a brokered convention in 2024: A brokered convention occurs when no candidate secures a majority of delegates during the initial round of voting, leading to multiple rounds of voting. This scenario is more likely when there are multiple strong contenders, and the field is highly divided. Given the current state of the Democratic Party and the lack of a clear, dominant candidate (as of my last update), there's a reasonable chance of a contested convention. However, predicting the exact dynamics of the primary season is challenging, and the field could consolidate around a single candidate, reducing the likelihood of a brokered convention. (b) 10 or more Democratic Senators call for Biden to drop out before July 20: This event is highly dependent on factors such as President Biden's approval ratings, the state of the economy, geopolitical events, and the performance of the Democratic Party in the primary season. If President Biden's popularity plummets or if the party's prospects look dire, more Senators might call for him to step aside. However, as of my last update, there hasn't been a significant wave of Democratic Senators publicly calling for Biden to drop out. The threshold of 10 or more Senators is relatively high, and achieving this before July 20 seems unlikely without a dramatic shift in political circumstances. Combining the probabilities: Given the uncertainties and the specific conditions required for each event, I'll estimate the probabilities as follows: Probability of a brokered convention: 0.25 (reflecting the uncertainty and the need for a highly divided field) Probability of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20: 0.15 (considering the high threshold and the lack of current momentum towards this outcome). Since these events are not entirely independent (a brokered convention could influence Senatorial opinions on Biden's candidacy), but also not directly causally linked, I'll use a conservative approach to estimate the combined probability. Assuming a moderate level of dependence, the combined probability would be lower than the product of the two probabilities but not drastically so. Reasoning: The combined probability of both a brokered convention occurring and 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20 is relatively low, given the specific conditions required for each event and the current political landscape."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0008322009570119332, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0002774003190039777, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.05349812358622226, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Condition (a): At least 24 world records are broken. The number of world records broken can vary greatly from one Olympics to another, depending on factors such as the quality of the athletes, the conditions of the events, and the rules in place. In recent Olympics, the number of world records broken has been relatively low, with 17 records broken in the 2016 Rio Olympics and 27 records broken in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (which were held in 2021 due to the pandemic). Given the trend of increasing athletic performance over time, it's reasonable to assume that the number of world records broken will continue to be around 20-30. Condition (b): France places in the Top 5. France has consistently been a strong performer in the Olympics, often placing in the top 10 in the medal table.

As of the current date (July 4, 2024), Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points in the 538 national polling average.

As of the current date (May 9, 2020), the 2024 presidential election is still over four years away, and polling data is limited. However, we can look at the historical trends of presidential election polls to inform our estimate. In general, presidential election polls tend to be volatile, with candidates' leads fluctuating over time. However, as the election approaches, the polls tend to converge towards the actual outcome. Given the current uncertainty and the historical volatility of presidential election polls, it is difficult to predict with high confidence the exact margin of Trump's lead over Biden on July 15, 2024.

To analyze this question, we need to consider the relationship between the stock market, specifically Nvidia's stock price, and the US Core CPI. Nvidia's stock price is influenced by various factors such as the company's financial performance, industry trends, and overall market conditions. On the other hand, the US Core CPI is a measure of inflation that is influenced by factors such as economic growth, monetary policy, and supply and demand imbalances. There is no direct causal link between Nvidia's stock price and the US Core CPI. However, both can be influenced by broader economic conditions. If Nvidia's stock price falls below $100 per share, it could be an indication of a decline in investor sentiment or a decrease in demand for technology stocks. This could be a sign of a slowing economy, which might lead to lower inflation. However, the relationship is not straightforward, and many other factors can influence the US Core CPI. Given the lack of a direct causal link and the complexity of the relationships involved, it is difficult to make a strong prediction about the US Core CPI based on Nvidia's stock price. Therefore, I will assign a probability that is roughly equivalent to the base rate of the event, which is the probability of the US Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in a given month.

First, let's consider the likelihood of Ted Cruz becoming the Republican nominee. While Cruz has run for president before and has a strong conservative base, the Republican nomination process is inherently unpredictable. However, assuming Cruz does become the nominee, we can move on to the second part of the question. Next, we need to consider the polling dynamics between Trump and Biden. Historically, Trump has been a polarizing figure, and his polling numbers have been relatively stable, with a strong base of support among Republicans. Biden, on the other hand, has had more variable polling numbers, but has generally been competitive with Trump in national polls. Given these dynamics, it's possible that Trump could have a lead over Biden in the polls, but the size of that lead is difficult to predict. 538's national polling average is a weighted average of multiple polls, which can help to smooth out some of the noise in individual polls. However, even with this averaging, polling numbers can still be volatile, especially in the midst of a presidential campaign. Considering these factors, I would estimate that the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, is relatively low.

As of the question's creation date (July 8, 2024), Trump's lead is around 2.4 points.

However, for the sake of this question, we assume this condition is met. Given this condition, we need to consider the potential backlash and increased tensions that could arise from such an event. The issuance of arrest warrants could lead to increased anger and resentment among some groups, potentially inspiring terrorist acts. However, it's essential to note that the connection between the ICC's actions and terrorist acts is not direct or guaranteed. Historically, France has been a target for terrorist attacks, and the 2024 Summer Olympics could be an attractive target for terrorists. The event's high profile, large crowds, and international attention could make it an appealing target for groups seeking to make a statement. However, France has a robust security apparatus, and the country has taken significant measures to prevent and respond to terrorist threats. The Olympics will likely have enhanced security measures in place, making it more challenging for terrorists to carry out an attack.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the current polling trends and the historical variability of polling averages. As of the knowledge cutoff in 2022, the polling averages were not yet available for the 2024 presidential election. However, we can look at the historical trends in polling averages for presidential elections. Typically, polling averages tend to be volatile and can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as debates, scandals, and changes in the political landscape. Given the uncertainty and volatility of polling averages, it's challenging to make a precise prediction about the polling average on a specific date, especially more than a year in advance. However, we can make an educated guess based on the assumption that the polling average will continue to fluctuate within a reasonable range. Assuming a normal distribution of polling averages, we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4) as follows: The probability of Trump's lead being exactly 3 or 4 is relatively low, as the polling average is likely to fluctuate around these values. The probability of Trump's lead being greater than 3 is higher, as the polling average could potentially increase due to various factors. The probability of Trump's lead being less than or equal to 4 is also relatively high, as the polling average could potentially decrease or remain stable. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, to be around 0.15.

(b) Chris Christie being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of my last update, Chris Christie has not been the front-runner in the Republican primary race.

However, we can look at historical trends and the current political climate for guidance. In recent history, incumbent presidents have rarely dropped out of a re-election campaign.

Firstly, it's essential to note that polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as changes in public opinion, polling methodology, and sampling variability. However, 538's national polling average is a well-established and reputable aggregator of polls, which helps to reduce some of this variability. Given the current political climate and the fact that the 2024 presidential election is still over a year away, it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, we can look at historical trends to inform our estimate. In the 2020 presidential election, the polling average margin between Trump and Biden was relatively stable, with Biden leading by around 7-10 points for most of the campaign. Assuming a similar level of stability in the 2024 election, it's unlikely that Trump's lead would suddenly increase to 3-4 points in a short period.

Part (a) - Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024: This event is highly unlikely. The 25th Amendment Section 4 has never been invoked in U.S. history, and it would require a significant and sudden change in President Biden's health or mental capacity. Given that President Biden has been serving as President for over three years without any major issues, it is unlikely that he will be declared incapacitated in the next few months.

Part (b) - Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President: This event is also unlikely. President Biden has shown no indication that he intends to step down or not seek re-election. In fact, he has been actively campaigning and raising funds for his re-election bid. While it's possible that he could change his mind, it would be a significant surprise given his current actions and statements. Combining the probabilities: Given that both events are highly unlikely, the probability of both occurring is extremely low. I would estimate the probability of part (a) occurring at around 0.01 (1%) and the probability of part (b) occurring at around 0.05 (5%).

Nate Silver's Model: Nate Silver's model is a well-regarded forecasting tool in U.S. politics. An increase in Kamala Harris's odds of winning, as predicted by this model, suggests a shift in the electoral landscape that could potentially impact Joe Biden's decision-making. 2. Joe Biden's Decision-Making: The decision to not seek or accept the nomination is a significant one, influenced by various factors including personal health, political climate, party dynamics, and the likelihood of winning. An increase in Kamala Harris's odds might suggest that the party or the electorate is leaning towards a different candidate, which could influence Biden's decision. 3. Timing and Political Strategy: Announcing before July 15, 2024, gives the party and potential candidates time to adjust strategies and prepare for the nomination process. This timing could be crucial for a smooth transition of power within the party. 4. Public Perception and Party Unity: The announcement's timing and the reasoning behind it could significantly impact public perception and party unity. A decision influenced by a shift in electoral odds might be seen as pragmatic, potentially maintaining or even enhancing party unity. Considering these factors, the probability that Joe Biden will announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination, conditional on Kamala Harris's increased odds of winning, seems plausible but not certain.

First, a brokered convention is an unusual event in modern US politics, and it would likely indicate significant divisions within the Democratic Party. In such a scenario, it's plausible that some Democrats might oppose the early nomination of Biden, especially if they feel that the process is being rushed or that Biden's nomination is not sufficiently democratic. However, the Democratic Party has a strong tradition of rallying behind its eventual nominee, and it's possible that many Democrats would be reluctant to publicly oppose the early nomination of Biden, especially if they feel that it would harm the party's chances in the general election. Given these considerations, I would estimate that the probability of at least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early is around 0.3.

However, we can look at historical trends and the current political climate to make an informed prediction. Historically, the Democratic Party has nominated a male candidate in every presidential election since 1984, when Geraldine Ferraro became the first female vice-presidential nominee on a major party ticket. However, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of female candidates running for public office, and the party has made efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. In the 2020 Democratic primary, several women ran for the nomination, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Tulsi Gabbard. While none of them won the nomination, their candidacies helped to pave the way for future female candidates. Looking ahead to 2024, there are several women who could potentially run for the Democratic nomination, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg's former rival Stacey Abrams, and Senator Elizabeth Warren.

While it's possible that Suarez could gain traction and become a viable candidate, it's difficult to assess his chances without more information about his campaign and the Republican Party's dynamics.

Nonetheless, I can provide a general analysis. In the Eurovision Song Contest, each country's qualification chances depend on various factors such as the quality of their song, live performance, and voting patterns. Georgia and Albania have had varying degrees of success in the past, with some years seeing them qualify for the Grand Final and others not. Given the unpredictability of the competition and the lack of specific information about the 2024 contest, I will rely on general trends. Historically, around 50% of participating countries in each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final. Since both Georgia and Albania need to qualify, we can assume their individual probabilities of qualifying are around 50% or slightly lower, considering the competition. However, because the question requires both countries to qualify, we need to consider the probability of both events happening together.

(a) Meta publishes a public report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024: The likelihood of Meta publishing such a report hinges on several factors, including their commitment to transparency, the current regulatory environment, and the progress of their AI safety research. Given the increasing scrutiny of AI safety and the importance of demonstrating responsible AI development practices, it's plausible that Meta would choose to publish a report on the external red-teaming of their models. However, the specificity of the deadline (June 30, 2024) and the requirement for the report to be public introduce some uncertainty. Companies often face challenges in meeting specific deadlines for publishing detailed research findings, especially when it involves external parties. Probability for (a): Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of Meta publishing a public report on the external red-teaming of their models by June 30, 2024, to be around 0.6. This reflects a somewhat optimistic view of Meta's transparency efforts but also acknowledges the challenges in meeting specific deadlines. (b) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, 2024: The success of the market in attracting traders depends on various factors, including the market's visibility, the interest in the question being asked, the ease of use of the platform, and the overall appeal of predictive markets to potential traders. Given the niche nature of the question and the requirement for a significant number of traders (377), this condition might be more challenging to fulfill. However, the market's focus on a topic of growing interest (AI safety) and the presence of a specific, measurable outcome could attract a dedicated group of participants. Probability for (b): Considering these factors, the probability of the market reaching at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, 2024, seems lower than that of Meta publishing the report. I would estimate this probability to be around 0.4, reflecting the challenges in attracting a large number of traders to a specific market, especially within a defined timeframe. Combining Probabilities: To find the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening. Probability of (a) and (b) both occurring = Probability of (a) * Probability of (b) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.

Therefore, I estimate the probability of a group of at least 5 named Democratic Party US House Members or US Senators working together to pressure Biden to drop out before July 20th, conditional on Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat, to be around 0.4."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "eb63fd05-a8f5-4307-9271-aac529ea9826", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Will Trump gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat?

First, let's consider the likelihood of Joe Biden dropping out or being unable to continue the race before July 20 midnight Eastern Time. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at historical trends and current events. As of the creation date of this question (May 3, 2021), Joe Biden has just taken office and has not shown any indication of dropping out or being unable to continue the race. However, the question is asking about the likelihood of this event occurring before July 20, 2024, which is over three years in the future. A lot can happen in three years, and it's possible that Biden's health or political situation could change. However, without any specific information suggesting that Biden is likely to drop out, we should assign a relatively low probability to this event. Second, let's consider the likelihood of Mike Pence being selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. As of the creation date of this question (May 3, 2021), Mike Pence has not announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, and it's unclear whether he will run. However, Pence has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party and has a strong reputation among conservatives. If Biden were to drop out, it's possible that Pence could emerge as a strong candidate for the Republican nomination. However, the Republican primary process is notoriously unpredictable, and there are many other potential candidates who could also run. Given these considerations, we can estimate the probability of Mike Pence being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election if Joe Biden drops out before July 20 midnight Eastern Time. While it's impossible to assign a precise probability, we can use our judgment to estimate the likelihood of these events occurring."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c98f42da-594a-4419-a50d-3d2498832b95", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Biden drops out before July 20 and (b) Mike Pence is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(a) Biden drops out or is otherwise unable to continue the race before July 20 midnight Eastern Time.

To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the qualification of Belgium and Czechia. Firstly, we note that the qualification process for Eurovision is based on a combination of jury and public voting, and the countries that qualify are determined by their overall score. The fact that Belgium has qualified does not directly affect the qualification chances of Czechia, as each country's score is independent of the others. However, we can consider some indirect factors that might influence the qualification chances of Czechia. For example, if Belgium's qualification is due to a strong performance in the semi-final, it's possible that other countries in the same semi-final, including Czechia, might have a lower chance of qualifying due to the increased competition. On the other hand, if Belgium's qualification is due to a strong jury vote, it's possible that other countries with similar jury appeal, including Czechia, might have a higher chance of qualifying. Given these considerations, we can conclude that the qualification of Belgium does not have a direct and significant impact on the qualification chances of Czechia.

As of the question's creation date (April 13, 2024), the polling average might not be available or might be subject to significant changes. However, we can make an educated guess based on general knowledge of election polling dynamics. In general, polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as campaign events, debates, and external factors like economic conditions or global events. Given the time frame between the question's creation date and the resolution date (July 15, 2024), there is ample opportunity for the polling average to change. Assuming that the polling average will continue to fluctuate, we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) as follows: The probability of Trump's lead being exactly within this range is relatively low, as polling averages tend to be volatile and can change rapidly.

Event (a) concerns the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) being higher on July 20, 2024, than it was on July 20, 2023. The VXVCLS measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 Index over the next three months. It is influenced by various market and economic factors, including geopolitical tensions, economic indicators, and investor sentiment. Given the current global economic and geopolitical landscape, it is challenging to predict with certainty whether the VXVCLS will be higher in July 2024 compared to July 2023. However, historical data suggests that the VXVCLS can be volatile and influenced by unforeseen events. Therefore, I will assign a moderate probability to this event. Event (b) involves Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024. The Israel-Iran conflict is a longstanding and complex issue, with both countries having a history of tensions and military actions. While there have been reports of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets in the past, the likelihood of such an event occurring before May 1, 2024, is uncertain. The probability of this event depends on various factors, including the current political climate, military strategies, and diplomatic efforts. Given the unpredictability of geopolitical events, I will assign a relatively low probability to this event. Combining the probabilities of both events, we need to consider that they are not necessarily independent.

However, the season finale is often a highly anticipated and emotionally charged episode, which can lead to higher ratings.\n\nConsidering the overall quality of the show and the fact that the season finale is often a crucial episode, I think it's likely that the episode will receive a high rating. However, the strict inequality (>8.5) makes it a bit more challenging. Based on the current ratings, I'd say that the episode has a good chance of receiving a rating above 8.5, but it's not a guarantee.\n\n(b) M.

Night Shyamalan's recent films have received mixed CinemaScores, with some films receiving high scores (e.g., \"Split\": B+) and others receiving lower scores (e.g., \"Knock at the Cabin\": C). However, the trailer for \"Trap\" has been well-received, which could be a good indicator of the film's quality.\n\nWhile it's difficult to predict CinemaScores with certainty, I think that \"Trap\" has a good chance of receiving a B or above, given Shyamalan's track record and the positive reception of the trailer.\n\nCombined Probability\n\nTo estimate the combined probability of both events occurring, I'll multiply the individual probabilities. Based on my reasoning, I'd estimate the probability of event (a) occurring at around 0.7 (70%) and the probability of event (b) occurring at around 0.6 (60%). Therefore, the combined probability would be:\n\n0.7 (event a) \u00d7 0.6 (event b) = 0.42\n\nReasoning: Both events have a good chance of occurring, but the strict inequality in event (a) and the uncertainty surrounding CinemaScores in event (b) reduce the overall probability.

Given Cheney's public disagreements with Trump, her chances within a party that still largely supports him are diminished. 3. Alternatives and Competition: The Republican field for the 2024 presidential election is expected to be crowded, with several candidates who are more aligned with the current party base than Cheney.

(a) Liz Cheney becoming the Republican nominee: This event is highly uncertain and depends on various factors including her popularity, campaign performance, and the preferences of Republican voters and delegates. As of my last update in early 2023, Liz Cheney's political trajectory, including her loss in the Wyoming Republican primary for her House seat in August 2022, suggests that her path to becoming the Republican nominee is challenging. However, the political landscape can change significantly over time due to various factors. Given the competitive nature of presidential primaries and the unpredictability of political events, I would estimate the probability of Liz Cheney becoming the Republican nominee as relatively low but not impossible. (b) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination: This event also carries significant uncertainty. As of early 2023, Joe Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election, but political landscapes can change due to health issues, political calculus, or other unforeseen events. Given the factors that could influence his decision, including his age, political climate, and the emergence of other strong Democratic candidates, the probability of him announcing he will not accept the nomination is also uncertain but seems relatively low given his stated intentions. Combining these probabilities: Given that both events are relatively unlikely, the probability of both occurring is even lower. The probability of two independent events both happening is the product of their individual probabilities.

First, we need to consider whether Joe Biden's resignation announcement would have a significant impact on the USD/JPY exchange rate. Historically, the resignation of a U.S. President can cause short-term market volatility, but its long-term impact on the exchange rate is often limited. However, in this scenario, the announcement would likely lead to increased uncertainty and potentially weaken the USD in the short term. Next, we need to consider the current USD/JPY exchange rate and the market conditions that might influence it. As of my knowledge cutoff, the USD/JPY exchange rate has been around 140 JPY per USD. Given the current market conditions and trends, it's possible that the exchange rate could reach 145 JPY per USD by August 9th, 2024, even without the resignation announcement.

In fact, he has expressed his intention to run for re-election. However, his age and health have been a concern, and it's possible that he might decide not to run due to health reasons. Second, we should consider the political landscape and the Democratic Party's dynamics. If the party is united behind Biden, it's less likely that he will drop out. However, if there are significant challenges to his candidacy or if the party is divided, it's more likely that he might consider not running. Third, we should consider the timeframe. The question is asking about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention, typically held in August. If Biden decides not to run, it's likely that he will make an announcement before the convention to give the party time to find an alternative candidate.

Event 1: Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President. Reasoning: As of the current date (August 2022), Joe Biden has not explicitly stated that he will not seek re-election. While there have been speculations about his potential retirement, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that he will make such an announcement before July 15, 2024. In fact, Biden has hinted at running for re-election in 2024. Given the lack of clear indications, it's challenging to predict with certainty that he will make this announcement.

Reasoning: Chris Christie has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, but his chances of becoming the nominee are uncertain. The Republican primary field is expected to be crowded, with several other notable candidates, such as Donald Trump, potentially running. While Christie has a strong reputation and experience, it's difficult to predict with confidence that he will emerge as the nominee.

The two events are largely independent, and the investigation in Georgia will likely proceed based on its own merits, regardless of Biden's political decisions.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the relationship between the two events. First, let's examine the condition: Joe Biden having an in-person interview for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024. This event is unrelated to the process of removing or blocking Donald Trump from the primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment's Section 3, also known as the Disqualification Clause, states that individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort to its enemies, are ineligible to hold federal office. The process of removing or blocking someone from the ballot under this clause involves legal proceedings, court decisions, and state government actions, which are independent of Joe Biden's interview schedule. Given the lack of a direct causal link between the two events, it's reasonable to assume that the occurrence of one event does not significantly influence the probability of the other. Therefore, the probability of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is largely independent of Joe Biden's interview. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the probability of Trump being removed or blocked is not zero. There are ongoing efforts to challenge Trump's eligibility under Section 3, and court decisions or state government actions could potentially lead to his removal or blocking from the ballot. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, conditional on Joe Biden having an in-person interview for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024, to be relatively low, but not negligible."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "052ba33a-82d7-4398-a742-32ca599c5e23", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Joe Biden have an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024, and (2) Donald Trump be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?", "body": "(1) Joe Biden must appear in an in-person interview for at least 45 minutes, excluding press conferences, speeches, rallies, fundraisers, town halls, etc. The interview must be released before the end of July 2024.

Joe Biden having an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024: Given the nature of political life and the media landscape, it's common for high-profile figures like the President to engage in lengthy interviews, especially during significant political periods. The requirement for the interview to be at least 45 minutes long and in-person narrows the scope but still leaves room for various formats such as podcasts, late-night shows, or in-depth news programs. Considering the timeframe (before the end of July 2024) and the typical media engagement of a President, especially in an election year, the likelihood of this event seems relatively high. 2. Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as of July 15, 2024: This part of the question involves a more specific and less common event. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, known as the Disqualification Clause, allows for the disqualification of individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The application of this clause to remove or block a candidate like Donald Trump would be unprecedented in modern times and would likely involve significant legal and political hurdles. The clause's application would depend on specific actions taken by Trump that could be legally defined as insurrection or rebellion, and the willingness of state or federal authorities to invoke this clause. Given the unprecedented nature of this action and the political and legal complexities involved, the likelihood of this event seems lower compared to the first part of the question. Combining the Probabilities: To estimate the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening. If we estimate the first event (Joe Biden having a 45+ minute in-person interview) at 70% and the second event (Donald Trump being removed/block from the primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment) at 20%, the combined probability would be 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14, or 14%. Reasoning: The first condition is fairly common in political life, especially for a president in an election year. The second condition is rare and involves significant legal and political hurdles. Given these considerations, the combined probability is relatively low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.058830315252505594, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.019610105084168532, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3333333333333333, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, without specific information about the entries, their perceived quality, or how voting might go, we can't accurately adjust this probability up or down for Georgia based on Iceland's qualification. Therefore, the probability should reflect a general uncertainty, slightly above a random chance due to potential bloc voting or other factors that might slightly increase the correlation between countries' chances, but not significantly so."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "6b7bd554-7b40-4322-b5d0-e7e66fa6767d", "title": "Will both Iceland and Georgia qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Iceland participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, and (2) Georgia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.
