This competition could split the vote and make it challenging for any single candidate to secure the nomination. 5.

First, let's consider the probability of Joe Biden dying before July 26th. According to publicly available data, Joe Biden was born on November 20, 1942, making him 81 years old as of July 2024. While it's difficult to predict individual mortality, we can look at actuarial tables to estimate the probability of death for someone of his age. According to the Social Security Administration's Actuarial Life Table, the probability of a male dying between the ages of 81 and 82 is approximately 6.5%. However, this is a rough estimate and doesn't take into account individual health factors. Second, let's consider the probability of Joe Biden resigning or otherwise ceasing to be US President before the end of July 2024. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at historical precedents. Since World War II, there have been two instances of a US President resigning (Richard Nixon in 1974 and John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963, which led to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson taking office). Given the relatively low frequency of such events, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of Joe Biden resigning or otherwise ceasing to be US President is low. Considering both components, I estimate the probability of the question resolving YES as follows: Probability: 0.08. This estimate reflects a relatively low probability of Joe Biden dying before July 26th (around 6.5%) and an even lower probability of him resigning or otherwise ceasing to be US President (around 1-2%). The combined probability is roughly the sum of these two probabilities, assuming they are independent events."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 1.4260587280761754, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.47535290935872515, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 2.489782560589819, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This section, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The clause has been rarely invoked and its application to modern politics, especially in the context of Trump's actions, is unprecedented and legally contentious. 2.

Considering these factors, while there is a possibility that legal challenges could lead to Trump being removed or blocked from a state's primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the lack of precedent, the contentious nature of the clause's application, and the required legal and political processes make this outcome less likely."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6fd4477a-68e3-49d9-91ba-961e8ab04214", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Firstly, the removal of Donald Trump from any primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that no person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath to support the Constitution, has engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. The application of this clause to Donald Trump would depend on specific legal interpretations and actions by state governments or courts. Given the polarized political climate and the legal complexities involved, it's difficult to predict with certainty, but it seems unlikely that Trump would be removed from all state ballots by July 15, 2024, due to the time required for legal proceedings and the variability in state election laws. Secondly, the possibility of Ted Cruz being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Ted Cruz has been an active figure in Republican politics and has run for the presidency before. However, the nomination process involves a complex interplay of factors, including the preferences of delegates to the Republican National Convention, primary election outcomes, and the strategies of other candidates.

Current Political Standing: As of my knowledge cutoff, Ron DeSantis is the Governor of Florida, a crucial swing state in US presidential elections. He has gained national attention for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his stance on various policy issues. His popularity among Republicans and his ability to win a swing state make him a viable candidate. 2. Republican Party Dynamics: The Republican Party is currently undergoing a transition, with the influence of former President Donald Trump still significant. DeSantis has been mentioned as a potential heir to Trump's populist and conservative ideology. However, this also means he may face competition from other Trump-aligned candidates or even Trump himself, if he decides to run. 3. Potential Competition: The Republican primary field for 2024 is expected to be crowded, with several candidates already expressing interest or rumored to be considering a run. This includes established politicians like Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, and Ted Cruz, as well as newcomers like Vivek Ramaswamy. DeSantis will need to navigate this competitive landscape to secure the nomination. 4. Electability: DeSantis's electability in a general election is a crucial factor. He has shown appeal to independents and moderate voters in Florida, which could be beneficial in a national election. However, his hardline stances on certain issues might alienate some voters in a general election. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Ron DeSantis being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election as follows: Probability: 0.25.

Both Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis have been mentioned in discussions about possible candidates, but the field is not yet set, and other candidates may still enter the race. 2. Popularity and Recognition: Both Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis have a level of national recognition that could be beneficial in a presidential race. Ted Cruz has run for president before, which gives him some level of experience in a national campaign. Ron DeSantis has gained popularity among conservatives for his policies as Governor of Florida. 3. Competition: The Republican field for the 2024 nomination is expected to be crowded, with several other candidates potentially running. This competition could split the vote in unpredictable ways, making it harder to forecast the outcome. 4. Uncertainty: Given the time frame until the 2024 election, there is significant uncertainty. Factors such as economic conditions, international events, and unforeseen scandals can greatly influence voter preferences and the viability of candidates. 5. Historical Context: Historically, the Republican Party has sometimes nominated candidates who were not the initial frontrunners, showing that the nomination process can be unpredictable. Considering these points, while both Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis are plausible candidates with significant support, the uncertainty of the political landscape, the potential for other strong candidates to emerge, and the unpredictable nature of primary elections make it challenging to assign a very high probability to either of them securing the nomination. However, given their current profiles and the fact that they are among the names frequently mentioned, it seems reasonable to consider them among the more likely candidates compared to the broad field of potential nominees.

Deterrence and Escalation: The decision to carry out a deadly attack within Iran would depend on Israel's assessment of the potential benefits versus the risks of escalation. Iran has threatened severe retaliation for any attack on its soil. 4. International Pressure and Diplomacy: The international community's stance, including that of the United States, European powers, and other regional actors, could influence Israel's decision-making. Diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions or address grievances through negotiation could reduce the likelihood of an attack. 5. Time Frame: The question specifies a relatively short time frame (from April 13, 2024, to May 1, 2024), which might limit the window for such an operation, especially considering the need for planning, intelligence gathering, and strategic decision-making.

In April 2023, he officially launched his re-election campaign, which suggests that he is committed to seeking the Democratic nomination. Second, while it's possible that Biden's plans could change due to unforeseen circumstances, such as health issues or a significant shift in political landscape, there is currently no credible evidence to suggest that he is reconsidering his decision to run. Third, the Democratic Party has a strong incentive to maintain a unified front behind their incumbent president, especially given the historical advantage that incumbent presidents have in re-election campaigns. It's unlikely that the party would encourage or support Biden's withdrawal from the nomination process.

The first part deals with whether Russia will have control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, as indicated by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map. The second part concerns whether Joe Biden will announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President. Given the current geopolitical climate and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether Russia will control Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024. However, considering the dynamic nature of the conflict and the fact that control of specific locations can change frequently, I would estimate the probability of Russia controlling Chasiv Yar on the specified date as relatively low, around 0.3. Regarding the second part of the question, Joe Biden's announcement about not accepting the Democratic nomination, it's also difficult to predict with certainty. However, considering Biden's current stance and the fact that he has not made any definitive statements about not seeking re-election, I would estimate the probability of him making such an announcement before July 15, 2024, as relatively low, around 0.2. Since the question resolves as YES if either of the conditions is met, I need to consider the probability of at least one of the events occurring. Assuming independence between the two events, the probability of at least one of them occurring is 1 minus the probability of neither occurring.

For event (a), Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new figure in the Republican Party, and while he has gained some attention, he is still a long shot to become the nominee. The Republican Party has a history of favoring more established candidates, and Ramaswamy will likely face stiff competition from other candidates. However, it's difficult to predict with certainty, and there is always a chance that he could gain momentum and win the nomination. For event (b), Rishi Sunak is the current Prime Minister of the UK, and while his popularity has waxed and waned, he is still a well-established figure in British politics. The UK's general election system is also designed to favor established parties, and Sunak's Conservative Party has a strong presence in his constituency. However, there is always a chance that he could lose his seat due to various factors such as a strong opponent, local issues, or a national swing against the Conservatives. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as relatively low, around 0.1-0.2. For event (b), I would estimate the probability of Sunak failing to be elected as slightly higher, around 0.2-0.3. However, since the question asks for the probability of either event occurring, we need to combine these probabilities. Using the formula for the probability of either event A or event B occurring, which is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), we can estimate the probability of either event occurring. Assuming that the events are independent, we can ignore the P(A and B) term.

Since World War II, there have been two instances of presidents leaving office prematurely: Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974 and John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963. Current Health and Age: As of my last update in early 2023, President Biden is in his 80s. While age can increase health risks, many individuals remain healthy and active well into their 80s. The public perception of Biden's health has been a topic of discussion, but without specific, credible information indicating severe health issues that would necessitate his stepping down, it's reasonable to assume he will remain in office. Political Climate: The political climate can influence a president's decision to step down, but as of early 2023, there are no clear indications that President Biden is under significant pressure to resign. The political opposition, while vocal, does not appear to have the leverage or the grounds to force a resignation. Personal and Party Considerations: President Biden has not indicated any intention to step down early. Typically, presidents aim to serve their full term unless extraordinary circumstances arise. The Democratic Party also has an interest in maintaining stability and continuity, especially in the absence of a clear, universally accepted successor.

The second condition is that Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024.

FiveThirtyEight's forecasts can fluctuate significantly based on various factors, including polling data, economic indicators, and campaign events. Given the dynamic nature of these forecasts, it's plausible that Biden could be projected as the favorite on July 19, 2024, especially if positive trends for him continue or if there are significant events that impact Trump's chances. However, without specific data or insights into future events, this part of the question is inherently uncertain. The second part of the question pertains to Kamala Harris' choice for running mate, specifically whether she will choose Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro before August 7th. As of my last update, I do not have real-time information on Kamala Harris' intentions or the latest political developments. However, both Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are plausible candidates for the VP slot given their political profiles and the strategic considerations that typically influence such decisions. Without specific information on Harris' preferences or the political calculus at play, it's challenging to assess the likelihood of this part resolving to YES. However, it's worth noting that the VP pick is a significant decision that often involves careful consideration of various factors, including political balance, appeal to different voter demographics, and personal compatibility. Given the uncertainty and the lack of specific data for both parts of the question, I will provide a probability estimate that reflects the plausible but uncertain nature of these events."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.049270947102782015, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.016423649034260673, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.31583322092743277, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historically, both countries have had varying degrees of success in the competition. Latvia has qualified for the Grand Final 10 times out of 24 attempts, while Australia has qualified 7 times out of 9 attempts since its debut in 2015. However, past performance is not always indicative of future success. The Eurovision Song Contest is known for its unpredictability, and many factors can influence a country's chances of qualifying, such as the quality of the song, the performance, and the competition in the semi-finals. Given the lack of information about the specific songs and performances for Eurovision 2024, we can only rely on general trends and historical data. Assuming that both countries will participate in the semi-finals, we can estimate their chances of qualifying based on their past performance. Latvia's qualification rate is around 41.7% (10/24), while Australia's qualification rate is around 77.8% (7/9). Since the question asks if either country will qualify, we can calculate the probability of at least one of them qualifying. Let's assume that the qualification chances for both countries are independent of each other. We can calculate the probability of neither country qualifying and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least one country qualifying. The probability of Latvia not qualifying is 1 - 0.417 = 0.583. The probability of Australia not qualifying is 1 - 0.778 = 0.222.

Condition (a) depends on Sha'Carri Richardson's performance in the 2024 Paris Olympics. As of my knowledge cutoff, Richardson is a talented American sprinter who has shown impressive results in the 100m and 200m events. However, predicting an individual athlete's performance in a specific event two years in advance is challenging due to various factors such as injuries, training, and competition. Assuming Richardson remains healthy and continues to perform at a high level, her chances of winning a gold medal in either the 100m or 4x100m relay events are difficult to quantify but likely lower than 50%. Condition (b) depends on France's overall performance in the 2024 Paris Olympics. As the host country, France might have an advantage in terms of familiarity with the venues and crowd support. However, predicting a country's overall medal count is also challenging due to the numerous events and variables involved. Historically, France has been a strong performer in the Olympics, often ranking among the top 10 in the medal table. Given the home advantage, it's reasonable to assume France has a higher chance of placing in the top 5, but the exact probability is still uncertain. To combine these probabilities, we can use a rough estimate of the probability of either event occurring. Assuming Richardson's chances of winning a gold medal are around 30% (a generous estimate considering the competition), and France's chances of placing in the top 5 are around 60% (given their historical performance and home advantage), we can use the formula for the probability of either event A or event B occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since the events are not mutually exclusive (Richardson's performance does not directly affect France's overall medal count), we can assume P(A and B) is relatively low, around 10%.

Although anything can happen in politics, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that Biden will drop out before July 20. Event (b) is more plausible. Kamala Harris is a potential presidential candidate, and Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are both viable options for a running mate. Mark Kelly is a U.S. Senator from Arizona and has a strong background in politics and the military. Josh Shapiro is the Attorney General of Pennsylvania and has gained national attention for his efforts in protecting voting rights.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also introduced uncertainties in electoral trends, with some groups potentially benefiting from the crisis management and others losing support. 3. Coalition Dynamics: The formation of coalitions and alliances within the European Parliament can significantly affect the distribution of seats and influence. GUE/NGL might need to form coalitions to achieve a majority, which can be unpredictable. 4. Voter Turnout and Engagement: Voter turnout in European elections has historically been lower than in national elections, which can introduce unpredictability, especially if certain demographics or regions show higher turnout than expected.

Let's hypothetically consider this around 0.3 (30%) for the sake of argument, though this is a very rough estimate. For part (b), predicting currency movements is highly speculative without current data. However, significant movements are possible, and hitting a specific threshold can be considered plausible.

The probability that at least one of these occurs can be estimated by considering the complement of neither occurring. If we assume independence (which might not fully hold due to potential correlations in economic and political sentiment), the probability of neither occurring would be (1-0.3)*(1-0.4) = 0.7*0.6 = 0.42.

Historically, geomagnetic storms with Kp indices greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 are relatively rare, but not uncommon. According to data from the German Research Center for Geosciences, which is the source of the data for this question, the frequency of geomagnetic storms with Kp indices in this range varies from year to year, but on average, about 10-20% of all geomagnetic storms have Kp indices in this range. However, it's also important to consider the time of year and the current solar cycle. Geomagnetic storms are more frequent and intense during periods of high solar activity, such as during solar maximum. The current solar cycle (Solar Cycle 25) is expected to peak in 2025, so we are currently in a period of increasing solar activity. Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of the strongest geomagnetic storm having a K-index ('Kp') greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 between July 17 and July 28, 2024, is around 0.25.

For event (a), the probability of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, is difficult to estimate due to the complexity of geopolitical tensions and the unpredictability of military actions. However, we can consider the historical context and current relations between Israel and Iran. There have been tensions and conflicts between the two countries in the past, but a large-scale attack resulting in at least five deaths is a significant event.

For event (b), the probability of Joe Biden dropping out before the end of the National Democratic Convention is also uncertain.

In general, public opinion polls have shown that Joe Biden tends to perform worse than other Democrats when pitted against Trump. This suggests that some voters might be more willing to vote for a generic Democrat than for Biden specifically. However, it's unclear whether this trend will hold true among Manifold respondents. The provided polls on Manifold show Trump consistently losing to both Biden and the generic Democrat.

First, let's examine the market's current state. Unfortunately, the provided text does not include real-time data on the current number of traders or the market's growth rate. However, we can make some educated guesses based on general trends in prediction markets. Typically, prediction markets experience an initial surge in participation when they are first created, followed by a slower growth rate over time. Given that this market was created on February 18, 2021, it's likely that the initial surge has already occurred. To reach 377 traders by July 15, the market would need to attract an additional 78 traders (assuming the current number of traders is 299, as mentioned in the prompt). This represents a significant increase in a relatively short period. Considering the time remaining until the deadline (approximately 6 months), it's possible that the market could experience a few spikes in participation, especially if the topic gains more attention or if the market is promoted through social media or other channels. However, without more information on the market's current growth rate or any external factors that might influence participation, it's challenging to make a precise estimate.

The clause has been invoked in the context of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, with some arguing that Trump's actions or inactions on that day could be considered an insurrection. However, the application of Section 3 is complex and involves legal interpretations and political processes. For Trump to be removed or blocked from a primary election ballot under this clause, a state would need to take official action, which could involve court decisions, legal documentation, or official state government announcements. Given the legal and political hurdles, the likelihood of such an action being taken and finalized by July 15, 2024, seems low. Moreover, the political landscape and legal challenges surrounding Trump's candidacy are highly contentious and subject to change.

(a) The probability of a reliable media outlet covering Joe Biden dropping out at least 6 hours in advance depends on several factors, including the likelihood of Biden dropping out and the media's ability to obtain and verify the information in advance. Given the current political climate and Biden's current position as the incumbent president, it seems unlikely that he would drop out of the race. However, if he were to drop out, it's possible that a reliable media outlet could obtain the information in advance. Assuming a low probability of Biden dropping out (around 10%), and a moderate probability of a reliable media outlet covering it in advance (around 30% given the drop out), the combined probability of this event is approximately 0.1 x 0.3 = 0.03. (b) The probability of Donald Trump Jr. being selected as the Republican nominee is difficult to estimate, as it depends on various factors such as the primary elections, delegate votes, and party dynamics.

Assuming a moderate probability of Donald Trump Jr. gaining significant support (around 20%), and a low to moderate probability of him being selected as the nominee (around 10-20%), the combined probability of this event is approximately 0.2 x 0.15 = 0.03.

Historical Performance of Kalenjin Athletes: The Kalenjin people, from western Kenya, have a remarkable record in long-distance running, especially in marathons. They have produced some of the world's most successful distance runners, including multiple Olympic and World Championship winners. 2. Genetic and Environmental Factors: Research suggests that both genetic predispositions and environmental factors, such as high-altitude training, contribute to the success of Kalenjin runners. Their bodies are often more efficient at using oxygen, which is advantageous in endurance events. 3. Current Competitive Landscape: As of my last update, Kalenjin athletes continue to dominate the top ranks of marathon running. This dominance is evident in both men's and women's categories in major international competitions. 4. Olympic Competition: The Olympics are the pinnacle of athletic competition, attracting the best of the best from around the globe. While dominance in one event or category does not guarantee future success, the consistent performance of Kalenjin athletes in marathons suggests a strong likelihood of continued success. 5. Specific Prediction for 2024 Paris Olympics: Given the historical and current trends, it's reasonable to infer that Kalenjin athletes will be strong contenders in both the men's and women's marathon races at the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, predicting with certainty that they will win both races involves considering the unpredictability of individual performances, injuries, and the emergence of new talent from other regions. Considering these points, while it's likely that Kalenjin athletes will perform well, the specific outcome of both races is subject to numerous variables.

Let's assign a relatively low probability to this event, say 0.2, reflecting the uncertainty and lack of concrete evidence.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding public office.

However, this doesn't necessarily mean it can't happen again. 2. Current political landscape: The Democratic Party has a large field of potential candidates, which increases the likelihood of a brokered convention. However, the party has also implemented rules changes aimed at reducing the chances of a brokered convention. 3. Delegate allocation: The Democratic Party's proportional allocation of delegates makes it more difficult for a candidate to win a majority on the first ballot. However, this also means that candidates are more likely to drop out before the convention, reducing the number of contenders. 4. Candidate dynamics: The dynamics between candidates can play a significant role. If multiple candidates have a significant number of delegates, but no one has a majority, a brokered convention becomes more likely. 5. Party unity: The Democratic Party has been working to promote unity and avoid a brokered convention. Superdelegates, who were previously able to vote on the first ballot, are now required to vote on the second ballot, reducing their influence. Considering these factors, while there are valid arguments on both sides, the large field of candidates and the proportional allocation of delegates increase the likelihood of a brokered convention.

Secondly, advances in sports technology, training methods, and athlete preparation have been steadily improving over the years, enabling athletes to push the boundaries of human performance. This trend is likely to continue, contributing to a higher probability of record-breaking achievements. Thirdly, the Paris Olympics will feature new events and disciplines, such as surfing, skateboarding, and sport climbing, which may have a higher potential for record-breaking performances due to their novelty and the relative lack of established benchmarks. However, it's also important to consider that world records are becoming increasingly difficult to break, as athletes are already performing at extremely high levels. Additionally, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Federations (IFs) have implemented various measures to ensure fair play and prevent doping, which may reduce the likelihood of extraordinary performances. Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of at least 24 world records being broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics is around 0.6.

(a) At least 24 world records are broken: The number of world records broken at the Olympics can vary greatly from one edition to another, depending on factors such as the quality of the athletes, the conditions of the tracks and pools, and the introduction of new technologies or techniques. However, looking at past trends, it's not uncommon for around 20-30 world records to be broken at each Olympics. Given the continuous improvement in athletic performance and technology, it's plausible that at least 24 world records could be broken in 2024. (b) France places in the Top 5: France has historically been a strong performer at the Olympics, often placing in the top 10 in the medal table. However, placing in the top 5 is a more challenging task, as it requires a significant number of medals, particularly gold medals. While France has the potential to perform well, especially as the host country, which often experiences a boost in performance, the competition at the top of the medal table is fierce. The United States, China, Great Britain, and other powerhouses consistently vie for the top spots, making it difficult for France to break into the top 5. Considering both components, the probability of at least one of them occurring is higher than the probability of either one occurring individually, due to the principle of inclusion-exclusion in probability theory. This principle states that for two events A and B, the probability of A or B occurring is the sum of the probabilities of A and B occurring minus the probability of both A and B occurring. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of at least 24 world records being broken as 0.6 and the probability of France placing in the top 5 as 0.4. However, the probability of both events occurring is likely lower, around 0.2, due to the different factors influencing each event.

As of the question's creation date (July 4, 2024), Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points in the 538 national polling average. However, it's essential to note that polling numbers can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, campaign events, and polling methodology. Given the current lead of 2.4 points, it's reasonable to assume that Trump's lead might increase or decrease in the following weeks.

Considering the historical volatility of presidential election polls, it's possible that Trump's lead might remain within the range of 2-4 points.

For event (a), we need to consider the current polling trends and the historical volatility of presidential election polls. As of the question's creation date (July 4, 2024), the 538 national polling average shows a tight race between Trump and Biden.

As of the creation date of this question (May 9, 2020), the election is still over four years away, and it is difficult to predict with certainty how the political landscape will evolve. However, I can look at the current trends and patterns in polling data. Second, I will examine the current polling data available.

However, I can look at the polling data from the 2020 presidential election to get an idea of the typical range of polling margins. Third, I will consider the uncertainty associated with polling data. Polling data is subject to various sources of error, including sampling error, non-response bias, and other methodological limitations. This uncertainty can result in fluctuations in polling margins over time. Fourth, I will consider the specific criteria for resolving this question.

For event (a), we need to consider the historical volatility of polling averages and the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 presidential election. While it's difficult to predict the exact polling average on a specific date, we can look at the current trends and the typical margin of error in polling averages. Assuming a normal distribution of polling averages, we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range. For event (b), we need to consider the current political landscape and the likelihood of a Trump family member becoming the Republican nominee. While it's possible that a Trump family member could become the nominee, it's not a guarantee, and other candidates may emerge as strong contenders. Given the uncertainty surrounding both events, I'll assign a moderate probability to each event. For event (a), I estimate the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range as 0.2, considering the historical volatility of polling averages and the uncertainty surrounding the election. For event (b), I estimate the probability of a Trump family member becoming the nominee as 0.3, considering the current political landscape and the possibility of other strong contenders emerging. Since the question asks for the probability of either event occurring, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Assuming independence between the two events, we can estimate P(A \u2229 B) as 0.06 (0.2 x 0.3).

Given the uncertainty and volatility of the conflict, it is challenging to predict with certainty the control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024.

Current trends: If the current trends in the conflict continue, with Ukrainian forces making gradual gains and Russian forces maintaining control over certain areas, it is possible that Chasiv Yar might remain under Russian control. 2. Ukrainian counteroffensives: If Ukrainian forces launch successful counteroffensives in the region, they might be able to retake control of Chasiv Yar, which would resolve the question as NO. 3. Russian military capabilities: Russia has significant military capabilities, and if they choose to focus on maintaining control over Chasiv Yar, they might be able to do so, resolving the question as YES. 4. External factors: The conflict in Ukraine is influenced by various external factors, including international diplomacy, economic sanctions, and military aid. Changes in these factors could impact the dynamics of the conflict and the control of Chasiv Yar. Considering these factors, it is difficult to assign a high probability to either outcome.

This section of the amendment, also known as the Disqualification Clause, prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. To assess the likelihood of this event, we must consider several factors: 1. Legal Basis: The legal basis for such a removal would be Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This clause has been used historically to bar individuals who have supported insurrections against the United States from holding public office. However, its application to a former President, especially in the context of modern political discourse, would be unprecedented and likely contentious. 2. Political Climate: The political climate in the United States is highly polarized. Actions taken against a figure as divisive as Donald Trump would likely face significant political pushback, legal challenges, and public scrutiny. 3. Legal Challenges and Appeals: Any attempt to remove Trump from a ballot under Section 3 would likely face immediate legal challenges. The process of litigation could extend beyond the July 15, 2024, deadline, potentially affecting the resolution of this question. 4. State-Level Actions: The question's resolution depends on actions taken at the state level. Different states have different political leanings and legal frameworks, which could influence whether and how Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is applied. Given these considerations, the probability of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, seems relatively low.

Since the question asks for the probability of either event (a) or event (b) occurring, we need to consider the combined probability of both events. Assuming independence between the two events, we can estimate the combined probability as follows: Combined probability = Probability of event (a) + Probability of event (b) - (Probability of event (a) \u00d7 Probability of event (b)). Using the estimated probabilities above, we get: Combined probability \u2248 0.25 + 0.15 - (0.25 \u00d7 0.15) \u2248 0.3625.

Historical trends: In the 2020 presidential election, the polling average margin between Biden and Trump was relatively stable, with Biden leading by around 7-10 points throughout the summer of 2020. However, the margin narrowed significantly in the final weeks leading up to the election. 2. Current polling averages: As of August 2022, Biden is leading Trump by a smaller margin compared to the 2020 election. This could indicate a more competitive election, which might lead to a narrower margin between the two candidates. 3. Volatility: Polling averages can fluctuate due to various factors, and a 3-4 point lead is a relatively narrow margin. It's possible that the margin could widen or narrow significantly between now and July 15, 2024. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, is relatively low. This is because the polling average margin is likely to fluctuate, and a 3-4 point lead is a narrow margin that might not be sustained."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "3a2a8458-5b27-4fe4-a42f-055e35492eae", "title": "Will Chris Christie be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Chris Christie is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Historically, this provision has only been invoked a handful of times, and usually in situations where the President is physically or mentally unable to perform their duties.

First, let's examine condition (a): the 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee being a woman. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, we can look at historical trends and current political landscape. In the 2020 Democratic primary, several women ran for the nomination, and some, like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, were strong contenders. However, the eventual nominee was a man, Joe Biden. Looking ahead to 2024, there are already several women who have announced their candidacy or are rumored to be considering a run, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Stacey Abrams. Given the increasing number of women in politics and the diversity of the Democratic Party, I'd estimate the probability of a woman winning the nomination at around 0.4. Now, let's consider condition (b): the same nation winning more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics. In recent Olympics, the United States has been a dominant force in women's team sports, winning multiple gold medals in sports like basketball, soccer, and volleyball. Other countries, like China and Australia, have also had success in multiple women's team sports. Given the number of strong teams and the competitive nature of the Olympics, I'd estimate the probability of the same nation winning more than one women's team sport at around 0.6.

To answer this question, we need to consider the likelihood of Trump testifying based on the available information. Firstly, it's worth noting that the trial is scheduled to take place in June 2024, which is still several months away. This gives Trump and his legal team ample time to prepare and potentially negotiate a plea deal or other arrangements that might avoid the need for him to testify. Secondly, Trump has a history of being reluctant to testify under oath, particularly in high-profile cases. In the past, he has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination on multiple occasions, including during the investigation into his business dealings and during the impeachment inquiry. Thirdly, the stakes are high in this trial, with Trump facing potential criminal charges related to the hush money payments. Given the seriousness of the allegations, it's likely that Trump's legal team will advise him to avoid testifying, as it could potentially incriminate him further. Lastly, it's worth considering the potential political implications of Trump testifying. As a former President, Trump is still a high-profile figure, and his testimony could have significant political repercussions. It's possible that he may choose not to testify in order to avoid drawing further attention to himself and his legal troubles.

To estimate the probability of this question resolving YES, we need to consider the likelihood of each event occurring separately and then combine them. Event (1): Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial. Given the ongoing legal proceedings and the fact that Trump has already been involved in various legal battles, it's possible that he may be called to testify. However, without more information about the trial's progress and Trump's involvement, it's difficult to assign a high probability to this event. Event (2): Iran initiating a military action on Israeli territory before August 13, 2024. The Middle East is a volatile region, and tensions between Iran and Israel have been high in the past. However, predicting military actions is inherently uncertain, and there are many factors that could influence Iran's decision-making. Without more specific information about current tensions or events that might trigger such an action, it's challenging to assign a high probability to this event. Considering both events, it's essential to note that they are independent, and the occurrence of one does not directly affect the probability of the other. Therefore, we can estimate the probability of at least one event occurring by calculating the probability of neither event occurring and subtracting that from 1. Given the uncertainty surrounding both events, I will assign a relatively low probability to each event occurring. Let's assume the probability of Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial is around 0.2 (20%), and the probability of Iran initiating a military action on Israeli territory before August 13, 2024, is around 0.1 (10%). To calculate the probability of at least one event occurring, we can use the formula: P(A or B) = 1 - P(not A and not B). Assuming independence, P(not A and not B) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)). P(not A and not B) = (1 - 0.2) * (1 - 0.1) = 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72 P(A or B) = 1 - P(not A and not B) = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, we can look at the historical trends of polling averages in previous presidential elections. Typically, polling averages tend to converge towards the actual election results as the election date approaches. 2. Current polling data: As of the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), the 538 national polling average shows Trump leading Biden by 2.4 points. This is just one data point, but it gives us a rough idea of the current state of the race. 3. Polling average volatility: The 538 national polling average is a weighted average of multiple polls, which helps to reduce volatility. However, polling averages can still fluctuate due to various factors such as changes in polling methodology, sampling errors, and shifts in public opinion. 4. Timeframe: The question is asking about the polling average on July 15, 2024, which is about 6 days after the question's creation date. This is a relatively short timeframe, and significant changes in the polling average are possible but not guaranteed. Considering these factors, I'll make an educated estimate of the probability. Since the current polling average shows Trump leading by 2.4 points, it's reasonable to assume that his lead might fluctuate within a range of 2-4 points over the next 6 days.

Event (a) refers to the ID political group holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliament elections. The ID (Identity and Democracy) group is a right-wing, populist faction in the European Parliament. While it has gained popularity in recent years, it is still a relatively smaller faction compared to the European People's Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), and the Renew Europe group. However, the European Parliament's composition can be unpredictable, and various factors like voter turnout, country-specific politics, and coalition-building can influence the outcome. Without current polling data or more specific information, it's challenging to provide a precise estimate. However, considering the ID group's current size and the competitive nature of European politics, I would rate this event as having a relatively low to moderate probability. Event (b) concerns the approval of the Pandemic Agreement at the May 2024 World Health Assembly (WHA). The Pandemic Agreement aims to strengthen global health governance and preparedness for future pandemics. Given the global impact of COVID-19 and the widespread recognition of the need for improved international cooperation on health issues, there seems to be a strong momentum behind the agreement.

If there were significant health concerns or if his age became a substantial political liability, this could alter his decision. 3. Political Climate and Party Support: The political climate, including factors like approval ratings, party support, and the emergence of strong contenders within the Democratic Party, could influence Biden's decision. Strong opposition from within the party or a significant decline in approval ratings might prompt a decision not to seek re-election. 4. Timing: The deadline of July 15, 2024, is relatively close to the typical time frame when presidential campaigns gain momentum.

While there may be individual Democrats who express their desire for Biden to drop out, the requirement that at least 5 named individuals work together to do so makes it a more challenging task. Additionally, the market's criteria require that the names of the individuals be made public, which adds an extra layer of difficulty. It is possible that some Democrats may be hesitant to publicly criticize Biden or may prefer to work behind the scenes, which could reduce the likelihood of a group of at least 5 named individuals working together to pressure him to drop out."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "6e66a98a-ebef-40e7-b976-ca3f59740714", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Trump gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat, or (b) a group of at least 5 named Dem House Members or US Senators pressure Biden to drop out before July 20th?", "body": "(a) There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6.

To answer this question, we need to consider the current polling trends and the historical volatility of presidential election polls. As of the question's creation date (June 1, 2024), the polling average on 538 shows Trump leading Biden by around 2-3 points. However, it's essential to note that polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, new developments in the campaign, and differences in polling methodologies. Given the current polling trend and the historical volatility of presidential election polls, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether Trump's lead will remain within the specified range on July 15, 2024. However, considering the relatively short timeframe between the question's creation date and the resolution date, it's reasonable to assume that the polling average might not change drastically. Assuming a normal distribution of polling averages, with a mean around the current value (2-3 points) and a standard deviation of around 1-2 points (based on historical data), we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024. Using a normal distribution calculator or software, we can calculate the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range. Let's assume a mean of 2.5 (midpoint of the current range) and a standard deviation of 1.5 (a reasonable estimate based on historical data). The probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 can be calculated as follows: P(2 < Trump's lead \u2264 3) = P(2 < X \u2264 3), where X is the polling average on July 15, 2024. Using a normal distribution calculator, we get: P(2 < X \u2264 3) \u2248 0.3413.

Given the dynamic nature of political polls, especially in the context of a presidential election, predicting the exact lead margin can be challenging. However, we can make an educated guess based on historical trends and the current political climate. Assuming that the election is competitive, a lead of more than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points for Trump seems plausible but not highly likely, given the typical polling margins and the fact that the election is still more than a year away.

'The Wolverine' (2013) opened with $53,113,752, which was also a respectable performance. The combined opening of these two movies is $185,548,391. The new movie, 'Deadpool & Wolverine', brings together two popular characters from the X-Men universe, which could potentially attract a larger audience. The success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has shown that combining popular characters can lead to significant box office success. Additionally, the popularity of the Deadpool character has continued to grow since the release of the first movie, which could contribute to a higher opening weekend. However, it's also possible that the combined movie may not perform as well as the sum of its individual parts.

Lee Isaac Chung, the director of \"Twisters\" (2024), has received critical acclaim for his film \"Minari\" (2020), which has a 98% Rotten Tomatoes score. Glen Powell, one of the stars, was in \"Top Gun: Maverick\" (2022), which has a 96% Rotten Tomatoes score.

As of the question's creation date (April 13, 2024), the 2024 presidential election is still several months away, and the polling landscape may change significantly before July 15, 2024. However, I can make an educated estimate based on current trends and the typical dynamics of presidential elections. Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that polling averages can fluctuate over time due to various factors, such as changes in voter sentiment, campaign events, and external factors like economic conditions or global events. As of April 13, 2024, the polling average on FiveThirtyEight shows a relatively close race between Trump and Biden. However, it's difficult to predict with certainty how the polling average will evolve over the next three months. Given the uncertainty and the potential for significant changes in the polling landscape, I'll consider a few factors that might influence the outcome: 1. Historical trends: In recent presidential elections, polling averages have often narrowed as the election approaches. This could suggest that Trump's lead, if it exists, might decrease as the election draws closer. 2. Campaign dynamics: The Trump and Biden campaigns will likely engage in intense campaigning, debates, and advertising, which can impact voter sentiment and polling numbers. 3. External factors: Unforeseen events, such as economic shifts, global conflicts, or significant news stories, can influence voter opinions and polling averages. Considering these factors, I'll estimate the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, as follows: Probability: 0.25. This probability reflects my uncertainty about the polling average on July 15, 2024, and the potential for significant changes in the polling landscape between now and then.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge the long-standing tensions and hostility between Israel and Iran, with both countries having a history of engaging in military actions and proxy wars in the region. Israel has been vocal about its concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program and has taken military action against Iranian targets in the past. However, it's also crucial to consider the current geopolitical landscape. The United States and other Western countries have been involved in diplomatic efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal, which could potentially ease tensions between Iran and the West. Additionally, Israel has been engaged in normalization talks with several Arab countries, which might reduce the likelihood of a large-scale conflict with Iran.

The VXVCLS index measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 index over the next three months. It is a widely followed indicator of market sentiment and is often used as a gauge of investor fear and uncertainty. Historically, the VXVCLS index has been subject to significant fluctuations, often in response to changes in market conditions, economic indicators, and geopolitical events. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the index will be higher or lower on a specific date in the future. That being said, we can look at some general trends and factors that may influence the VXVCLS index. For example, if the market is experiencing a period of high volatility, the VXVCLS index is likely to be higher. Conversely, if the market is experiencing a period of low volatility, the VXVCLS index is likely to be lower.

In recent Olympics, we've seen players like Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray achieve this feat. Given the strong field of tennis players expected to compete in Paris, it's reasonable to assume that at least one athlete will win multiple medals in tennis. Condition (b) pertains to Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) collectively winning 21 or more gold medals. INAs are athletes who compete under the Olympic flag, often due to their home country being suspended or withdrawn from the Olympics. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) competed as INAs due to a doping ban, and they won a total of 20 gold medals. However, it's essential to note that the number of INAs and their competitiveness can vary greatly from one Olympics to another.

This suggests that while Biden is willing to participate in longer interviews, they are not common. Given that the market does not include press conferences, speeches, rallies, fundraisers, town halls, etc., and requires at least 45 minutes of new footage of Biden being interviewed in-person, the bar is set relatively high.

(a) Joe Biden having an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024: Given the frequency of presidential appearances in various media formats, it's plausible that Joe Biden could participate in an in-person interview or conversation that meets the specified duration. However, the requirement for at least 45 minutes of new footage being in-person and on-camera narrows down the possibilities, as many interviews or conversations might not meet this specific criterion due to editing or format constraints. Estimated Probability for (a): Given the specificity of the conditions (in-person, on-camera, 45+ minutes, and excluding certain types of events), this event seems somewhat likely but not highly probable due to the constraints. A reasonable estimate might be around 0.4 (or 40%), considering the regularity of presidential media appearances but also the specific requirements that need to be met. (b) Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average: The 2024 presidential election polling landscape is subject to significant variability due to numerous factors, including but not limited to, current events, candidate actions, and shifts in public opinion. Predicting a lead within a specific narrow margin (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4) is challenging due to the inherent volatility of polling data. Estimated Probability for (b): Given the specificity of the margin (a lead of more than 3 but less than or equal to 4 points) and the dynamic nature of polling averages, this scenario seems less likely than a broader prediction of Trump leading or trailing by any margin. A reasonable estimate for such a specific outcome might be lower, around 0.15 (or 15%), acknowledging the difficulty in pinpointing polling averages to such a narrow range. Combined Probability for Either Event Occurring: To find the probability of either event (a) or (b) occurring, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), assuming the events are independent. However, since we're estimating and the events are distinct (one political appearance and one polling outcome), we'll simplify by adding the probabilities and then subtracting a small overlap to avoid double-counting any potential shared probability space, though in reality, these events are likely independent. Combined Probability = P(a) + P(b) - (small overlap) = 0.4 + 0.15 - 0.05 (assuming a small 5% overlap for simplicity) = 0.5. Reasoning: The combined probability reflects a moderate likelihood of either of the specified events occurring, leaning towards a higher chance due to the broader possibilities encompassed by event (a) and the specific, though less likely, scenario of event (b).

Event (1): At least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early. The context from Politico suggests that there is a growing discontent among House Democrats regarding the plan to nominate Biden early. A drafted letter circulated by Rep. Jared Huffman has gained traction, and dozens of House Democrats are organizing to speak out against the plan. While it's difficult to predict the exact number of signatories, the fact that a significant number of Democrats are already involved in the effort increases the likelihood of reaching the threshold of 20 signatures. Event (2): Larry Elder is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Larry Elder is a well-known conservative figure, but his chances of becoming the Republican nominee are uncertain. The Republican National Convention is a complex process, and the nomination outcome depends on various factors, including delegate support, party dynamics, and the performance of other candidates. Without more information on the current state of the Republican primary or Elder's campaign, it's challenging to estimate his chances accurately. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the nomination process is inherently unpredictable, and Elder's chances, although uncertain, are not negligible. Combining the probabilities: Given the information available, I would estimate the probability of Event (1) occurring as relatively higher, around 0.6-0.7, due to the growing discontent among House Democrats and the organized effort to oppose the early nomination plan. For Event (2), I would estimate the probability of Larry Elder becoming the Republican nominee as lower, around 0.2-0.3, due to the uncertainty and complexity of the nomination process. Since the question asks for the probability of either event occurring, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Assuming independence between the two events, we can simplify this to P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B).

However, given the variability in Season 2, it's possible that the show could bounce back with a highly rated episode. 4. Season Finale: S2E8 is a season finale, which often tends to receive higher ratings due to the culmination of plotlines and the anticipation built up throughout the season. This could work in favor of a higher rating. 5.
