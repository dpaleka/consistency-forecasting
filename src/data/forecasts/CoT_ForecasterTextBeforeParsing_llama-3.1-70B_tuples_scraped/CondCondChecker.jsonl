However, it indicates that OpenAI is actively expanding its services and may be more likely to engage in transparency efforts, such as publishing a red-teaming report. Secondly, the diplomatic actions between the Philippines and China are also not directly related to OpenAI's publication of a red-teaming report. However, it could potentially create a geopolitical environment where companies like OpenAI may be more cautious in their actions, potentially leading to a delay or cancellation of the report. Thirdly, OpenAI has been actively engaging in transparency efforts, such as publishing research papers and blog posts about their models. This suggests that they may be open to publishing a red-teaming report, especially if it is conducted by an external party. Lastly, the timeframe of June 30, 2024, is relatively short, and it is uncertain whether OpenAI would be able to conduct and publish a red-teaming report within this timeframe.

Assuming she decides to run again and doesn't face significant opposition, her chances of being nominated are relatively high. However, this is still a uncertain event. Condition 2: Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This condition is highly uncertain and depends on various legal and political factors. While there have been discussions about using Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to bar Trump from the ballot, it's unclear whether this will actually happen. The legal process is complex, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Condition 3: Democrats having a brokered convention in 2024. A brokered convention is more likely to occur when there is a highly contested primary with multiple strong candidates. Given the current state of the Democratic Party, it's possible that there could be a brokered convention. However, this is also uncertain and depends on various factors, including the number of candidates, their popularity, and the primary election results. To combine these conditions, we need to consider the probability of all three events occurring. Since these events are not independent, we cannot simply multiply their individual probabilities. However, we can make an educated estimate based on our understanding of each condition."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.004825024295102738, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0012062560737756845, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.11491831972258043, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

To solve this, we need to consider the relationship between the qualification of Armenia and Belgium. In the context of Eurovision, each country's qualification is determined by a combination of jury and public voting. The qualification of one country does not directly affect the qualification of another country. However, we can consider some indirect factors that might influence the probability. One possible factor is the musical style or genre of the songs performed by Armenia and Belgium. If both countries have similar styles or genres, it's possible that they might appeal to similar voter demographics, which could increase the likelihood of both qualifying. On the other hand, if their styles are vastly different, it's possible that they might appeal to different demographics, making it less likely for both to qualify. Another factor to consider is the overall quality of the songs and performances. If Armenia has a strong song and performance, it's possible that the jury and public might also appreciate Belgium's entry, increasing their chances of qualification. However, without knowing the specific details of the songs and performances, it's challenging to make a precise estimate. Therefore, I will rely on historical data and general trends.

However, considering the uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes, a rough estimate might be around 10-20%. Event (2) concerns the percentage of Manifold respondents agreeing that weak AGI has been achieved before July 23, 2024. The definition of weak AGI is subjective and can vary among respondents. As of the question's creation date, there is no information available about the July 2024 poll results. However, considering the growing interest and advancements in AI research, it's possible that a significant percentage of respondents might agree that weak AGI has been achieved. A rough estimate for this event might be around 30-40%. Event (3) involves Joe Biden announcing that he is dropping out of the presidential race and resigning from the presidency before the end of July 2024. This event is highly uncertain and depends on various factors, including Biden's health, political circumstances, and personal decisions. As of the question's creation date, there is no indication that Biden plans to drop out or resign. Given the low probability of such an event, a rough estimate might be around 1-5%. To estimate the combined probability of all three events occurring, we need to consider their independence and potential correlations. Assuming independence, we can multiply the individual probabilities. However, due to the high uncertainty and potential correlations between the events (e.g., Biden's resignation might affect the polling average), it's essential to be cautious and adjust the combined probability downward. Considering the rough estimates and potential correlations, a combined probability estimate might be around 0.1% to 1%. However, this is a very rough estimate and should be taken as a rough order of magnitude rather than a precise prediction."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 7.731411047851282e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 1.9328527619628206e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.015721249524260263, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, without access to real-time market data or current events as of my cut-off knowledge date (01 December 2023), it's challenging to make an accurate prediction. Given the time frame between my knowledge cut-off and the resolution date, many factors can influence the market, such as economic indicators, geopolitical events, and company performance. That being said, we can make a general assessment based on typical market behavior. The BSE SENSEX has historically experienced fluctuations, and the range of 75k to 77k seems reasonable given the index's past performance. However, predicting the exact range for a specific date is inherently uncertain. Assuming no significant global events or economic downturns occur between my knowledge cut-off and the resolution date, we can make an educated estimate.

Event (a): The closing value of BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024, being greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k. Reasoning: Historical data shows that the BSE SENSEX has been relatively stable in recent years, with some fluctuations. However, predicting the exact value of the index on a specific date is challenging due to various market and economic factors. Given the range of 75k to 77k, it's a relatively narrow window. Assuming a normal distribution of possible values, I'd estimate the probability of the index falling within this range as moderate. Probability: 0.3. Event (b): Joe Biden dying before Saturday (July 27, 2024). Reasoning: Joe Biden's current age is 81, and while he has had some health issues, there is no public information suggesting a terminal illness or imminent danger to his life. Actuarial tables suggest that the probability of an 81-year-old male dying within a short period (in this case, about 3 weeks) is relatively low. Probability: 0.05. Event (c): Joe Biden announcing that he is both dropping out and resigning from the presidency before the end of July. Reasoning: There is no credible information or indication that Joe Biden plans to drop out of the presidential race or resign from office. In fact, he has announced his intention to run for re-election. This event seems highly unlikely. Probability: 0.01.

Legal Proceedings: As of my last update, there are ongoing legal proceedings against Donald Trump in various jurisdictions, including Georgia. The case in question involves allegations related to election interference, among other charges. Witness tampering is a serious offense that can be charged if there is evidence that Trump attempted to influence or intimidate witnesses in this case. 2. Investigative Activity: The investigation into Trump's activities in Georgia has been active, with the Fulton County District Attorney's office leading the probe. If investigators find evidence of witness tampering, charges could be forthcoming. 3. Timing: The question specifies that charges must be brought before June 1, 2024. Given the complexity of legal investigations and the time required to gather evidence, it's plausible that charges could be filed within this timeframe if sufficient evidence of witness tampering is found. 4. Precedent and Legal Climate: The legal climate and precedent for charging high-profile figures with crimes related to election interference and witness tampering can influence the likelihood of such charges. However, each case is judged on its merits, and the specifics of the evidence against Trump in this context would be crucial. Given these considerations, while there is a plausible scenario in which Trump could be charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024, the outcome is highly dependent on the specifics of the investigation's findings and the legal process.

First, let's consider the probability of Larry Elder being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. While Larry Elder is a well-known figure in Republican circles, his chances of becoming the nominee are uncertain and depend on various factors such as the primary elections, party dynamics, and the overall political landscape.

First, let's consider the conditions: (a) A single nation wins more than one women's team sport. Historically, the United States has been strong in women's team sports, often competing at a high level in multiple disciplines. However, the condition specifies that the same National Olympic Committee (NOC) must win gold in more than one of these sports. While the USA has a broad base of talent, this condition doesn't necessarily favor them exclusively, as other nations like China, Australia, and European countries also have strong programs in various women's team sports. (b) Individual Neutral Athletes (INA) collectively win 21 or more gold medals. This condition is quite specific and depends on various factors, including the participation and performance of athletes from Russia and other countries that might compete under the INA banner due to sanctions or other reasons. The number of 21 or more gold medals is significant and would likely impact the overall medal standings, potentially affecting the USA's chances of topping the table. Given these conditions, we must consider how they might influence the USA's position in the medal table. The USA has traditionally been one of the top-performing countries at the Olympics, with a strong presence across a wide range of sports. However, the conditions specified could potentially alter the dynamics, especially if the INA's performance significantly impacts the medal count of other nations. Reasoning through the potential outcomes: - The USA's performance in women's team sports is likely to be strong, but the condition that another nation must win more than one gold in these sports introduces uncertainty. It's plausible that the USA could still perform well overall but face stiff competition in these specific sports. - The performance of INA athletes winning 21 or more gold medals could significantly alter the medal standings. If these athletes were to otherwise compete for Russia or another nation, their medals could bolster that country's total. However, as INA, their medals are counted separately, which could potentially allow the USA to maintain a higher ranking if they perform well across the board. Considering these factors, while the conditions introduce uncertainty and potential challenges for the USA, they do not necessarily preclude the USA from topping the medal table. The USA's broad strength across many Olympic sports provides a solid foundation. However, the specific conditions, especially the performance of INA athletes, introduce variables that could affect the final standings. Given the complexity and the specific conditions, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. However, considering the USA's historical performance and the factors at play, a reasonable estimate might lean towards a lower probability of the USA topping the medal table under these specific conditions, simply due to the introduced uncertainties and challenges."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "65bc1b85-d17e-4dbc-8fe2-145a8912798c", "title": "Will both of the following occur at the Paris 2024 Olympics: (1) The same nation wins more than one women's team sport and Individual Neutral Athletes win 21 or more gold medals, and (2) The USA tops the Olympic Medal Table?", "body": "This question resolves to Yes if all of the following conditions are met at the Paris 2024 Olympics: \n\n1.

The Philippines has been a key player in the US's 'pivot to Asia' strategy, and the US has maintained a significant military presence in the region. Given these factors, it is possible that the incapacitation of President Biden could lead to increased diplomatic tensions between the Philippines and China, potentially resulting in expulsions or recalls of diplomats. However, it is also possible that the US's foreign policy apparatus, including the State Department and the Pentagon, would continue to function relatively smoothly, minimizing the impact of the presidential incapacitation on US-Philippines-China relations. Therefore, while there is a plausible scenario in which diplomatic expulsions or recalls could occur, it is not a certainty. The probability of such an event occurring before August 1, 2024, is difficult to estimate with precision, but it seems more likely than not that some form of diplomatic tension would arise in the wake of a presidential incapacitation."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "f204d019-8dad-4861-a6e1-d95a2ca8d527", "title": "Given both Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 and diplomatic expulsions or recalls occur between the Philippines and China before August 2024, will Biden remain President through end of July 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Before August 2024, (a) Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4, meaning the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,\" causing the Vice President to serve as Acting President, and (b) Diplomatic expulsions or recalls take place between the Philippines and China, meaning one of these events occurs: The Philippines expels or recalls at least one diplomat representing the People's Republic of China (PRC), or the PRC expels or recalls at least one diplomat representing the Philippines.\n\nThen, given these conditions, will Biden remain US President through the end of July 2024 (ET)?

However, as of my last update, there isn't widespread public information indicating a severe downturn in Biden's standing within the party that would prompt such action. 3.

Kamala Harris as VP: If Kamala Harris is nominated as the Democratic VP, it is likely that Biden will want to maintain a strong public image and demonstrate his ability to work with his running mate. Participating in a long-form interview would allow him to showcase their relationship and policy alignment. 2. Pressure from Democratic lawmakers: If at least 5 Democratic lawmakers publicly pressure Biden to drop out, it may create a sense of urgency for him to address concerns and demonstrate his commitment to the campaign. A lengthy on-camera interview could provide an opportunity for Biden to respond to these concerns and reassure voters. 3. Campaign strategy: In the context of a presidential campaign, it is common for candidates to participate in interviews to connect with voters, address concerns, and showcase their policies. Given the circumstances, it is likely that Biden's campaign team would see value in having him participate in a substantial on-camera interview to counterbalance the negative narrative. 4. Timeframe: The timeframe for the interview is before the end of July 2024, which is still relatively early in the campaign season.

However, it is unclear how this event would directly impact the likelihood of a reliable media outlet covering Joe Biden's dropout in advance. The two events seem unrelated, and the imprisonment of Maria Corina Machado does not provide any obvious information about Joe Biden's plans or the media's ability to cover his dropout.

The condition for this question to be considered is the occurrence of another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention. Given the nature of U.S. presidential election cycles and the typical frequency of debates during the primary season, it is reasonable to anticipate at least one more debate. However, the exact number and scheduling of these debates can be influenced by various factors, including the number of candidates, their popularity, and the decisions of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Despite these uncertainties, it's plausible to assume that for a competitive primary, debates will continue to be a platform for candidates to engage with voters. The outcome we're evaluating is the Greens-EFA group holding the most seats in the European Parliament after the 2024 elections. The Greens-EFA has been a significant political force in the European Parliament, advocating for environmental policies, social justice, and human rights. However, whether they will hold the most seats is subject to a multitude of factors, including voter sentiment across the EU, the performance of other political groups, and the impact of the European political landscape at the time of the elections. Given these considerations, the two events (another Democratic party presidential debate and the Greens-EFA holding the most seats in the European Parliament) are largely independent. The occurrence of a debate in the U.S. does not directly influence the political dynamics within the European Union or the electoral success of the Greens-EFA. The probability of another Democratic party presidential debate occurring seems relatively high, given the context of a competitive primary season. However, this is not the question we are directly answering. The probability of the Greens-EFA holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections is more challenging to estimate without current polling data or a deeper analysis of European political trends. Historically, the Greens-EFA has had significant representation but holding the most seats would be a notable achievement, especially considering the political diversity and the presence of larger blocs like the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists and Democrats (S&D). Given the lack of direct correlation between the two events and the uncertainty surrounding the European elections, the probability estimate should reflect the independent nature of these events. However, since we are asked for a single probability and the condition (another Democratic debate) does not influence the outcome (Greens-EFA holding the most seats), we focus on the feasibility of the Greens-EFA outcome.

The qualification is based on a combination of jury and public voting. The top 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final. Given that Lithuania qualifies for the Grand Final, this information alone does not directly influence Slovenia's qualification chances, as the voting and qualification process for each country is independent.

However, without specific details about Slovenia's performance, song quality, and the competition within its semi-final, it's challenging to accurately predict its qualification chances based solely on Lithuania's qualification. Eurovision outcomes can be highly unpredictable due to the subjective nature of music preferences and the voting system. Given this, the most reasonable approach is to rely on general trends and past data.

Given the historical volatility of currency markets, it's difficult to predict the exact exchange rate more than three years in advance.

Event (b) involves Kimberly Cheatle's tenure as the director of the Secret Service. As of my knowledge cutoff, I don't have information about her current status or any potential changes.

Historically, polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as debates, scandals, and changes in the political landscape. Given the volatility of polling numbers and the time frame, it's difficult to accurately predict a specific range for Trump's lead. However, considering the question's specificity (a lead greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4), this outcome seems relatively narrow and less likely compared to broader ranges. (b) Chris Christie being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Chris Christie has expressed interest in running for the presidency but faces significant competition from other potential candidates, including Donald Trump. The Republican nomination process is inherently unpredictable, with various factors influencing the outcome, such as debate performances, fundraising, and endorsements. While Christie has a strong political background, his chances of securing the nomination are uncertain and likely dependent on various factors, including Trump's decision to run.

Condition 1: Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024. This condition is highly uncertain and depends on various factors, including legal challenges, court decisions, and state government actions.

Condition 2: The BJP forms the government after the next Indian general election in 2024.

To assess this probability, we need to consider the likelihood of the condition being met (the market having at least 377 traders) and the likelihood of the outcome (Biden being declared incapacitated) given that condition. First, let's consider the condition. The market having at least 377 traders by the end of July 15 is a specific and measurable event. We can look at historical data on the market's trader numbers to estimate the likelihood of this event occurring. However, without access to real-time data, it's challenging to provide an accurate estimate. Nevertheless, we can make an educated guess based on general trends. Assuming the market has been growing steadily, it's possible that it will reach 377 traders by the end of July 15. Let's assign a moderate probability to this event, say 0.6. Now, let's consider the outcome. The 25th Amendment Section 4 is a rarely invoked provision that requires a significant level of consensus among the Vice President and the Cabinet (or other relevant body) that the President is unable to discharge their duties. Given the current political climate and the fact that Biden has been serving as President without any major incidents, it's unlikely that he will be declared incapacitated in the near future. Let's assign a low probability to this event, say 0.1. To calculate the conditional probability, we need to multiply the probability of the condition by the probability of the outcome given the condition. However, since the condition and outcome are not independent, we need to consider the relationship between them. In this case, the condition (market having at least 377 traders) does not directly affect the outcome (Biden being declared incapacitated). Therefore, we can assume independence and calculate the conditional probability as follows: Conditional probability = Probability of condition x Probability of outcome given condition = 0.6 x 0.1 = 0.06."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "6e03ecb3-2570-44e1-9519-19ce7001f647", "title": "Given both the linked market gets at least 377 traders by July 15 and Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment before August, will Trump be charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: (1) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, 2024, Pacific Time, and (2) Joe Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024 Eastern Time.

One factor is the overall quality and competitiveness of the songs and performances in the semi-finals. If Australia's qualification is an indicator of a strong field of competitors in their semi-final, it might suggest that the competition is fierce, and Georgia might face a tougher challenge in their own semi-final.

To assess this probability, we need to consider the potential impact of Cheatle's resignation on the political landscape and the likelihood of Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out. Firstly, the resignation of the head of the Secret Service could potentially create a political scandal or controversy, especially if it is related to the agency's performance or a specific incident. This could lead to increased scrutiny of the Biden administration and potentially damage the President's reputation. However, it is essential to note that the resignation of a high-ranking official like Cheatle is not necessarily a direct indicator of the President's performance or popularity. The Secret Service is an independent agency, and its director's resignation might not have a significant impact on the presidential race. Moreover, calling for a President to drop out of a race is a significant political move, and Senators typically do not take such actions lightly.

This tense relationship increases the likelihood of conflict. Secondly, there have been instances of attacks attributed to Iran or its proxies within Israel and the surrounding region. For example, in 2021, there were reports of missile attacks from Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, a group supported by Iran. However, the question specifically asks about an attack within Israel's borders that results in at least five deaths, which narrows the scope. Thirdly, considering the timeline from the question's publication in 2021 to the resolution date in 2024, there is ample time for geopolitical tensions to escalate or de-escalate. The Middle East is a volatile region, and the situation can change rapidly due to various factors, including political developments, military actions, or changes in international relations. Lastly, while predicting specific violent events is inherently challenging due to the multitude of variables involved, the historical context and ongoing tensions suggest that the possibility of such an attack cannot be ruled out.

First, let's consider the impact of the Iranian attack in Israel.

Apple is one of the world's largest companies by market capitalization, often ranking in the top three, while Nvidia, although a leader in the semiconductor industry, especially in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) chips, has a substantially smaller market capitalization. 2. Growth Trends: Nvidia has been growing rapidly, driven by the increasing demand for its GPUs in gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive markets, as well as its leadership in AI computing. However, Apple's market capitalization is so large that Nvidia would need to experience extraordinary growth to surpass it. 3. Market Volatility: The tech sector, in particular, can be highly volatile, with market capitalizations fluctuating significantly based on earnings reports, product announcements, and broader market trends. However, the difference in scale between Apple and Nvidia is substantial, making it less likely for Nvidia to surpass Apple in market capitalization in a short period. 4.

To assess this probability, we need to consider the relationship between the two events. First, we note that the market capitalization of Nvidia and Apple is not directly related to the outcome of the 2024 presidential election or the polling averages. The market capitalization of a company is determined by various factors such as its financial performance, industry trends, and investor sentiment, whereas the outcome of the presidential election is influenced by a complex array of factors including political, economic, and social issues. Given the lack of a direct relationship between the two events, it is reasonable to assume that the outcome of one event does not affect the probability of the other event. Therefore, the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, is not influenced by the market capitalization of Nvidia and Apple on June 28, 2024. To estimate the probability of Trump's lead over Biden, we would need to consider various factors such as the current polling trends, the candidates' popularity, and the overall political landscape. However, since this information is not provided in the question, we cannot make an informed estimate of the probability. In the absence of any relevant information, we can only rely on our prior beliefs about the probability of Trump's lead over Biden. Without any specific information to update our prior beliefs, we can assign a uniform prior distribution to the possible range of Trump's lead over Biden. Assuming a uniform prior distribution, the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 is simply the proportion of the possible range that falls within this interval. Since the possible range of Trump's lead over Biden is not specified, we can assume a reasonable range, for example, between -10 and 10. Within this range, the interval [3, 4] corresponds to a proportion of 1/17 (since there are 17 possible intervals of length 1 within the range [-10, 10]).

The presence of female candidates increases the likelihood of a female nominee. 2.

His dropout might create an opportunity for other candidates, including women, to gain more traction and support. 3.

We're asked to determine if these conditions influence the outcome of the USA winning more Gold medals than Silver medals. First, consider condition (a): an athlete winning more than one medal in tennis. This is a specific event that doesn't directly influence the overall medal count of a country unless the athlete in question is from the USA and wins multiple Gold medals, which would be a rare but impactful occurrence. However, this condition alone doesn't significantly sway the overall outcome of the USA winning more Gold than Silver medals, as the total number of medals in tennis is a small fraction of the total medals awarded across all sports. Next, consider condition (b): at least 24 world records being broken. This indicates a high level of competitiveness and exceptional performances across various sports. While this could imply a higher potential for winning medals, it doesn't directly correlate with the USA winning more Gold than Silver medals, as these record-breaking performances could come from any country. Given these conditions, we must assess the general likelihood of the USA winning more Gold medals than Silver medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Historically, the USA has performed well in the Olympics, often ranking among the top countries in terms of overall medals and Gold medals.

When selecting a running mate, she would consider various factors such as political experience, popularity, and ideological alignment. Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are both viable candidates, but there are many other potential running mates she could choose from. Mark Kelly is a moderate Democrat with a strong track record in Arizona, a crucial swing state. He has experience in the Senate and has been a vocal advocate for gun control and climate action.

Biden's Resignation: The probability of Joe Biden resigning and not completing his current term before the end of July 2024 is difficult to estimate due to the lack of concrete evidence or signals from the Biden administration. However, it's not unprecedented for U.S. presidents to resign or not seek re-election. Given the current political climate and Biden's age, I'd estimate this probability as relatively low, around 0.2. 2. Harris's Pick for Running Mate: If Biden were to resign, Kamala Harris would likely become the Democratic nominee. The choice of running mate is highly uncertain and depends on various factors, including political strategy, personal relationships, and party dynamics. Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are both plausible choices, but there are many other potential candidates. I'd estimate the probability of Harris picking either Kelly or Shapiro as her running mate at around 0.3. 3. Israel's Military Operations: The probability of Israel expanding its ground invasion to Rafah before June 1, 2024, is highly dependent on the geopolitical situation in the region, which is inherently unpredictable. However, given the historical context of Israeli-Palestinian conflicts and the current tensions, it's possible that Israel might launch military operations in Gaza, including Rafah. I'd estimate this probability as around 0.4. 4. Conditional Probability: Since the question is conditional on both Biden resigning and Harris picking Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro, we need to multiply the probabilities of these events occurring. Assuming independence, the joint probability would be 0.2 (Biden resigning) \u00d7 0.3 (Harris picking Kelly or Shapiro) = 0.06. 5. Final Probability: Given the conditional probability of 0.06, we need to estimate the probability of Israel expanding its ground invasion to Rafah before June 1, 2024, assuming these conditions are met. Since the conditions are unrelated to Israel's military operations, we can use the standalone probability of 0.4. However, considering the low probability of the conditions being met, we should adjust this probability downward. A reasonable estimate would be to multiply 0.4 by the conditional probability of 0.06, resulting in a final probability of approximately 0.024."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "1e04695f-0a04-4749-a81a-6cf3d9e13cc8", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (1) Joe Biden announces he is both dropping out and resigning from the presidency before the end of July 2024, (2) Kamala Harris announces her VP pick as either Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro, and (3) Israel expands its ground invasion to the city of Rafah before June 1, 2024?", "body": "(1) Resolves YES if Joe Biden announces both that he is no longer running for re-election and that he will be resigning and not completing his current term before the end of July 2024 in Pacific Time.

Linda Yaccarino's tenure as Twitter CEO might have some impact on the tech industry or social media landscape, but it's unlikely to have a significant effect on the BSE SENSEX, which is primarily influenced by Indian economic indicators and market trends. Joe Biden's announcement about not seeking re-election might have some impact on global markets, particularly in the US, but its effect on the BSE SENSEX would likely be indirect and minimal. The Indian economy and stock market are more closely tied to domestic factors, such as the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy, government initiatives, and global trade dynamics.

This could be due to various factors, such as Biden's personal characteristics, policy positions, or the perception of his candidacy. On the other hand, a generic Democrat might be seen as a more abstract or neutral option, which could attract a broader range of voters.

Let's analyze each condition separately: (a) Facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents: This condition depends on the outcome of two Manifold polls, which are not necessarily representative of the general public. However, considering the consistent public opinion polls showing Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, it's plausible that Trump might gain more votes when facing Biden specifically. Still, a 3% gain is a relatively significant margin, and it's uncertain whether Manifold respondents will behave similarly to the general public.

Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's national polling average for the 2024 presidential election is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024. This is according to the chart for the date of July 15, 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024. A positive value indicates a Trump lead.

The question will resolve as \"No\" if this does not occur, unless the general election is cancelled or postponed beyond July 4, 2024, in which case the question will be annulled. Resolution should cite credible media reports from the BBC, the Times, the Financial Times, the Guardian, or other major UK news sources; or the official announcement of the returning officer for any constituency in which Nigel Farage is a candidate.

To estimate the probability of this question resolving to YES, we need to consider the likelihood of each condition being met. For condition (1), we need to consider the current polling trends and the historical variability of polling data. As of the knowledge cutoff, the polling average on 538 shows a narrow lead for Trump, but this can change rapidly due to various factors such as campaign events, debates, and external events. Given the uncertainty and variability of polling data, it's challenging to predict the exact margin of Trump's lead on a specific date. However, considering the current trend and historical data, it's possible that Trump's lead could be within the specified range on July 15, 2024. For condition (2), Nigel Farage's election as a Member of Parliament depends on various factors, including the performance of his party, the Brexit Party, in the UK General Election. As of the knowledge cutoff, the Brexit Party has been gaining momentum, but the UK electoral system and the performance of other parties can affect the outcome. Farage's popularity and the Brexit Party's chances of winning seats in the election are uncertain, making it difficult to predict his election as an MP. Given the uncertainty and complexity of both conditions, it's challenging to estimate the probability of this question resolving to YES. However, considering the current trends and historical data, I would estimate the probability of condition (1) being met as around 0.3, and the probability of condition (2) being met as around 0.2.

The control of Chasiv Yar is likely to be influenced by factors such as military actions, political decisions, and geopolitical events, rather than a single event like an interview with Biden. However, it's worth noting that the interview condition might be related to the overall political climate and the level of international attention on the conflict in Ukraine. If Biden's interview is seen as a significant event that draws attention to the conflict, it could potentially influence the dynamics of the conflict, including the control of Chasiv Yar.

A brokered convention occurs when no candidate receives a majority of delegates during the initial voting round, leading to subsequent rounds of voting. This scenario often indicates a divided party or a lack of clear consensus around a candidate. In the context of the 2024 US presidential election, if the Democratic Party requires more than one round of voting to formally nominate its candidate, it may suggest that Biden does not have overwhelming support among party delegates. This lack of support could potentially lead to some Democratic Senators questioning Biden's viability as a candidate or even calling for him to drop out. However, it's essential to note that Senators' public statements and actions are often influenced by various factors, including their own political ambitions, constituent opinions, and party dynamics. While a brokered convention might create an environment where some Senators feel more comfortable expressing doubts about Biden, it's uncertain whether 10 or more Senators would explicitly call for him to drop out before July 20. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20, conditional on a brokered convention, to be relatively low.

If both conditions are met, we need to determine if the same nation will win more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics. To estimate the probability of this happening, let's break it down into smaller parts. First, the probability of the New York Knicks winning the 2024 NBA Finals is difficult to estimate, as it depends on various factors such as team performance, injuries, and other teams' strengths. However, we can assume that the Knicks have a reasonable chance of winning, given that they are a professional team competing in the NBA. Second, the probability of the USA topping the Olympic Medal Table at Paris 2024 is also uncertain, as it depends on the performance of athletes from various countries. However, the USA has historically been a strong performer at the Olympics, so we can assume that they have a good chance of topping the medal table. Now, assuming that both conditions are met, we need to estimate the probability of the same nation winning more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics. This requires us to consider the competitiveness of each sport and the strength of the teams participating. While it's difficult to make an accurate estimate, we can assume that the probability of the same nation winning multiple sports is relatively low, given the diversity of teams and athletes competing in each sport.

(a) The Month-over-Month US Core CPI increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024: Historically, the Core CPI has shown a relatively stable and low-volatility trend. However, there have been instances of higher month-over-month increases, especially during periods of economic recovery or supply chain disruptions. Given the current economic conditions and the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, it's possible that the Core CPI might experience a slight increase. However, predicting a specific threshold of 0.1% is challenging. Assuming a normal distribution of Core CPI changes, I'd estimate the probability of exceeding 0.1% to be around 30-40%. This is a rough estimate, as it's difficult to accurately forecast economic indicators. (b) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average: Predicting election polling averages is inherently uncertain, as it depends on various factors like voter sentiment, campaign strategies, and external events. However, we can look at historical trends and the current polling landscape. As of now, the 2024 presidential election is still far away, and polling numbers can fluctuate significantly. Assuming a relatively stable polling environment, I'd estimate the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) to be around 20-30%. This is a rough estimate, as polling numbers can change rapidly. (c) Israel expand its ground invasion to the city of Rafah before June 1, 2024: This event is highly dependent on geopolitical developments and the complex dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Without access to real-time information on the current situation, it's challenging to provide an accurate estimate. However, considering the historical context and the ongoing tensions in the region, I'd estimate the probability of Israel expanding its ground invasion to Rafah before June 1, 2024, to be around 40-50%. This is a rough estimate, as the situation can change rapidly. To combine these estimates, we need to assume independence between the events. This might not be entirely accurate, as economic and geopolitical events can be interconnected. However, for the sake of simplicity, let's assume independence. The probability of all three events occurring can be estimated by multiplying the individual probabilities: P(a) \u2248 0.35 ( rough estimate) P(b) \u2248 0.25 ( rough estimate) P(c) \u2248 0.45 ( rough estimate) P(a \u2229 b \u2229 c) \u2248 P(a) \u00d7 P(b) \u00d7 P(c) \u2248 0.35 \u00d7 0.25 \u00d7 0.45 \u2248 0.039. So, the estimated probability of all three events occurring is approximately 3.9%. Reasoning: The estimates for each event are rough and based on historical trends, current conditions, and the complexity of the events. The combined probability is low due to the independence assumption and the relatively low individual probabilities."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.01813223209248495, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.004533058023121237, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17701399468733048, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, let's analyze condition (a). The attendance of Mayor Wilson at the Roswell City Council Open Forum on July 29, 2024, is an event that is largely unrelated to the US Core CPI. The Core CPI is a macroeconomic indicator that measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services, and it is influenced by a wide range of factors, including monetary policy, economic growth, and supply and demand. The attendance of a local mayor at a city council meeting is unlikely to have a significant impact on the Core CPI. Next, let's analyze condition (b). Trump's lead over Biden in the national polling average on July 15, 2024, is also unrelated to the US Core CPI. The Core CPI is a measure of inflation, and it is not directly influenced by political events or election polls. While it is possible that a change in the political landscape could lead to changes in economic policy, which in turn could affect inflation, the relationship between election polls and the Core CPI is indirect and uncertain. Given that both conditions are unrelated to the US Core CPI, we can conclude that the probability of the Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024 is independent of these conditions. Therefore, we can ignore the conditions and focus on the underlying factors that influence the Core CPI. The US Core CPI has been trending upward in recent years, driven by a strong labor market and rising wages. However, the rate of inflation has been relatively stable, and the Federal Reserve has been working to keep inflation in check through monetary policy. Given this context, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the Core CPI will increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024.

First, we should note that the conditions given in the question do not directly relate to the likelihood of the Democratic Party having a brokered convention. The Secret Service director's resignation and the GOP nominee do not directly influence the internal dynamics of the Democratic Party's nomination process. However, we can consider some indirect implications. If Doug Burgum, a relatively moderate candidate, becomes the GOP nominee, it might lead to a more competitive general election, which could potentially influence the Democratic Party's nomination dynamics. Nevertheless, this connection is quite speculative and does not provide strong evidence for a brokered convention. A brokered convention typically occurs when no candidate has a clear majority of delegates before the convention, often due to a highly contested primary with multiple strong candidates. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the Democratic primary field is still evolving, but it's uncertain whether the competition will be intense enough to lead to a brokered convention.

(a) Team USA winning gold medals in both Men's and Women's 5v5 basketball at the Paris Olympics: The United States has traditionally been very strong in basketball, with a long history of success in both men's and women's competitions at the Olympics. However, the competition has become increasingly fierce, especially from countries like China, Spain, and Australia. Assuming no significant changes in team dynamics or unexpected events, it's reasonable to estimate the likelihood of the US winning gold in both categories as follows: Men's basketball: 60% (due to strong competition from other nations), Women's basketball: 70% (the US women's team has been particularly dominant). (b) A terrorist attack occurring in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics: France has faced several terrorist attacks in recent years, but the country has also significantly increased its security measures, especially during major events like the Olympics. The likelihood of a terrorist attack is difficult to predict, but given the increased security and the fact that the Olympics are a high-profile target, it's reasonable to estimate the likelihood of an attack as follows: 20% (acknowledging the risk but also considering the enhanced security). (c) The athlete with the highest number of 2024 Olympic gold medals competing in the swimming events: Swimming has consistently produced athletes who win multiple gold medals at the Olympics, with stars like Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky in recent years. Given the depth of talent in swimming and the fact that many top swimmers compete in multiple events, it's reasonable to estimate the likelihood of the top gold medal winner being a swimmer as follows: 80% (considering the historical trend and the current talent pool). To calculate the overall probability of all three conditions being met, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.6 (Men's basketball) \u00d7 0.7 (Women's basketball) \u00d7 0.2 (terrorist attack) \u00d7 0.8 (top gold medal winner in swimming) = 0.0672. However, this calculation assumes independence between the events, which might not be the case (e.g., a terrorist attack could potentially impact the Olympics and, by extension, the performance of athletes). Considering potential dependencies and the complexity of these events, it's prudent to adjust the final probability downward to reflect the uncertainty and interconnectedness of these factors.

Tucker Carlson's Candidacy: As of my last update, Tucker Carlson, a political commentator and television host, has not officially announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. His potential candidacy is speculative at this point. 3. Nomination Process: The Republican National Convention selects the nominee through a process that involves delegates from each state. The outcome can be unpredictable and influenced by numerous factors, including the candidates' performance in primaries and caucuses, their ability to secure delegate support, and the convention's rules and dynamics. 4. Competition: The Republican field for the 2024 nomination is expected to be crowded, with several well-known candidates likely to compete. This competition makes it challenging for any single candidate, including Tucker Carlson if he were to run, to secure the nomination. 5.

While not a hard rule, this precedent could affect Carlson's chances, given his background as a political commentator rather than a politician.

Firstly, while Tucker Carlson is a well-known and influential figure in the Republican Party, it is still uncertain whether he will be selected as the nominee.

Secondly, even if Carlson were to become the nominee, it is unclear what impact this would have on President Biden's ability to the powers and discharge duties of his office. The 25th Amendment Section 4 is a serious measure that is typically only invoked in cases of severe incapacitation, such as a serious illness or injury.

Firstly, the barring of Russian athletes from the 2024 Olympics is a geopolitical event that, while significant, may not have a direct impact on Biden's decision regarding his candidacy. The probability of this event occurring is difficult to estimate without current information on the geopolitical climate closer to the Olympics. However, for the sake of this estimation, let's assume it has a moderate to high probability due to ongoing tensions, but its direct influence on Biden's decision is low. Secondly, Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment before August significantly impacts his ability to run for office. If this happens, it's highly likely that he would not be able to continue his candidacy, as the declaration of incapacity would raise serious questions about his fitness to serve another term. This condition, if it occurs, would make it highly probable that Biden would announce he will not accept the nomination. Given these considerations, the probability that Biden announces he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024, hinges more on the second condition (Biden's incapacitation) than the first (Russian athletes being barred from the Olympics). The incapacitation would likely lead to a swift decision regarding his candidacy due to the constitutional implications and the practical realities of campaigning and governing. However, since the incapacitation is a prerequisite for a high probability of Biden not seeking the nomination, and this is a significant and unpredictable event, the overall probability remains uncertain. Given the information available and the complexities involved, a precise probability is challenging to determine. But considering the potential impact of incapacitation on Biden's candidacy, a moderate to high probability seems reasonable."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "d1f11ab7-23ef-4eb1-b9f6-d25cedb3cb02", "title": "Will Russian athletes be barred from the 2024 Olympics, Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment before August, and Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if ALL of the following occur:\n\n(a) Russian athletes are barred from competing at the 2024 Olympics under either (i) the Russian flag, (ii) The Russian Olympic Committee's flag, or (iii) any other independent or neutral flag.

(a) The linked market will get at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, 2023. Reasoning: This prediction market is about the number of traders in a specific market on Manifold Markets. Without access to real-time data on the market's current number of traders or its growth rate, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction. However, given the specificity of the target (377 traders) and the time frame (by the end of July 15, 2023), and without additional context on how many traders are currently in the market or the market's growth trends, I must rely on general principles.

Reasoning: Predicting election outcomes, especially over a year in advance, is highly speculative. The BJP has been a dominant force in Indian politics, but elections are inherently unpredictable due to various factors like alliances, local issues, and national sentiment.

Probability: 0.55 (c) The ID political group will hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliament elections. Reasoning: Similar to predicting national election outcomes, forecasting the results of European Parliament elections is challenging due to the diverse political landscape across Europe. The Identity and Democracy (ID) group has been growing in influence, but European elections are subject to a wide array of factors including national political shifts, turnout, and coalition dynamics. Without current polling data or a detailed analysis of political trends across the EU, this is a difficult prediction to make accurately.

Firstly, the outcome of the Indian general election is uncertain and depends on various factors such as the performance of the incumbent government, the opposition's campaign, and voter sentiment. However, this event is unrelated to the performance of athletes at the Olympics.

First, let's analyze the two conditions. Condition (a) is related to the outcome of the Indian general election, which is a political event. Condition (b) is related to the performance of athletes in the 100m dash event at the Paris Summer Olympics, which is a sporting event. Neither of these conditions has a direct causal link to the occurrence of a terrorist act in metropolitan France. However, we can consider some indirect factors. The occurrence of a terrorist act in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics could be influenced by various factors such as the security measures in place, the political climate in France, and the global geopolitical situation. While the INC forming the government in India might have some impact on global politics, it is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on the security situation in France. Similarly, the performance of athletes in the 100m dash event is unlikely to have any impact on the security situation in France. Given these considerations, we can conclude that the two conditions (a) and (b) are largely unrelated to the occurrence of a terrorist act in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics. Therefore, we should not update our prior probability of a terrorist act occurring based on these conditions. The prior probability of a terrorist act occurring in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics is difficult to estimate, as it depends on various factors such as the effectiveness of security measures, the political climate, and the global geopolitical situation. However, we can consider some historical data and expert assessments to inform our estimate. According to the Global Terrorism Database, the average annual number of terrorist attacks in France has been around 10-20 in recent years. However, the Olympics are a high-profile event that attracts a large number of people, which could increase the risk of a terrorist attack.

Given the increasing global participation and competitiveness in the Olympics, it's reasonable to expect that at least 5 countries will achieve this milestone in 2024. This condition seems likely, but not guaranteed. Condition 2: The same nation wins more than one women's team sport - There are 8 team sports, and while it's possible for a single nation to dominate multiple sports, it's not a guarantee. In recent Olympics, the United States, China, and other powerhouses have shown strength in multiple team sports. However, the competition is fierce, and upsets can occur. This condition is plausible but not extremely likely. Condition 3: Kalenjin athletes win both the men's and women's marathon races - Kalenjin athletes have a strong tradition of excellence in distance running, particularly in Kenya. However, the Olympics are a high-level competition, and other nations, like Ethiopia, Japan, and the United States, also have talented distance runners. While it's possible for Kalenjin athletes to win both marathons, it's not a certainty.

To assess this, let's consider a few factors. Firstly, the stock market is influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic indicators, company performance, industry trends, and broader geopolitical events. While a major political event like Biden dropping out could potentially impact the market, its effect on a specific stock like Nvidia would likely be indirect and depend on various other factors. Nvidia is a technology company, and its stock price is more closely tied to the performance of the tech industry, the company's financials, and the overall state of the economy. Unless Biden's dropout has a significant and direct impact on the tech industry or the economy as a whole, it's unlikely to have a major effect on Nvidia's stock price. Additionally, the stock market is known for its ability to quickly absorb and respond to new information. If Biden were to drop out, the initial market reaction might be significant, but it's likely that the impact would be short-lived, and the market would quickly adjust to the new information. Given these considerations, it's difficult to predict with certainty how Nvidia's stock price would react to Biden dropping out. However, it's worth noting that Nvidia's stock price has been relatively stable in recent months, and the company has a strong track record of financial performance.

Condition 1: Joe Biden Announces He Will Not Accept the Democratic Nomination by July 15, 2024 - As of my last update in early July 2024, there was no significant indication from Joe Biden or his campaign that he intended to withdraw from the race. Given the political landscape and Biden's previous statements, it seems unlikely he would announce his withdrawal before the nomination process concludes, especially without a major, unforeseen event occurring. Probability: 0.05 (5%). Condition 2: The US Core CPI Increases by More Than 0.1% in July 2024 - Economic forecasting is inherently uncertain, but as of early July 2024, inflation trends had shown some signs of stabilization or slight decreases in certain metrics. However, the Core CPI can be volatile, and small increases are common. Given historical data, an increase of more than 0.1% is plausible but not guaranteed. Probability: 0.6 (60%). Condition 3: 10 or More Democratic Senators Call for Biden to Drop Out Before July 20, 2024 - As of early July 2024, there was no widespread movement among Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out. Such a call would typically be a response to significant political or personal issues affecting Biden's electability or fitness for office. Without a major scandal or drastic change in political fortunes, this seems unlikely. Probability: 0.1 (10%). Combined Probability = Condition 1 Probability \u00d7 Condition 2 Probability \u00d7 Condition 3 Probability = 0.05 \u00d7 0.6 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.003. Therefore, the estimated probability of all three conditions being met is 0.003, or 0.3%. The occurrence of all three specified events seems highly unlikely given current trends and information.

This is a difficult event to predict, as it depends on various factors such as the athletes' form, the course, and any potential crashes or incidents.

(a) Mathieu van der Poel finishes ahead of Wout van Aert in the Men's Olympic Road Race: Both Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert are top-tier cyclists, and their performance can be affected by various factors such as form, strategy, and luck. However, based on their past performances and current form, it's difficult to give a clear edge to either of them. Van der Poel has shown incredible skills in various disciplines, including road racing, while Van Aert has consistently performed well in high-pressure events. Given the uncertainty and the fact that both cyclists are evenly matched, I'd estimate the probability of Van der Poel finishing ahead of Van Aert as around 0.5 (50%).

However, the UEFA Champions League is an extremely competitive tournament, and many factors can influence the outcome, such as team dynamics, injuries, and luck. While PSG has a good chance of winning the tournament, it's difficult to estimate their chances with high confidence. I'd estimate the probability of PSG winning the Champions League as around 0.2 (20%).

However, considering the historical context of presidential elections and the typical polling fluctuations, I'd estimate the probability of Trump's lead being between 2 and 3 points on a specific date (July 15, 2024) to be relatively low, around 0.15. This is because polling leads can fluctuate significantly over time, and a specific range on a specific date is a narrow target.\n\n(b) US hospitalization peak within four weeks of the combined peak for COVID, influenza, and RSV in the 2023-24 season: This event is also uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as the severity of the upcoming flu season, the effectiveness of vaccines, and the spread of COVID-19 and RSV. However, considering the typical patterns of respiratory virus seasons, I'd estimate the probability of the US hospitalization peak occurring within four weeks of the combined peak for COVID, influenza, and RSV to be around 0.4. This is because the peak hospitalization rates for these viruses often coincide or occur within a relatively short period.\n\n(c) Ron DeSantis as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: This event is highly uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as DeSantis's performance in the primaries, the preferences of Republican voters, and the potential entry of other strong candidates.

However, the opposition parties, particularly the Indian National Congress, have been trying to regroup and strengthen their base.

To answer this question, we need to consider the potential impact of the BJP forming the government on the global economy and financial markets. The BJP is a right-wing nationalist party in India, and its economic policies are generally considered to be pro-business and pro-growth. If the BJP forms the government, it is likely to implement policies that promote economic growth, investment, and trade. This could lead to increased economic activity, higher GDP growth, and a stronger Indian rupee. However, the impact of the BJP's policies on the global economy and financial markets is uncertain. The BJP's nationalist agenda could lead to increased tensions with neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan and China, which could negatively impact global trade and economic growth. Additionally, the BJP's policies may not be conducive to foreign investment, which could lead to a decline in foreign capital inflows into India.

To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the number of traders in the market and the volatility index. First, it's important to note that the number of traders in the market is not directly related to the volatility index. The volatility index is a measure of the market's expected volatility, which is influenced by various factors such as economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. However, the fact that the market has at least 377 traders by the end of July 15 could be an indication of increased interest and activity in the market, which could potentially lead to higher volatility. Additionally, the fact that the market has reached this threshold could be seen as a sign of market confidence, which could also contribute to higher volatility. On the other hand, it's also possible that the increased number of traders could lead to more stable market conditions, as more traders can provide more liquidity and reduce price volatility. Given these considerations, it's difficult to make a definitive prediction about the direction of the volatility index.

Condition 1: The linked market gets at least 377 traders by end of July 15, 2023. The market in question is a prediction market on Manifold Markets, and the number of traders can fluctuate over time. As of the creation date (July 1, 2024), the market has already surpassed 377 traders, with over 400 traders participating. Given the existing traction and the fact that the market has already exceeded the required number of traders, it is likely that the market will maintain or increase its current number of traders. Therefore, I estimate the probability of this condition being met as high. Condition 2: The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) is higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024. The VXVCLS index measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 index over a 3-month period. Historical data shows that the VXVCLS index can be volatile and influenced by various market and economic factors. While it is difficult to predict with certainty, I can look at the current trend and historical data. As of the creation date (July 1, 2024), the VXVCLS index is around 15.5, which is relatively low compared to historical levels. However, it is possible that the index could increase over the next year due to various market and economic factors. Given the uncertainty and the fact that the index can be influenced by many factors, I estimate the probability of this condition being met as moderate. Condition 3: Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President. This condition is highly uncertain and dependent on various political factors, including Joe Biden's personal decisions and the political landscape. As of the creation date (July 1, 2024), there is no clear indication that Joe Biden will not seek re-election. While it is possible that he may decide not to run, it is also possible that he will seek re-election. Given the uncertainty and the fact that this is a political decision, I estimate the probability of this condition being met as low. Combining the probabilities: To estimate the overall probability of all three conditions being met, I'll multiply the individual probabilities. Assuming the probabilities are independent, the combined probability is: Probability (Condition 1) \u00d7 Probability (Condition 2) \u00d7 Probability (Condition 3) = 0.9 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.2 = 0.09. The combined probability is relatively low due to the uncertainty surrounding Condition 3 and the moderate probability of Condition 2.

Without more information about the current state of the primary race, it's difficult to estimate his chances accurately. However, given the crowded field and the unpredictability of primary elections, I would estimate his chances at around 0.1.

First, let's analyze the conditions. The first condition, the USA winning more Gold than Silver medals, is a sporting event outcome that is difficult to predict with certainty. However, historically, the USA has consistently performed well in the Olympics, and it's possible that they might win more Gold than Silver medals. Let's assign a rough probability of 0.4 to this event. The second condition, Donald Trump being the Republican nominee, is a political event that is also difficult to predict with certainty. However, given Trump's popularity among Republican voters and his previous nomination in 2016, it's possible that he might be nominated again. Let's assign a rough probability of 0.3 to this event. Now, let's assume that both conditions are met, and we need to estimate the probability of Russia controlling Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024. Chasiv Yar is a city in Ukraine, and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia is ongoing.

Component 1: Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President AND Asa Hutchinson is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Joe Biden's Announcement: Given the current political landscape and the fact that Joe Biden has expressed interest in running for re-election, it seems unlikely that he would announce not accepting the nomination before July 15, 2024. However, political decisions can be unpredictable, and there's always a possibility of health issues, political pressure, or unforeseen events that could change his stance. Still, based on current information, this seems less likely. Asa Hutchinson's Nomination: Asa Hutchinson's path to the Republican nomination is challenging, given the current field of potential candidates and the political dynamics within the Republican Party. While he has expressed interest in running, the nomination process is highly competitive and unpredictable. Thus, this component also seems less likely. Given these considerations, the combined probability of both events in Component 1 occurring seems low, likely less than 10%. Component 2: Kamala Harris is formally designated as President or Acting President of the United States before July 26, 2024. This component is highly dependent on unforeseen events such as the incapacitation or resignation of President Biden, which are difficult to predict with any certainty. Given the current health and political status of President Biden and Vice President Harris, this scenario, while possible, is also considered low probability, likely less than 10%. Combining the Probabilities: To find the combined probability of both components resolving as YES, we multiply the probabilities of each component. Assuming a conservative estimate of 5% for each component (to account for the unpredictability of political events), the combined probability would be 5% * 5% = 0.25%. Reasoning: The question requires both a highly unlikely political announcement from Joe Biden and a specific outcome in the Republican nomination process, combined with an unforeseen event leading to Kamala Harris becoming President or Acting President. Each component is individually unlikely, and their combination makes the overall scenario very improbable."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 5.489238628670267e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 1.3723096571675668e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.012628696715027988, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, this rate can vary significantly from year to year, and it's influenced by various factors, such as the number of participating countries, the voting system, and the quality of the performances.

Therefore, the information about countries winning their first Olympic medals does not provide any insight into how Manifold respondents will vote in the two polls. Additionally, the difference in vote share between Trump facing Joe Biden and a generic Democrat is more likely to be influenced by factors such as the respondents' perceptions of Biden versus a generic Democrat, rather than unrelated events like the Olympics. Given the lack of connection between the two events, the probability of Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat is independent of the outcome of the Olympic Games. Therefore, the probability is based solely on the underlying preferences of Manifold respondents and the specifics of the two polls, which are not provided. However, without additional information about the polls and the preferences of Manifold respondents, it is challenging to estimate the exact probability.

First, it is essential to recognize that the box office performance of 'Trap' and the USA's Olympic medal count are unrelated to the presidential election process. The outcome of the presidential election is determined by a complex array of factors, including candidate popularity, party politics, and voter sentiment.

While it is possible that he could still enter the race, his chances of winning the nomination are low.

Firstly, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's candidacy approval might lead to increased tensions between Iran and Israel, as Ahmadinejad has been known for his anti-Israeli rhetoric in the past. However, it is essential to note that the Iranian presidential election is scheduled for June 2024, and the outcome is uncertain. Even if Ahmadinejad is elected, it is unclear whether he would immediately pursue military action against Israel. Secondly, Democratic pressure on Biden to end his re-election campaign is unlikely to have a direct impact on Iran's decision to initiate military action against Israel. The US presidential election is a domestic issue, and it is unlikely to influence Iran's foreign policy decisions directly. Considering these factors, the probability of Iran initiating military action on Israel by August 13th seems low.

Condition 1: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's inclusion in Iran's Guardian Council's list of qualified presidential candidates. Given Ahmadinejad's history and influence in Iranian politics, it's possible that he might be included in the list. However, the Guardian Council has previously disqualified him from running in 2017, citing his age and other factors. Considering this, the likelihood of his inclusion is uncertain but not extremely low. Let's assign a probability of 0.4 to this condition. Condition 2: A group of at least five named Democratic Party US House Members or US Senators pressuring Biden to drop out before July 20th. Given the current political climate and the fact that Biden has already announced his re-election campaign, it's unlikely that a group of Democrats would publicly call for him to drop out. However, it's not impossible, especially if there are significant concerns about his campaign or health. Let's assign a probability of 0.2 to this condition. Condition 3: Iran initiating a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory between July 30 and August 12, 2024. Given the historical tensions between Iran and Israel, as well as recent escalations in the region, this condition is not entirely implausible. However, it's still a relatively unlikely event, especially considering the potential consequences of such an action. Let's assign a probability of 0.3 to this condition. To calculate the overall probability of all three conditions being met, we need to multiply the individual probabilities together.

This event does not directly impact Joe Biden's presidency unless it leads to a broader impeachment or resignation scenario involving Biden, which is highly unlikely given the available information. The charging of Donald Trump would likely be an isolated event with no direct bearing on Joe Biden's presidency. Given the lack of a direct causal link between the charging of Donald Trump and the potential removal of Joe Biden from office, we should focus on the overall stability of the Biden presidency. As of the knowledge cutoff date (01 Dec 2023), there is no credible information suggesting that Joe Biden would be removed from office or resign by the end of July 2024. However, there are general risks associated with the presidency, such as impeachment, resignation, or incapacitation due to health issues. These risks are difficult to quantify but are generally low.

Both Drake and Kendrick Lamar are prominent figures in the hip-hop industry, known for their lyrical prowess and past feuds with other artists.

This event is likely to be a significant milestone in the tech industry, potentially indicating a shift in the balance of power between these two giants. However, it's unclear how this event would directly influence OpenAI's commitment to the principle in question. OpenAI's commitment to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle is more closely related to the company's values, culture, and relationships with its stakeholders, including researchers, developers, and users. The principle is also closely tied to the righttowarn.ai statement, which emphasizes the importance of open criticism and transparency in AI development. Given the lack of a clear causal link between Nvidia's market cap and OpenAI's commitment to the principle, it's difficult to argue that the condition would have a significant impact on OpenAI's decision. OpenAI's commitment to the principle would likely depend on internal factors, such as the company's values and culture, as well as external factors, such as pressure from stakeholders and the broader AI community.

Firstly, the number of traders in the linked market is not directly related to the likelihood of an attack on the Crimean Bridge. Therefore, we can disregard this condition for our estimation. Secondly, Nikki Haley becoming the Republican nominee might have some implications for US foreign policy, but it is unclear how this would directly impact the likelihood of an attack on the Crimean Bridge. Without more information on Haley's stance on Russia-Ukraine relations and potential military interventions, we cannot make a strong connection between her nomination and the probability of an attack. Lastly, we need to consider the general geopolitical tensions and the history of conflicts in the region. The Crimean Bridge, connecting Russia to Crimea, has been a point of contention since its construction. There have been reports of Ukrainian forces targeting the bridge in the past, and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine increases the likelihood of such incidents. However, without specific information on current military operations, intelligence on potential attacks, or statements from involved parties indicating an increased likelihood of an attack, we cannot assign a high probability to this event.

(a) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by end of July 15: Without access to real-time market data or historical trends for this specific market, it's challenging to provide a precise estimate. However, considering the requirement is for at least 377 traders, which is a relatively low number for an active market, and given that the market has until July 15 to reach this threshold, this condition seems feasible but not guaranteed. Let's assign a moderate to high probability to this event, around 0.7, acknowledging the uncertainty. (b) Nikki Haley becomes the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Predicting political outcomes, especially more than a year in advance, is notoriously difficult due to the fluid nature of political landscapes. Nikki Haley is a well-known figure within the Republican Party, but the path to becoming the nominee involves many variables, including the preferences of delegates and the strategies of other candidates. Given these uncertainties, the probability of Nikki Haley becoming the nominee is difficult to estimate precisely but is likely less than 0.5, considering the competition and unpredictability of political races. (c) The Crimean Bridge is hit with an attack before July 1, 2024: This event's probability is hard to assess without current geopolitical tensions and specific threat levels. However, given the strategic importance of the Crimean Bridge and ongoing conflicts in the region, there is a plausible risk of such an event. Assigning a probability to this is challenging, but it seems less likely than the first event and possibly less predictable than political outcomes. Let's estimate this around 0.3, acknowledging the uncertainty and the specific timeframe. To find the combined probability of all these independent events happening, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.7 (market event) * 0.4 (Nikki Haley nomination, adjusted downward for conservatism) * 0.3 (Crimean Bridge attack) = 0.084. The calculation above considers each event's estimated probability, acknowledging the high uncertainty in each, especially in political and geopolitical outcomes.

The semi-finals can be unpredictable, and even strong countries can fail to qualify if their entry doesn't connect with the audience or if they face stiff competition in their semi-final.

While the problem statement does not provide information about Israel's chances of qualifying, we can make an educated guess based on Israel's past performance in the Eurovision contest. Israel has a relatively strong track record, having qualified for the Grand Final in most years since the introduction of the semi-final system in 2004. However, qualification is never guaranteed, and we should assign a probability of around 0.6-0.7 to Israel qualifying. The second part of the problem is more challenging, as it depends on various factors such as the performance of the candidates, the state of the US economy, and other events that may influence public opinion. However, we can make an educated guess based on the current state of the 2024 US presidential election. As of the knowledge cutoff in 2023, the election is still over a year away, and the polling landscape is likely to change significantly before then. However, we can look at the historical trends in polling averages and the typical margins between candidates in the months leading up to a presidential election. In general, polling averages tend to be volatile, and margins between candidates can fluctuate significantly over time. Given this volatility, it's difficult to predict with certainty what the polling average will be on a specific date. However, we can assign a rough probability distribution to the possible outcomes. Assuming that the polling average on July 15, 2024, will be roughly normally distributed around a mean of 0 (i.e., a tied election), we can estimate the probability of Trump's lead being between 3 and 4 points. This corresponds to a relatively narrow range of outcomes, and the probability is likely to be low. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of Trump's lead being between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, conditional on Israel qualifying for the Grand Final, to be around 0.05-0.1. However, since the question is conditional on Israel qualifying, we need to multiply this probability by the probability of Israel qualifying, which we estimated to be around 0.65.

Given the current state of relations, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place. However, we can consider some factors that may influence the likelihood of such events: 1. Recent tensions: There have been recent reports of increased tensions between the Philippines and China, particularly over the South China Sea dispute. This could potentially lead to diplomatic expulsions or recalls. 2. Diplomatic efforts: Despite tensions, both countries have made efforts to maintain diplomatic relations and engage in dialogue. This could reduce the likelihood of expulsions or recalls. 3. Regional dynamics: The Philippines is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has been actively engaged in promoting regional stability and cooperation. This could provide a framework for resolving disputes peacefully. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before August 1, 2024, as follows:"}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "c3749808-5726-45c5-88bf-392d47df5667", "title": "If diplomatic expulsions or recalls take place between the Philippines and China before August 1, 2024, will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Before August 1, 2024, one of these four events happens, according to official statements or credible reports: \n\n- The Philippines expels at least one diplomat representing the People's Republic of China (PRC). \n\n- The Philippines recalls at least one of its diplomats stationed in the PRC.\n\n- The PRC expels at least one diplomat representing the Philippines.\n\n- The PRC recalls at least one of its diplomats stationed in the Philippines. \n\nThen, will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nResolution criteria for the outcome: Resolves as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.

It is unlikely that diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China would have a direct impact on Joe Biden's decision to run for president.

The two events seem unrelated - the achievement of weak AGI, as perceived by Manifold respondents, does not have a clear connection to the IMDB rating of a TV show episode. The rating of a TV show episode is typically influenced by factors such as the quality of the writing, acting, direction, and audience expectations, rather than the achievement of a technological milestone like weak AGI. Therefore, the probability of the episode being rated >8.5 on IMDB is likely independent of the Manifold poll results. However, since the question is conditional on the Manifold poll results, we must consider the possibility that the respondents who believe weak AGI has been achieved may also have some influence on the IMDB rating, perhaps due to their demographics or interests. Nevertheless, this connection is likely to be weak, and the influence of this group on the overall IMDB rating is likely to be small. Given the lack of a clear connection between the two events, the best approach is to rely on our prior expectations about the IMDB rating of a TV show episode. A rating of >8.5 is relatively high, but not unusually so for a popular show like 'House of the Dragon'. Therefore, our prior expectation might be around 20-30% that the episode will receive such a high rating. However, since the question is conditional on the Manifold poll results, we should adjust our prior expectation slightly downwards, to reflect the possibility that the respondents who believe weak AGI has been achieved may not have a significant influence on the IMDB rating.

Nvidia, on the other hand, is a leading company in the field of graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) computing, with a market capitalization of around $1 trillion USD. While Nvidia has been growing rapidly in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for its GPUs and AI-related products, it is still significantly smaller than Apple in terms of market capitalization. To surpass Apple's market capitalization, Nvidia would need to experience an extraordinary growth spurt or Apple would need to experience a significant decline in value. There are a few potential factors that could contribute to Nvidia's growth, such as the increasing adoption of AI and machine learning technologies, the growing demand for cloud computing and datacenter infrastructure, and the potential for Nvidia to expand its product offerings into new areas.

(a) Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President: As of the current date (June 4, 2024), Joe Biden has not made any public statements indicating he will not seek re-election. In fact, he has already announced his intention to run for re-election. Given the proximity of the deadline (July 15, 2024), it's unlikely that Biden will suddenly change his mind and announce he won't accept the nomination. Additionally, the Democratic Party has already begun preparations for the 2024 convention, assuming Biden will be the nominee. Probability: 0.05. (b) OpenAI publicly commits to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle before July 1, 2024: OpenAI has not made any public statements about adopting this principle, and there is no indication that they plan to do so.

To assess the probability of this event, we need to consider the potential impact of these conditions on the stock market and the volatility index. Condition (a) is a significant event that could lead to increased market volatility, as it involves a violent act against a high-profile individual. This could lead to a short-term increase in market uncertainty and fear, which could drive up the volatility index. Condition (b) is less directly related to the stock market, but it could potentially have an impact on global stability and economic conditions. The arrival of Kenyan military or police personnel in Haiti could be seen as a stabilizing factor, but it could also lead to increased tensions or conflicts in the region, which could have a negative impact on global markets. However, it's essential to note that the stock market is subject to many factors and influences, and the impact of these two conditions on the volatility index is uncertain. The market may already be pricing in the potential risks and uncertainties associated with these events, or other factors may dominate the market's attention.

However, without access to real-time market data or the ability to browse the internet, I'll rely on general knowledge and reasoning. The BSE SENSEX is a widely followed stock market index in India, and its value can fluctuate based on various economic and market factors. As of my knowledge cutoff, I don't have information on the current market trends or the BSE SENSEX's current value. However, I can make an educated guess based on general market behavior. Historically, the BSE SENSEX has shown significant volatility, with values ranging from around 20,000 to over 60,000 in the past decade. Given this volatility, it's challenging to predict the exact value of the index on a specific date. However, I can assume that the index will continue to fluctuate within a reasonable range. Assuming a relatively stable market, I'll consider a range of possible values for the BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024. Based on historical trends, it's possible that the index could be within the range of 70,000 to 80,000. Within this range, the probability of the index being greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k seems plausible.

The Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions are separate and distinct geopolitical spheres, with different key players and interests. While the attack by Iran within Israel could potentially lead to a broader conflict in the Middle East, it's not directly related to the tensions between China and Taiwan.
