This would mark the biggest opening weekend ever for an R-rated movie. Domestically, the film is expected to debut with $160 million to $170 million, making it the biggest R-rated opening of all-time.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n[image]The record for biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie is the original Deadpool at $284.5M ($152.2M domestic).\n\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/box-office-deadpool-makes-history-865143/\n\n[image]\nWill the new movie top these marks? It will probably be close...\n\nIt will certainly play at more theaters... Deadpool was a smash hit at the time, and a bit surprising.\n\nSince BoxOfficeMojo is a bit weird on reporting international opening weekends -- it provides the raw numbers but aggregates them weirdly -- we will wait for Hollywood Reporter to let us know what the weekend opening was.\n\nTo clarify on resolution...\n-> this market will resolve YES if Deadpool x Wolverine grosses more than $284.5M globally this opening weekend according to reports\n-> AND the Hollywood Reporter (or equivalent publication) reports it as the record for an R-rated movie release\n\nIn other words the BoxOfficeMojo numbers should be seen as unofficial until there's confirmation in the Hollywood press.
