This provision has been discussed in relation to Donald Trump, especially following the events of January 6, 2021. However, the application of this section to block Trump from a primary election ballot would require a legal determination that he engaged in such acts, which is a complex and unprecedented legal challenge.\n\nSeveral factors need to be considered:\n\n1. Legal Precedent and Interpretation: There is limited precedent for applying Section 3 of the 14th Amendment in modern times, particularly concerning election ballots. The interpretation of what constitutes \"insurrection or rebellion\" and whether Trump's actions meet this criterion would likely be contested in court.\n\n2. State Actions and Legal Challenges: For Trump to be removed from a ballot, a state would have to take action to enforce Section 3, which would likely lead to significant legal battles. These would involve state election officials, courts, and possibly the federal judiciary. The timeline for such legal proceedings could be extensive and may not be resolved by July 15, 2024.\n\n3. Political and Public Pressure: There would be significant political and public pressure both for and against such a move, which could influence state actions and court decisions. The political landscape is highly polarized, and actions against Trump could be seen as politically motivated, complicating the legal process.\n\n4.

The novelty and complexity of the legal arguments involved could delay any definitive action.\n\nGiven these considerations, while there is a non-zero probability that some states might attempt to remove Trump from the ballot under Section 3, the combination of legal, political, and procedural hurdles makes it unlikely that such an action would be successfully completed and remain in effect by the specified date."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "443f0431-a01e-40bc-92ba-1e4945884e83", "title": "Given Donald Trump is removed from any primary ballot under the 14th Amendment, will Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, as confirmed by official state government announcements, court decisions, legal documentation, or credible media reports, by July 15, 2024.

For condition (b), President Biden has been actively preparing for the 2024 election, and there have been no significant indicators suggesting he would voluntarily step down. The decision to not seek re-election would be unprecedented for a sitting president without clear and compelling reasons.

Newer countries have emerged as strong competitors, and the competition has become more diverse and unpredictable. 4. **Semi-final Structure**: The qualification largely depends on the semi-final draw and the strength of the competing entries. Both countries will need to stand out in their respective semi-finals to secure a spot in the Grand Final. 5. **Public and Jury Voting**: Success in Eurovision requires appealing to both the public and the juries. Ireland and Luxembourg will need entries that can capture attention and votes across Europe. Considering these factors, while both countries have the potential to qualify, the uncertainties and challenges make it less likely that both will qualify simultaneously. Ireland's recent struggles and Luxembourg's long absence add to the uncertainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.031644612134445915, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.010548204044815305, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2993032670642441, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Israel has previously conducted covert operations and airstrikes against Iranian targets, primarily in Syria, but also reportedly within Iran itself. 2. Recent Developments: As of April 2024, there may be increased regional tensions, possibly related to Iran's nuclear activities or geopolitical shifts. However, any recent developments in April 2024 are beyond my knowledge cut-off, which is October 2023. 3. Political and Military Considerations: Israel's decision to conduct an attack would likely depend on its assessment of the threat posed by Iran, as well as the potential international repercussions. Israel has a history of acting unilaterally to protect its national security interests, but it also weighs the potential diplomatic fallout. 4. Timing and Operational Feasibility: With the question being asked on April 13, 2024, there is a limited window of less than three weeks for such an attack to occur. This short timeframe reduces the likelihood, as significant military operations typically require planning and coordination. 5. Credibility of Reports: For the question to resolve as \"Yes,\" there must be credible reports attributing the attack to Israel. This adds another layer of complexity, as covert operations may not always be immediately or conclusively attributed.

The likelihood of him securing the nomination is uncertain and depends on various political dynamics within the Republican Party. However, for the sake of this conditional probability, we assume he is the nominee.\n\n2. **Rishi Sunak's Political Position**: Rishi Sunak is the Prime Minister of the UK and a prominent member of the Conservative Party. As of now, he holds a significant political position and is expected to contest in his current seat or another safe Conservative seat. The probability of him losing his seat, given the current political landscape, is relatively low. However, political dynamics can change rapidly, and factors such as party popularity, national issues, and local constituency matters can influence election outcomes.\n\n3. **Independence of Events**: The condition that Vivek Ramaswamy is the Republican nominee for the US Presidential Election is largely independent of Rishi Sunak's electoral prospects in the UK. There is no direct causal link between the two events, meaning Ramaswamy's nomination is unlikely to have a significant impact on Sunak's election prospects.\n\n4. **UK Political Context**: The Conservative Party's popularity, Sunak's performance as Prime Minister, and national issues leading up to the election will be more critical factors influencing his re-election chances. If the Conservative Party maintains a strong position, Sunak's chances of being re-elected remain high.\n\nConsidering these factors, while political surprises can occur, the probability of Rishi Sunak failing to be elected as an MP, conditional on Ramaswamy being the Republican nominee, seems low due to the independence of the events and Sunak's current political standing."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "8033a088-5728-42df-9770-4407ef6d574f", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Vivek Ramaswamy be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election and (b) Rishi Sunak fail to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Vivek Ramaswamy is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (2) Rishi Sunak fails to be elected as a Member of Parliament in the July 4 2024 UK general election. \n\nFor condition (1), it is not relevant who receives the Republican nomination on the day of the 2024 US election; it is solely determined by who is selected by the delegates of the [Republican National Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention).\n\nFor condition (2), the question resolves as **Yes** if for any reason Rishi Sunak fails to be elected as a Member of Parliament in the July 4 2024 UK general election.

However, as of the latest information available up to October 2023, he is not a leading candidate in the Republican field. The primary contenders for the nomination are typically more established politicians with significant political experience or name recognition, such as Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis. Given the historical trends and current polling data, it is unlikely that Ramaswamy will secure the nomination.\n\n2. **Rishi Sunak Failing to be Elected as an MP:**\n   - Rishi Sunak is the current Prime Minister of the UK and a member of the Conservative Party. As an incumbent Prime Minister, he is expected to run for re-election in his constituency. Historically, sitting Prime Ministers have a strong likelihood of winning their parliamentary seats unless there is a significant political upheaval.

If Manifold respondents view Biden negatively compared to a generic Democrat, Trump could potentially gain more support when Biden is named.\n\n3. **Historical Polling Data**: The body text suggests that public opinion polls show Biden performing worse against Trump than other Democrats. If Manifold respondents follow this trend, Trump could indeed see a gain of at least 3% against Biden compared to a generic Democrat.\n\n4. **Poll Design and Options**: The specific design of the polls, including how questions are phrased and what options are available, can influence outcomes.

If Biden is currently facing criticism or Trump has gained popularity, this could increase the likelihood of Trump gaining more support against Biden.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a reasonable chance that Trump could gain at least 3% more support when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat, the outcome is not certain due to the potential biases and unique characteristics of the Manifold polling audience."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "34c74b83-27ed-4aad-9698-28ec664d125f", "title": "Given Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat, will USD be worth >= 145 JPY at close on August 9th, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents.

Polling Shift: The first part of the question states that Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat. This is a hypothetical scenario and whether it occurs depends on the perceptions of the respondents. However, the outcome of this poll is not directly linked to economic indicators or currency exchange rates. 2.

The exchange rate is highly volatile and can be affected by numerous unpredictable factors. 3. Market Influence: Even if Trump gains in the polls, the impact on the USD/JPY exchange rate by August 9th, 2024, would be speculative. Political events, such as elections, can influence market sentiment, but the direct impact on exchange rates is complex and multifaceted.

Historically, Biden has been perceived as a weaker candidate compared to a generic Democrat, as reflected in many public opinion polls. These polls suggest that Biden often polls worse against Trump than a generic Democrat does. Given that Manifold respondents might reflect broader public sentiment, it is plausible that Trump could gain at least 3% more support against Biden than against a generic Democrat.

The exchange rate has fluctuated significantly in recent years. The Bank of Japan's monetary policy, along with the Federal Reserve's actions, will heavily influence this rate. Assuming current trends continue, there is a reasonable chance that the USD could reach or exceed 145 JPY, especially if the US maintains higher interest rates compared to Japan. However, currency markets are notoriously volatile, and unforeseen events could easily shift this balance.

Song and Performance Quality: The quality of Croatia's song and performance for the 2024 contest is crucial. A well-received entry with popular appeal or critical acclaim could increase their chances of qualifying. 3. Semi-final Group: The composition of the semi-final group Croatia is placed in can affect their chances. If the group is particularly competitive with many strong entries, it might be harder for Croatia to qualify. 4. Voting Patterns: Eurovision voting can be influenced by regional and diaspora voting patterns. If Croatia has strong support from neighboring countries or a large diaspora voting bloc, it could improve their chances. 5. Netherlands' Qualification: The qualification of the Netherlands does not directly impact Croatia's chances unless there are specific voting alliances or patterns that benefit both countries. However, such connections are typically not strong enough to significantly alter probabilities. Given these factors, the qualification of the Netherlands does not inherently increase the likelihood of Croatia qualifying.

Croatia, on the other hand, has had a more inconsistent track record, with fewer qualifications in recent years. The qualification depends on factors such as the quality of the song, staging, performance, and the competition they face in their respective semi-finals. Additionally, geopolitical voting patterns and diaspora voting can influence the results, although the Eurovision organizers have been trying to minimize these effects. Assuming both countries participate in the semi-finals, their chances will also depend on the draw (which semi-final they are placed in) and the number of countries competing. Typically, around 10 countries qualify from each semi-final, so if there are 15-20 countries per semi-final, each country has a base probability of around 50-67% to qualify, assuming an equal distribution of quality and popularity among entries.

Red-teaming (hiring external parties to test the robustness and safety of systems) is a common practice in tech, especially for companies dealing with AI. Given the increasing focus on AI safety and regulation, it is plausible that Inflection would engage in such practices and publish a report to demonstrate their commitment to safety.

The BSE SENSEX is a stock market index that reflects the performance of 30 financially sound and established companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The performance of the SENSEX is influenced by a variety of factors including economic conditions, corporate earnings, investor sentiment, and global market trends.\n\n1. **Historical Trends:** Historically, stock indices like the SENSEX exhibit both upward and downward trends based on economic cycles. If the SENSEX has been trending upward in the months leading to July 2024, it might be closer to reaching the 75,000 to 76,000 range.\n\n2. **Current Economic Conditions:** As of my last update in October 2023, global economic conditions were mixed, with some regions experiencing growth while others faced challenges. Inflation rates, interest rates, and economic policies both in India and globally will play a significant role.\n\n3. **Market Volatility:** Stock markets are inherently volatile and predicting the exact closing value on a specific day is challenging. The range of 1,000 points (from 75,000 to 76,000) is relatively narrow, making it statistically less probable for the index to close within this specific range unless it is already trading near these levels.\n\n4. **Recent Performance:** If the SENSEX was already trading near or within this range as of early July 2024, the probability increases. However, without specific data on the current level of the SENSEX, it's difficult to make an accurate prediction.\n\n5. **External Events:** Unforeseen events such as geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or significant policy changes can drastically impact market performance.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it is possible for the SENSEX to close within this specific range, the narrowness of the range and the inherent volatility of the stock market suggest that the probability is relatively low."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "276f26fc-0885-4ef6-98ac-36ca3401533b", "title": "Conditional on BSE SENSEX closing between 75k and 76k on July 21, 2024, will the linked market get at least 377 traders by July 15?", "body": "This question evaluates two conditions:\n\nCondition: On July 21, 2024, the closing value of the BSE SENSEX must be greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 76,000, as reported by Yahoo Finance.\n\nOutcome: Resolves YES if the linked market has at least 377 traders before market close on July 15, 11:59 PM Pacific Time.

The number of traders in a market can be influenced by the market's popularity, marketing efforts, and the perceived potential of the market.

Her involvement, even in a cameo role, could attract additional viewers who might not typically watch superhero movies, potentially boosting box office numbers.\n\n3. **Market Trends**: The box office landscape has changed since 2016 and 2013, with factors like the growth of streaming services and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting theater attendance. However, there has been a resurgence in theater-going as seen with recent blockbusters.\n\n4. **Franchise Appeal**: The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine in a single film could create significant hype, as both characters have distinct and popular personas. This could lead to a strong marketing push and high anticipation among fans.\n\n5. **Competition and Release Timing**: The success of the opening weekend will also depend on the competition from other films released around the same time. If \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" faces little competition, it could have a stronger opening.\n\nConsidering these factors, while Taylor Swift's cameo could indeed draw additional interest, the combined opening target is quite high.

Their recommendations can be influenced by a variety of factors including corporate governance practices, shareholder interests, and public controversies.\n\n1. **Elon Musk's Pay Package**: Elon Musk's $57 billion pay package has been controversial since its inception. It is structured as a series of stock options that vest based on Tesla achieving certain operational milestones. Shareholder advisory firms like ISS may view such large compensation packages critically, especially if they believe it misaligns with shareholder interests or corporate governance best practices.\n\n2. **Kimbal Musk's Re-election**: Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother, is a member of Tesla's board. ISS might advise against his re-election if there are concerns about board independence or potential conflicts of interest. However, unless there have been significant issues related to his performance or governance, ISS might not find sufficient grounds to advise against his re-election.\n\n3. **Historical Context and ISS Trends**: Historically, ISS has not shied away from recommending votes against high-profile figures when corporate governance concerns are significant. However, they also weigh the company's performance and strategic direction.\n\n4. **Current Sentiment and Developments**: As of the latest available data, there have been no major recent controversies specifically involving Kimbal Musk. However, Tesla and Elon Musk often attract scrutiny due to their high-profile nature and Musk's public persona.\n\n5. **Market Condition**: The condition of the market (having 377 traders) is assumed to be met. This does not directly influence ISS's decision, but it is a condition for the resolution of the question.\n\nGiven these considerations, while there is a possibility ISS might advise against the pay package due to its size and structure, the likelihood of them advising against Kimbal Musk's re-election seems lower unless new issues arise.

Unfortunately, without access to the current number of traders or growth trends, this part of the question is difficult to assess accurately.\n\n(b) ISS advising against Elon Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election depends on ISS's assessment of Tesla's governance and compensation practices.

The ICC has been cautious in its approach to issuing such warrants, especially against leaders of countries with strong geopolitical ties. While there have been calls for investigations into actions by Israeli leaders, the likelihood of the ICC issuing arrest warrants by July 1, 2024, remains uncertain and potentially low due to international diplomatic pressures and the complex legal processes involved.\n\n2. **Terrorist Threats in France**: France has been a target for terrorist activities in the past, and the Olympics could be seen as a high-profile event that might attract such threats. However, French authorities are likely to implement extensive security measures to prevent any attacks during the event. The history of terrorism in France, along with the increased security during international events, suggests a non-negligible risk but also a robust counter-terrorism effort.\n\n3. **Connection to ICC Actions**: The issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli leaders might provoke reactions from groups sympathetic to the Palestinian cause or those opposed to Israeli policies. However, the direct link between such a political action and an increased likelihood of a terrorist attack in France is speculative. While it could be a factor, it is not the sole or even primary determinant of terrorist activity.\n\n4. **Overall Probability Assessment**: Given the uncertainty of the ICC issuing warrants and the speculative nature of its impact on terrorist activities in France, the probability of a terrorist attack occurring specifically because of this condition is relatively low.

Historically, it is rare for a tennis player to win more than one medal in a single Olympics, mainly because an athlete would need to compete in multiple events and succeed in all. However, top players who participate in multiple categories (e.g., singles and doubles) do have a chance, especially if they are versatile and part of a strong doubles team. Notable players like Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved this in the past. The probability of this happening depends on the participation and form of top players who are capable of competing in multiple events.\n\n2. **The same nation wins more than one women's team sport**: In women's team sports, nations with strong traditions and investments in sports infrastructure, like the United States, often dominate. The US, for example, has historically been strong in women's basketball, soccer, and volleyball. The probability of a single nation winning more than one of these team sports is relatively high for such nations, especially given their historical performance and depth in these sports.\n\nBoth conditions require specific outcomes, and while each condition on its own might have a reasonable chance of occurring, the combined probability is lower because both must occur simultaneously.

Historically, Iran and Israel have had tense relations, and there have been periods of heightened military activity. However, direct military actions are significant escalations and carry substantial risks for Iran.

This suggests that Chung has the capability to deliver a film that resonates well with critics. The cast includes Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar Jones, both of whom have been involved in successful and well-received projects.

Sequels often face the challenge of living up to or surpassing the original, especially when the original did not have a particularly high score. However, a standalone sequel with a fresh storyline and new creative direction could potentially exceed the original's performance.\n\n3. **Genre and Audience Reception**: Disaster films, like the original \"Twister,\" often have mixed critical receptions due to their reliance on special effects and sometimes formulaic plots.

A summer release might face competition from other blockbusters, which could influence both audience and critical attention.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a positive indication from the director's previous work and the potential for a fresh take on the disaster genre, there are also risks associated with being a sequel and the inherent challenges of the genre.

Azerbaijan has historically benefited from support from neighboring countries. Czechia's voting support is less predictable, but they have managed to garner enough votes to qualify in the past.\n\n4. **Competition**: The strength of other countries in their respective semi-finals will also impact their chances.

There have been instances of covert operations and reported attacks attributed to Israel within Iran in the past, particularly targeting nuclear facilities and personnel. \n\n2. **Current Geopolitical Climate**: As of the latest data, tensions in the Middle East remain high, with ongoing conflicts and proxy wars involving both countries. Any developments in Iran's nuclear capabilities or regional influence could trigger preemptive actions from Israel.\n\n3. **Strategic Interests**: Israel's primary concern is its national security, particularly with regard to Iran's nuclear ambitions. If intelligence suggests an imminent threat or advancement in Iran's nuclear program, Israel might take military action to mitigate the perceived risk.\n\n4. **Timing and Political Context**: The question ties the likelihood of an attack to Trump's polling lead over Biden.

The New Popular Front and Together are significant coalitions, and the current Prime Minister is likely from one of these groups.

Night Shyamalan's Track Record**: Shyamalan's recent films have received mixed CinemaScores: \"Split\" (B+), \"Glass\" (B), \"Old\" (C+), and \"Knock at the Cabin\" (C). This shows a trend where his films have generally received lower audience scores over time.

The director's unique style can be polarizing, leading to varied scores.\n\nGiven these considerations, while there is a possibility of \"Trap\" receiving a B or higher, the mixed recent track record and the absence of a direct link between the conditional event and the film's reception suggest a moderate probability."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "57eff1a2-4f09-484b-9c28-c77089ef26c9", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) \"House of the Dragon\" S2E8 (season finale) be rated >8.5 on IMDB, 2 days after release?

Elon Musk's $57 billion package has been controversial, and ISS has previously advised against similar packages.
