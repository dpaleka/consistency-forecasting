To assess the probability of this record being broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics, we must consider several factors: 1. **Current Athlete Performance**: As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, no athlete has consistently run sub-9.63 seconds in major competitions. The closest performances have been by athletes like Usain Bolt and Christian Coleman, but they have not surpassed the Olympic record. 2. **Technological and Training Advances**: While there have been advancements in training techniques and technology, such as improved track surfaces and running shoes, these have not yet resulted in a significant breakthrough in 100m times that would suggest breaking the record is imminent. 3. **Competition Pressure**: The Olympics often bring out peak performances due to the high stakes. However, breaking a record requires not just peak performance but also optimal conditions, such as favorable weather and wind conditions. 4. **Historical Context**: Breaking an Olympic record is a rare event. The 100m dash is a highly competitive event, and while records have been broken in the past, it typically requires an extraordinary athlete or a breakthrough in conditions or technology. 5. **Current Field**: As of the latest updates, there are no new athletes who have emerged with a strong likelihood of breaking the record, and the top competitors are not consistently running times close to 9.63 seconds.

Geomagnetic storms are influenced by solar activity, particularly solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can increase the Kp index. The Sun is currently in Solar Cycle 25, which began in December 2019. Solar cycles typically last about 11 years, with solar activity increasing towards the solar maximum and decreasing towards the solar minimum. As of 2024, we are likely approaching the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which is expected to occur around 2024-2025. During this period, increased solar activity, including solar flares and CMEs, can lead to more frequent and intense geomagnetic storms. Given the timing within the solar cycle, the probability of experiencing geomagnetic storms with a Kp index greater than 4 is relatively high. Historical data suggests that during the solar maximum, the frequency of days with Kp indices greater than 4 increases. Additionally, the 11-day period in question provides multiple opportunities for solar events to trigger geomagnetic storms.

Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine are major draws. The marketing for such a crossover is likely to be extensive, given the potential fanbase.\n\n3. **Historical Comparisons**: The sum of the openings for \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine\" is $185,548,391. This is a high benchmark, but considering the potential for increased interest due to the crossover and the inflation and growth in box office revenues since 2016, it is plausible that this figure could be surpassed.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: The current state of the box office, post-pandemic, shows a trend of strong openings for major franchise films. If \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is released during a period with favorable conditions (e.g., little competition, holiday season), it could significantly boost its opening numbers.\n\n5. **Potential Risks**: There are risks such as potential competition from other major releases, changes in consumer behavior, or unforeseen events affecting theater attendance.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there are uncertainties, the potential for a successful opening is strong given the combination of beloved characters, star power, and market trends."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "03abb124-31bf-43f7-acf0-ce20b73b60ee", "title": "[Metaculus] Will the domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" be higher than that of \"Deadpool\"?", "body": "Will the domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" be higher than that of \"Deadpool\"?\\n\\nResolves the same as the original on Metaculus.\\n\\n(https://www.metaculus.com/questions/question_embed/25850/?theme=dark)Resolution criteria\\n\\nThis question resolves as Yes if the domestic box office opening for the Deadpool & Wolverine reported by Boxofficemojo on the movie's page is higher than $132,434,639 which is the box opening for Deadpool (2016).\\n\\nFine print and additional background information can be found on Metaculus.\\n\\nOnce the original resolves, its resolution will be applied to this market automatically.

The combination of these two iconic characters is expected to generate significant buzz and anticipation.\n\n2. **Market Trends and Inflation**: Since 2016, box office revenues have generally increased due to inflation and rising ticket prices.

There are several factors to consider when assessing the likelihood of the US government ending this agreement before August 3, 2025: 1. Historical Precedent: The agreement has been consistently renewed in the past, suggesting a strong precedent for continuation rather than termination. 2. Importance of Stability: The .com TLD is the most widely used and recognized domain extension globally. Any abrupt changes in its management could lead to significant disruptions, which the US government is likely keen to avoid. 3. Lack of Clear Alternatives: There is no clear alternative to Verisign that has been identified or prepared to take over the management of the .com TLD, which makes a sudden termination of the agreement unlikely. 4. Regulatory and Policy Environment: Changes in the management of the .com TLD would require significant regulatory and policy shifts, which typically take considerable time to implement. 5. Economic and Political Considerations: Verisign is a large and influential company with significant lobbying power. Economic and political considerations might influence the decision to maintain the status quo.

Inflation trends, interest rates, and GDP growth are crucial indicators to watch. If the U.S. Federal Reserve maintains or increases interest rates, it could strengthen the USD against the JPY.\n\n2. **Monetary Policy**: The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has traditionally maintained a dovish stance with low or negative interest rates to stimulate the economy. If this policy continues, it could lead to a weaker JPY relative to the USD, especially if the U.S. maintains a comparatively tighter monetary policy.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Events**: Any significant geopolitical events, such as trade tensions, conflicts, or major policy changes, can cause volatility in currency markets. Currently, there are no major impending geopolitical events that could drastically affect the USD/JPY pair in the short term.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**: The market's perception of economic stability and growth prospects in the U.S. compared to Japan will influence exchange rates.

If the US economy is performing well relative to Japan, it could strengthen the USD against the JPY.\n\n2. **Monetary Policy**: The policies of the Federal Reserve in the US and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) are crucial.

Historically, silver prices are influenced by various economic indicators, including inflation rates, interest rates, geopolitical stability, industrial demand, and investor sentiment. As of October 2023, silver prices have seen fluctuations due to ongoing global economic uncertainties, including inflationary pressures and changes in monetary policies by major central banks.\n\n1. **Historical Price Trends**: Historically, silver prices have experienced significant volatility. Over the past decade, silver has rarely sustained levels above $30 for extended periods. The last major spike was in 2011, when prices briefly exceeded $40.\n\n2. **Current Economic Climate**: As of the latest data in 2023, inflationary pressures have been a significant concern, which could potentially drive precious metals prices higher as investors seek safe-haven assets. However, central banks are also actively managing interest rates to combat inflation, which could dampen demand for non-yielding assets like silver.\n\n3. **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment can significantly influence silver prices. If there is increased demand for silver as a hedge against economic uncertainty, prices could rise. However, if economic conditions stabilize or improve, demand for silver might decrease, keeping prices below the $30.50 mark.\n\n4. **Industrial Demand**: Silver has extensive industrial applications, and demand from sectors like electronics and solar energy can impact prices. Any significant changes in these industries could affect silver prices.\n\n5. **Geopolitical Factors**: Unforeseen geopolitical events can lead to market volatility. Any such events close to the resolution date could impact silver prices.\n\nGiven these factors, while there is a possibility that silver could rise above $30.50 by August 9th, 2024, it would require a combination of sustained economic uncertainty, strong investor demand, and possibly geopolitical tensions.

Historically, legal proceedings and investigations involving high-profile figures like Donald Trump can be lengthy and complex. The legal system requires substantial evidence to bring charges, particularly in a high-stakes case involving a former president.\n\n2. **Political and Legal Context**: The political environment can influence the timing and nature of charges.

If \"Trap\" has been marketed effectively and has generated buzz, this could drive higher attendance.\n\n3. **Genre and Competition**: The genre of the film and the competitive landscape during its release can impact its performance. If \"Trap\" is in a genre that typically performs well and faces little competition from other major releases, it has a better chance of surpassing $15 million.\n\n4. **Current Box Office Trends**: Understanding the current state of the box office, including any effects from the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, can provide insight. If audiences are returning to theaters in large numbers, this could positively affect the film's performance.\n\n5. **Pre-release Reception**: Early reviews and audience reactions can significantly impact box office results. If \"Trap\" receives positive early reviews, it may encourage more people to see the film during its opening weekend.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is some uncertainty, the combination of Shyamalan's established fanbase, the performance of his previous films, and the potential for effective marketing suggests a reasonable probability that \"Trap\" will exceed the $15 million mark."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

If theaters are operating at full capacity and there is no significant competition from other major releases during the same weekend, this could positively impact \"Trap's\" performance.\n\n3. **Marketing and Hype**: The level of marketing and public interest in \"Trap\" will play a significant role. If the film has been effectively marketed and has generated buzz, it is more likely to attract a large audience during its opening weekend.\n\n4. **Genre and Audience**: Shyamalan's films often fall into the thriller/horror genre, which can have a dedicated audience base. If \"Trap\" appeals to this audience and has positive pre-release reviews, it could bolster its opening weekend performance.\n\n5. **Comparative Performance**: Looking at similar films released around the same time, especially those from Shyamalan, can provide insights. If \"Trap\" is similar in appeal and quality to \"Old,\" it stands a good chance of surpassing $15 million.\n\nConsidering these factors, it seems plausible that \"Trap\" could exceed $15 million, especially given Shyamalan's track record and the typical performance of his films."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, these operations are often carried out with precision to minimize casualties and avoid escalation. 2. Current Geopolitical Tensions: As of the latest updates, tensions between Israel and Iran remain high. Israel perceives Iran's nuclear ambitions as a significant threat, and Iran's support for groups hostile to Israel adds to the tension.

Any significant military planning or operations would likely have been in the pipeline for some time, and while Israel is capable of rapid action, such operations would still require considerable planning and intelligence. 4.

The Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida is one of Disney's flagship parks, and introducing new attractions or entertainment, such as a night parade, can be a big draw for visitors. Historically, Disney has used D23 to announce new parades and shows, as these are key elements of the park experience. However, predicting a new night parade announcement involves several factors:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Disney has a history of night parades, such as the Main Street Electrical Parade and Paint the Night, but these have been rotated between parks rather than new parades being frequently introduced. The introduction of a completely new parade would be a significant investment and decision.\n\n2. **Current Entertainment Lineup**: The Magic Kingdom's current entertainment offerings and any gaps or opportunities for enhancement might influence the likelihood of a new parade announcement. If there is currently a lack of nighttime entertainment or a gap due to the end of a previous parade, this could increase the likelihood of a new announcement.\n\n3. **Recent Announcements and Trends**: If Disney has announced other major projects or investments recently, they may be less likely to introduce a new parade due to budgetary constraints or strategic focus. Conversely, if there have been no major announcements, they might be gearing up for a significant reveal.\n\n4. **Insider Information and Rumors**: Often, industry insiders or leaks can provide hints about upcoming announcements.

Positive indicators can boost market confidence and drive the index higher.\n\n3. **Global Economic Environment**: The global economic climate, including factors like US Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, oil prices, and international trade relations, can significantly impact the Indian stock market.\n\n4. **Domestic Political and Economic Stability**: Political stability and government policies, especially those related to economic reforms and fiscal measures, can affect market performance.\n\n5. **Market Sentiment and External Shocks**: Investor sentiment can be volatile and influenced by unforeseen events such as natural disasters, pandemics, or geopolitical conflicts.\n\nGiven these considerations, if the SENSEX is currently significantly below 75,000, reaching this level by July 21, 2024, would require substantial growth in a relatively short period, which could be challenging.

Historically, indices tend to rise over time, but the specific level of 76,000 to 77,000 is relatively high, indicating significant growth from previous years.\n\n2. **Current Economic Conditions**: As of the last data available to me (October 2023), global and Indian economic conditions will significantly influence the SENSEX. Factors such as GDP growth, inflation rates, interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of India, and global economic conditions (e.g., US Federal Reserve policies, geopolitical tensions) will all play a role.\n\n3. **Market Volatility**: Stock markets are inherently volatile, and predicting a specific range for an index like the SENSEX on a particular day is challenging. The range of 76,000 to 77,000 is narrow, making it even more challenging to predict accurately.\n\n4. **Recent Performance**: If the SENSEX has been trending upwards and is near the 76,000 mark in the weeks leading up to July 21, 2024, the probability of it closing within the specified range increases. Conversely, if it is significantly below this range, the probability decreases.\n\n5. **External Events**: Unpredictable events such as political changes, natural disasters, or significant corporate news can impact market performance.\n\nConsidering these factors, while it is possible for the SENSEX to close within this range, the specificity of the range (only a 1,000-point window) and the inherent unpredictability of the stock market make it a challenging prediction.

For the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Russian athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) flag rather than the national flag due to these sanctions.\n\nAs of my last update, the sanctions imposed on Russia by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in December 2020, which included a ban on the Russian flag and anthem at major international competitions, were set to last until December 2022. However, the geopolitical landscape, particularly the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has also led to increased scrutiny and potential for further sanctions against Russia in international sports.\n\nGiven these factors, it is plausible that similar restrictions could be extended to the 2024 Olympics, especially considering the historical precedent and the current geopolitical tensions. The IOC and other international sports bodies are likely to continue taking a cautious approach regarding Russia's participation under its national flag.\n\nTherefore, it seems likely that Russian athletes will face restrictions similar to those in previous Olympics, where they may compete under a neutral or alternative flag rather than the national Russian flag.

As of late 2023, India was experiencing moderate economic growth, with inflation being a concern that could affect market performance.\n\n3. **Global Factors**: Global economic conditions, including interest rates set by major economies like the US, geopolitical tensions, and commodity prices, can impact investor sentiment and market performance.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**: Investor confidence, driven by corporate earnings, government policies, and foreign investment, plays a crucial role. Positive sentiment could push the index higher, while negative news could have the opposite effect.\n\n5. **Timeframe**: The time between the question creation and the resolution date is short (less than two weeks), which limits the potential for drastic market movements unless there is a significant catalyst.\n\nGiven these factors, while the SENSEX could potentially reach or exceed 75,000, it would require a strong bullish trend or a significant positive catalyst. Without specific information about such catalysts, the probability of the SENSEX closing above 75,000 by the specified date seems moderate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
