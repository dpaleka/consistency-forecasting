The existence of a drafted letter and the involvement of Rep. Jared Huffman suggests that there is at least some momentum behind this opposition.

At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, several countries won their first-ever medals, including Burkina Faso, Turkmenistan, San Marino, and others. Additionally, countries like Bermuda and the Philippines won their first-ever gold medals. This trend is likely to continue, especially with the inclusion of sports that have a wide international reach, such as skateboarding, surfing, and sport climbing, which were introduced in Tokyo and are likely to be retained or expanded in Paris. Moreover, the Olympics are increasingly emphasizing inclusivity and diversity, which may encourage participation from countries that have not been traditionally strong in the medal standings. The Paris Olympics could see the inclusion of more mixed-gender events and sports that are popular in regions that have historically been underrepresented in the medal tally.

His chances of being favored by FiveThirtyEight would depend on various factors, including his approval ratings, economic conditions, and how he is perceived to have handled major issues. Historically, incumbents have a slight advantage, but considering the polarized political climate and the potential for unforeseen events, it's challenging to predict.

GUE/NGL has traditionally held fewer seats compared to these major groups.\n\n3. **Political Climate**: While there is increasing attention on climate issues, which could benefit the Greens\u2013EFA, there is no strong indication that this will translate into them becoming the largest group. The political landscape in Europe is fragmented, and while smaller parties may gain seats, surpassing the EPP or S&D would require a significant shift.\n\n4. **Electoral Dynamics**: The European Parliament elections are influenced by national politics across EU member states. Major parties in large countries like Germany, France, and Italy heavily influence the overall composition of the Parliament. These countries have traditionally supported larger groups like the EPP and S&D.\n\n5. **Potential for Ties**: For the question to resolve as YES, either group could tie for the most seats. However, the probability of this happening is also low given the distribution of seats and the presence of multiple large parties.\n\nConsidering these factors, it seems unlikely that either GUE/NGL or Greens\u2013EFA will hold the most seats after the 2024 elections."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given the context provided, public opinion polls show Biden losing to Trump but other Democrats performing better against Trump. This suggests that Biden may indeed perform worse compared to a generic Democrat, potentially leading to a scenario where Trump's support increases by at least 3% when facing Biden.

Traditionally, Les R\u00e9publicains, a center-right party, has maintained a distance from the far-right National Rally due to significant ideological differences and the stigma associated with the latter's far-right positions. Historically, French politics has seen a strong \"cordon sanitaire\" around the National Rally, preventing mainstream parties from forming alliances with it. However, recent political trends in Europe and France show a shift where mainstream parties have occasionally collaborated with far-right parties to consolidate power, especially in cases where the political landscape is fragmented, and no single party can secure a majority.

Both individuals are prominent figures, with Mark Kelly being a U.S. Senator from Arizona and Josh Shapiro being the Governor of Pennsylvania. Their selection could be influenced by their appeal to key demographic and geographic voter bases. However, without specific insider information or strong public indications, predicting a VP pick is inherently uncertain. Historically, such decisions are closely guarded until officially announced.\n\n(b) Linked Market Traders: The probability of the linked market reaching 377 traders depends on the market's current activity and interest levels. If the market is actively traded and has garnered significant attention, reaching 377 traders is plausible. However, without access to the current number of traders or trends in trader activity, it's difficult to precisely estimate this probability.\n\nGiven the uncertainties in both conditions, particularly the unpredictability of a VP pick, the overall probability of the question resolving YES is moderate.

The political landscape can change significantly over a short period due to various factors such as economic conditions, major political events, or shifts in public opinion. As of my last update, Trump and Biden are key figures in American politics, and their polling numbers can fluctuate. The specific requirement for Trump's lead to be between 2 and 3 points is a narrow margin, making this condition moderately challenging to predict. Historical polling trends and current events leading up to July 2024 would need to be considered, but given the variability in polling and public opinion, the probability of this specific range occurring is not very high. 2.

Historical Context and Trends: Historically, FiveThirtyEight's forecasts have been influenced by a variety of factors, including polling data, economic indicators, and political developments. As of the latest data available (October 2023), Joe Biden is the incumbent president, and incumbents often have an advantage in elections. However, this can be offset by various factors such as economic performance, approval ratings, and significant political events. 2. Polling Data: Polls leading up to the 2024 election will play a crucial role in shaping FiveThirtyEight's forecast. If Biden maintains a lead in national and key swing state polls, it is likely that FiveThirtyEight will project him as the favorite. If, however, Trump shows strong polling numbers, especially in critical states, this could shift the forecast in his favor. 3. FiveThirtyEight's Methodology: The methodology used by FiveThirtyEight incorporates a wide range of data, including polling, economic indicators, and historical election outcomes. Their model tends to be dynamic and responsive to new information, so any major developments (e.g., economic downturns, political scandals, or significant policy achievements) could impact the forecast. 4. Current Political Climate: As of October 2023, the political climate is highly polarized. Biden's approval ratings, the state of the economy, and other political developments will significantly impact his chances. Trump's legal challenges and political activities will also influence his candidacy and public perception. 5. Timeframe Considerations: The forecast for July 19, 2024, is still several months away, making it difficult to predict with high certainty. However, based on the current trajectory and historical patterns, incumbents generally have an edge unless there are significant negative developments.

This speculation might have been fueled by media reports and possibly hints from people involved with the movie.\n\n2. **Industry Trends**: Cameos by celebrities in superhero movies are not uncommon, and they often generate additional buzz and marketing value. The \"Deadpool\" franchise, in particular, is known for its humor and breaking the fourth wall, which makes it a fitting environment for a surprise celebrity cameo.\n\n3. **Taylor Swift's Recent Activities**: Taylor Swift has been active in exploring roles outside of music, including acting. Her involvement in a high-profile movie could align with her career interests.\n\n4. **Lack of Official Confirmation**: As of now, there is no official confirmation from the film's producers or Taylor Swift herself.

For example, at the 2016 Rio Olympics, 27 world records were broken, while at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 33 world records were broken. The trend in recent Olympics suggests that breaking 24 or more world records is plausible, especially given advancements in technology, training, and the introduction of new events.\n   - However, predicting the exact number of world records is inherently uncertain due to factors like weather conditions, athlete performance, and the nature of the events.\n\n2. **France's Performance:**\n   - France has historically been a strong contender in the Olympics. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, France placed 8th in the medal table with 10 golds, 12 silvers, and 11 bronzes. However, the 2024 Olympics being held in Paris might provide a home advantage, potentially boosting their performance.\n   - France has a strong tradition in various sports, and being the host nation often correlates with improved performance due to familiar environments, local support, and increased investment in training and facilities leading up to the event.\n\nConsidering both factors, the probability of at least one of these conditions being met is relatively high. The historical data on world records suggests that breaking 24 is feasible, and France's potential for a top 5 finish is bolstered by the home advantage in 2024.

Given that the resolution date is at the end of July 2024, there is a relatively short time frame remaining for such an event to occur. The political calendar might include opportunities for Biden to engage in longer interviews, especially considering the upcoming presidential election in November 2024. Candidates often seek media exposure to communicate their messages to the public, which could increase the likelihood of a lengthy interview happening.

While the Greens have been successful in certain regions, overtaking these larger groups to hold the most seats remains a significant challenge. However, political dynamics can shift rapidly, and environmental issues are becoming more prominent, potentially boosting their support. Still, the probability of them holding the most seats is relatively low given historical trends.\n\nConsidering the independent probabilities of these events, the probability of at least one occurring is the sum of their probabilities minus the probability of both occurring simultaneously (which is likely very low given their independence).

Additionally, Democratic Senators are likely to be cautious about publicly opposing a sitting president from their own party, as it could create division within the party and potentially harm their own political standing.\n\nHowever, unforeseen events, such as major scandals, health issues, or drastic changes in political circumstances, could change the dynamics and lead to such calls.

However, several factors make the likelihood of Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot under this provision relatively low.\n\n1. **Legal Precedent and Interpretation**: There is limited precedent for applying Section 3 of the 14th Amendment in modern times, especially to a presidential candidate. The courts would need to interpret the applicability of this section in the context of Trump's actions, which is not straightforward and could face significant legal challenges.\n\n2. **Political Considerations**: Removing a former president and leading political figure like Trump from the ballot would be a highly politicized action. States may be hesitant to take such a step without clear legal backing and overwhelming evidence, to avoid setting a controversial precedent or facing backlash from voters.\n\n3. **Judicial Process**: Even if a state attempted to remove Trump from the ballot, the decision would likely be contested in courts, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. The judicial process could delay any final decision past the resolution date of July 15, 2024.\n\n4. **Timing and Resolution Criteria**: The resolution criteria specify that Trump must be officially removed or blocked as of July 15, 2024.

Israel has been known to carry out covert operations and cyberattacks to disrupt Iran's nuclear capabilities. However, direct military attacks within Iran's borders are less common due to the potential for significant escalation.\n\n2. **Recent Developments**: As of the created date in April 2024, there may have been recent developments in the geopolitical landscape, such as changes in Iran's nuclear activities, shifts in alliances, or provocations that could influence Israel's decision-making. Without specific recent events indicating increased tensions or imminent threats, the likelihood of a direct attack remains moderate.\n\n3. **Strategic Considerations**: Israel would weigh the risks of international condemnation and potential retaliation from Iran or its allies. A deadly attack within Iran could lead to a broader conflict, which Israel typically aims to avoid unless it perceives an existential threat.\n\n4. **Timing**: The question was created on April 13, 2024, giving a short window until May 1, 2024, for such an event to occur.

Condition 1: An athlete wins more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Traditionally, tennis at the Olympics offers medals in singles and doubles (men's, women's, and mixed doubles). Winning more than one medal in tennis is challenging but not unprecedented. A player would need to compete and excel in multiple categories.

The term \"Individual Neutral Athletes\" usually refers to athletes who compete under a neutral flag, often due to sanctions on their home country. In recent Olympics, such as Tokyo 2020, athletes from Russia competed under the ROC (Russian Olympic Committee) banner and won 20 gold medals.

These include historical polling trends, the current political climate, and the reliability of polling data.\n\n1. **Historical Polling Trends**: Historically, national polling averages can fluctuate significantly as the election approaches, influenced by events, debates, and campaign strategies. Trump's lead or deficit has varied in past elections, and small leads or deficits are common.\n\n2. **Current Political Climate**: The political climate leading up to July 2024 will play a crucial role. Factors such as economic performance, major legislative achievements or failures, and international events can influence voter sentiment. As of the latest data, if Trump's lead is close to 2.4 points (as of July 5, 2024), it suggests a competitive race but does not necessarily imply a significant shift to a 3-4 point lead.\n\n3. **Polling Reliability**: Polls have margins of error, and different pollsters may have varying methodologies. 538 aggregates these polls to provide a more stable average, but this average can still be subject to sudden changes due to new data or major events.\n\n4. **Recent Trends**: If recent trends show a steady increase in Trump's lead, it could suggest a higher probability of reaching a 3-4 point lead. Conversely, if the trend is stable or decreasing, the probability would be lower.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it is possible for Trump's lead to fall within the specified range, it is a relatively narrow band (only a 1-point range).

As of my last update, polling data can fluctuate significantly over time, especially as the election date approaches and more voters make up their minds.

If the trend leading up to July 2024 shows a strengthening USD or a weakening JPY, it could suggest a higher likelihood of the exchange rate reaching or exceeding 145 JPY. 2. **Monetary Policy**: The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan's monetary policies significantly impact the exchange rate. If the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates or maintains a relatively higher interest rate compared to Japan, this could strengthen the USD against the JPY. Conversely, if the Bank of Japan maintains its low or negative interest rate policy, it might weaken the JPY further. 3. **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation rates, and trade balances for both the US and Japan will play a crucial role. Stronger economic performance in the US relative to Japan could support a stronger USD. 4. **Geopolitical Factors**: Any geopolitical tensions or disruptions in Asia or globally can lead to currency fluctuations. The JPY is often considered a safe-haven currency, but significant geopolitical risks could either strengthen or weaken it depending on the context. 5. **Market Sentiment and Speculation**: Currency markets are also influenced by speculative activities and market sentiment. If traders anticipate a stronger USD, this could drive the exchange rate higher. Considering these factors, if the USD/JPY exchange rate has been trending towards 145 or higher in the months leading up to August 2024, and the macroeconomic environment supports a stronger USD or weaker JPY, the probability of the exchange rate being at least 145 on August 9th, 2024, would be higher.

Nikki Haley as the Republican Nominee: As of October 2023, Donald Trump remains a strong contender for the Republican nomination, although there is significant competition and uncertainty within the party. Nikki Haley, a former U.N. Ambassador and Governor of South Carolina, is a prominent figure in the Republican Party and has been considered a potential candidate. However, she faces strong competition from other candidates, including Trump and possibly Ron DeSantis, among others.

However, applying this section to Trump is legally unprecedented and would likely face significant legal challenges.\n\n1. **Legal Precedent and Challenges**: There is no established legal precedent for applying Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to a modern political figure like Trump. Any attempt to do so would likely be met with immediate legal challenges, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. The courts would need to interpret the applicability of this section to Trump, which is uncertain.\n\n2. **Political and Legal Environment**: The political environment in the U.S. is highly polarized, and any state attempting to remove Trump from the ballot would face intense scrutiny and backlash from his supporters. This could deter states from taking such action unless they have strong legal backing.\n\n3. **State Actions**: While some states with Democratic leadership might be more inclined to explore this legal avenue, doing so would require a solid legal basis to withstand the inevitable court battles. As of now, there has been no successful case of using Section 3 to disqualify a candidate in recent history.\n\n4. **Timing**: The timeline is also a factor.

The process would require significant legal victories which have not yet occurred.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a non-zero probability of this happening, the combination of legal uncertainty, political resistance, and the required timeline make it unlikely that Trump will be officially removed or blocked from a primary ballot under these grounds by the specified date."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "effd2934-1ec3-4a74-b0a6-cacfcf5929e6", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden has an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024 (b) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024?", "body": "(a) Joe Biden must appear in an in-person interview for at least 45 minutes before the end of July 2024.
