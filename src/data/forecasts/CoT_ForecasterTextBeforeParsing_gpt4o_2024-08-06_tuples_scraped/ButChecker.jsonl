Given the strong presence of these candidates and others like Nikki Haley and Mike Pence, the probability of either Youngkin or Elder securing the nomination is relatively low.\n\nAdditionally, historical trends show that Republican nominations tend to favor candidates with substantial political experience or significant national profiles, which Youngkin and Elder currently lack compared to others in the field.

The nominee is often decided well before the official convention through the primary process. As of now, Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has announced his intention to run for re-election. Historically, incumbent presidents who run for re-election are almost always re-nominated by their party.

To assess this probability, several factors need to be considered:\n\n1. **Historical Context and Relations**: Israel and Iran have a longstanding adversarial relationship, with tensions often escalating due to geopolitical, military, and nuclear-related issues. Israel has previously conducted covert operations and attacks in the region, particularly targeting Iranian interests and personnel in Syria and other locations. However, direct attacks within Iran are less common and typically involve high-level strategic considerations.\n\n2. **Current Geopolitical Climate**: As of the latest information available (April 2024), the geopolitical climate in the Middle East is tense but not at an unprecedented level of hostility. There have been no recent major escalations that would suggest an imminent Israeli attack on Iranian soil leading to significant casualties.\n\n3. **Strategic Calculations**: Any attack within Iran would entail significant risks for Israel, including potential retaliation from Iran and increased regional instability. Such actions are usually carefully calculated and often involve international diplomatic considerations. \n\n4. **Recent Developments**: The timeframe for this question is quite short (from April 13, 2024, to May 1, 2024), which limits the likelihood of new developments leading to a significant attack. There have been no credible reports or intelligence suggesting an impending attack of this nature within this short window.\n\n5. **International Reactions and Constraints**: The international community, including the United States and European allies, often plays a moderating role in preventing escalations between Israel and Iran. Diplomatic efforts and backchannel communications can reduce the likelihood of such direct confrontations.\n\nGiven these factors, while it is not impossible for Israel to conduct an operation within Iran, the specific criteria of the question (resulting in at least five deaths) and the short timeframe make it less likely.\n\nProbability: 0.15"}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "4266cc02-37c5-4b4a-b5ee-247500d2675c", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Iran's Guardian Council includes Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's name on its list of approved presidential candidates, and (b) Israel does not carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (a) Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is included in Iran's Guardian Council's list of qualified presidential candidates for the upcoming presidential election, and (b) there are no credible reports indicating that an attack attributed to Israel and occurring within Iran's borders has led to the death of at least five individuals between the date of this question's publication and May 1, 2024.", "resolution_date": "2024-06-11T06:59:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-13T22:04:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.15, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To determine the probability of this question resolving 'Yes,' we need to assess the likelihood of both conditions (a) and (b) being met.

In the past, he has been disqualified from running in presidential elections by the Guardian Council, which is known for its conservative stance and strict vetting process. Given this history, the likelihood of him being approved as a candidate is relatively low unless there are significant political shifts or pressures that favor his candidacy. (b) No deadly attack by Israel within Iran before May 1, 2024: Israel and Iran have a history of tension and conflict, with occasional reports of covert operations and attacks attributed to Israel within Iran. However, large-scale deadly attacks resulting in multiple casualties are less frequent. While the geopolitical situation is tense, the absence of such an attack within the specified timeframe is plausible, as Israel typically conducts operations with a focus on minimizing overt escalation. Considering these factors, the probability of Ahmadinejad being approved is low, while the probability of no deadly Israeli attack is moderate to high.

While such operations have occurred, they are often covert and not widely reported, especially not with clear attribution to Israel. The threshold for this scenario is relatively high, requiring the death of at least five individuals and credible reports attributing the attack to Israel. Given the sensitive nature of such operations and the geopolitical implications, a direct and deadly attack attributed to Israel may not be highly likely, but it is not impossible. Tensions between Israel and Iran remain high, and unpredictable escalations could occur.\n\n2. **Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's candidacy**: Ahmadinejad has been a controversial figure in Iranian politics. While he has attempted to run for president again in the past, the Guardian Council, which vets candidates, has typically not approved his candidacy in recent elections. The political climate in Iran is complex, and the Guardian Council's decisions are influenced by various factors, including internal politics and international relations.

Additionally, the EU has been increasingly vocal about its commitment to fair trade practices and addressing market distortions caused by state subsidies, which are often a point of contention with China.\n\nMoreover, the EU Commission has been actively investigating and assessing the impact of Chinese EV imports on the European market. If these investigations reveal significant harm to EU industries, the likelihood of imposing tariffs increases.\n\nHowever, imposing new tariffs is a complex decision that involves weighing the potential economic benefits against the diplomatic and trade repercussions. The EU might also be cautious about escalating trade tensions with China, given the broader economic and political implications.\n\nGiven these considerations, while there is a reasonable chance that the EU could announce new tariffs, it is not a certainty.

While he is the oldest sitting president, there has been no public indication of severe health issues that would necessitate resignation or incapacitation. However, his age does increase the probability of health-related issues arising. 2. **Political Stability**: As of my last update in October 2023, there have been no significant political movements or scandals that suggest Biden might resign or be removed from office. His administration has faced challenges, but these are typical of any presidency and do not currently threaten his position. 3. **25th Amendment Considerations**: The 25th Amendment allows for the temporary transfer of power to the Vice President if the President is incapacitated. However, this does not affect the resolution of the question unless Kamala Harris is formally designated as Acting President before July 26, 2024. Historically, such transfers are rare and typically short-lived, often related to medical procedures. 4. **Precedent and Historical Context**: Historically, U.S. Presidents rarely resign or are removed from office outside of exceptional circumstances (e.g., Nixon's resignation). The likelihood of Biden resigning or being removed within the next few months is low based on historical precedent. 5. **Kamala Harris\u2019s Role**: For the question to resolve NO, Harris would need to be formally designated as President or Acting President. Given the current political climate and Biden's standing, this scenario seems unlikely unless unforeseen events occur.

For the second event, whether the market will have at least 377 traders by the specified deadline depends on the current number of traders and the market's activity level. Without access to the URL or the current number of traders, we can't accurately assess this. However, if the market is popular or has been trending, it might reach the required number of traders. If it is relatively unknown, it might not. Given these considerations, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

Georgia's voting allies and their presence in the same semi-final could impact the outcome. 5.

If Trump decides to run, he would likely be a strong contender due to his substantial base of support.\n\n2. **Polls and Popularity**: As of the latest data, Ted Cruz has not been leading in early polls for the 2024 Republican nomination.

Cruz fits this profile, but so do other potential candidates.\n\n4. **Party Dynamics**: Internal party dynamics, such as endorsements, campaign funding, and political alliances, will play a crucial role. Cruz has a strong conservative base but may not appeal as broadly as some other candidates.\n\n5. **Events and Debates**: Future events, debates, and primary performances will significantly impact Cruz's chances.

Notably, episodes towards the end of the season had higher ratings, with several episodes scoring above 9.0. For Season 2, the ratings have been more varied, with two episodes scoring below 8.0, one episode scoring as high as 9.6, and others around the 8.4 mark.

Episode 4 of Season 2 achieved a very high rating of 9.6, suggesting that when an episode is well-received, it can score significantly higher than 8.5.\n\n3. **Audience Expectations and Series Momentum**: The series has a strong fan base and generally high production values, which can contribute to higher ratings. The anticipation for new episodes can also drive initial high ratings, although these can adjust over time as more viewers rate the episode.\n\n4. **Strict Inequality**: The resolution criteria require the episode to be rated strictly greater than 8.5, which means an 8.5 rating would not suffice.

Historically, this has never happened, and there is no current public indication or speculation that such a scenario is likely for President Biden before August 2024. Therefore, the probability of this event occurring is very low.\n\nFor the second event, FiveThirtyEight's projections are based on polling data, historical trends, and other factors. As of my last update in October 2023, President Biden was expected to run for re-election, and the political landscape was quite competitive. FiveThirtyEight's projections are subject to change based on evolving political dynamics, but given Biden's incumbency and the usual advantages it confers, it is plausible that he could be projected as the favorite at some point. However, the specific date of July 19, 2024, is crucial, and the projection will depend on the political circumstances and polling data available at that time. Considering FiveThirtyEight's methodology and the typical volatility of election forecasts, there is a reasonable chance that Biden could be favored, especially if he maintains or improves his standing in the polls.\n\nOverall, while the probability of the first event is very low, the second event has a moderate likelihood, increasing the overall probability of a YES resolution."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07046448252078176, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

If the polling data has shown consistent fluctuations, the probability of the lead being within this specific range decreases. 3. **Political Context**: The political landscape, including any major legislative achievements or failures, international events, or changes in the candidates' campaigns, can impact polling. A stable political environment might suggest less volatility in polling numbers. 4. **Timing**: The question asks for a specific date, July 15, 2024. As we approach this date, the probability of significant changes in polling decreases compared to earlier in the election cycle, assuming no major disruptive events.

The number of countries that typically achieve this milestone in any given Olympics is often lower, but it can vary significantly depending on geopolitical and sporting developments.
