His age has been a point of discussion regarding his capacity to serve a full term. However, as of the latest information, there have been no significant health issues reported that would suggest he is unable to complete his term.\n\n2. **Political Stability**: The United States has a stable political system with a history of presidents completing their terms unless extraordinary circumstances arise (e.g., assassination, severe health issues, or impeachment). There are no significant ongoing political movements or legal challenges that appear likely to result in Biden leaving office before July 2024.\n\n3. **Precedent**: Historically, most U.S. presidents have completed their terms. The last president who did not complete his term was Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. There are no current indications of a scandal of such magnitude involving Biden.\n\n4. **Temporary Transfer of Power**: The question specifies that a temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment does not count as Biden ceasing to be President. This means that even if there were a temporary health issue requiring such a transfer, it would not affect the resolution of the question.\n\nOverall, considering the lack of significant health concerns, political stability, and historical precedent, the probability of Biden remaining President through the end of July 2024 is high."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "3890bdcd-5680-4da4-bc81-5bfe1275da76", "title": "Will Joe Biden die before Saturday or will he cease to be President before the end of July 2024?", "body": "Resolves YES if either (a) there is an official announcement of Joe Biden's death before market close at the end of Friday, July 26th, or (b) Joe Biden resigns, dies, or otherwise ceases to be US President before the end of July 2024 (ET).

There have been no widely reported health crises that suggest an imminent risk of death within the next few weeks. \n\n2. **Ceasing to be President**: This could occur through resignation, impeachment, or other extraordinary circumstances. Historically, presidents rarely resign unless there is significant political pressure or scandal, and there have been no major indications of such issues in Biden's administration as of the latest data. Impeachment is a lengthy process and would require significant political motivation and evidence, which does not appear to be present.\n\n3. **Timeframe**: The timeframe for the first condition (death before July 26, 2024) is quite short, reducing the likelihood of this condition being met. The second condition has a slightly longer timeframe (until the end of July 2024), but still, the probability of Biden ceasing to be President under normal circumstances remains low given the current political and health context.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the probability is not zero due to the inherent uncertainties of health and political dynamics, it remains relatively low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 1.6607312000574976, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.5535770666858325, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 2.9047375096555617, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historically, it is uncommon for a large number of party members to publicly oppose their sitting president's nomination, particularly if the president is seeking re-election. While there may be individual dissenters or small groups, reaching a threshold of 20 signatories would imply a substantial rift or controversy that is not typical. The mention of a drafted letter by Rep. Jared Huffman indicates some level of unrest, but without further evidence of widespread support, this scenario seems unlikely. (b) The scenario where 10 or more Democratic Senators call for Biden to drop out is even more drastic. Such a public call would signify a major crisis of confidence in Biden's leadership from within his own party. Historically, it is rare for sitting presidents to face such open calls to step down from members of their own party, especially in the absence of a major scandal or significant drop in approval ratings.

This could provoke a larger conflict, something both nations have historically been cautious about avoiding.\n\n3. **International and Domestic Considerations**: Israel's actions are often influenced by its relationships with major powers, particularly the United States. A significant attack within Iran could strain these relationships, especially if it occurs without broader international support or justification. Domestically, Israeli leadership must consider the potential repercussions of such an action, including retaliatory attacks from Iran or its proxies.\n\n4. **Timing and Strategic Calculations**: Given the short time frame until May 1, 2024, the likelihood of Israel conducting a large-scale attack that results in at least five deaths is limited.

For Nvidia to surpass Apple by July 2024, it would require either a substantial increase in Nvidia's valuation or a significant decline in Apple's. While Nvidia's growth has been impressive, surpassing Apple in such a short timeframe would be unprecedented without extraordinary circumstances affecting Apple's stock negatively or Nvidia's positively.\n\n(b) Democratic Lawmakers Pressuring Biden: Joe Biden, as the incumbent president running for re-election, generally has strong support from his party. While there may be individual dissenters or calls for him to step down, organizing a group of at least five Democratic lawmakers to publicly pressure him to drop out would indicate significant internal party strife. Given the Democratic Party's tendency to rally around incumbents and the lack of major public dissatisfaction with Biden at this time, this scenario seems unlikely unless unforeseen political dynamics emerge.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, while Nvidia's growth potential is noteworthy, surpassing Apple's market cap remains improbable in the given timeframe.

Historical trends can provide some insight, but currency markets are highly volatile. 2. Economic Indicators: Key economic indicators from both the United States and Japan can affect the exchange rate. For the US, factors such as interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, inflation rates, GDP growth, and employment figures are critical. For Japan, the Bank of Japan's monetary policy, inflation, and economic growth are significant. 3. Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates can strengthen or weaken the USD. If the Fed continues or increases rate hikes, this could strengthen the USD relative to the JPY. Conversely, if Japan maintains a low interest rate policy, the JPY could weaken further against the USD. 4. Geopolitical Factors: Any geopolitical tensions or events can cause currency volatility.

The team's medical staff and player management strategies will play a role in mitigating this risk. 3. **Competition**: The NBA is highly competitive, with teams like the Denver Nuggets, Golden State Warriors, and Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference, as well as strong teams in the Eastern Conference like the Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics. The Clippers will need to navigate through these teams to win the championship. 4. **Coaching and Management**: The Clippers' coaching staff, led by Tyronn Lue, is experienced and has had success in the playoffs. Their strategies and adjustments throughout the season and playoffs will be pivotal. 5. **Market Odds and Expert Predictions**: Betting markets and expert analysts provide insights into the likelihood of each team winning the championship.

Kamala Harris' VP Pick: The probability of Kamala Harris choosing either Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro as her VP pick depends on several factors including political strategy, public opinion, and internal Democratic Party dynamics. As of now, both Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are listed as favorites, which suggests they have a reasonable chance. However, VP picks are often unpredictable and can be influenced by various unforeseen factors. Historically, favorites do not always end up being chosen, and other candidates could emerge as stronger contenders.

Linked Market Traders: The probability of the linked market reaching at least 377 traders by the deadline depends on the current number of traders and the trend of new traders joining the market. If the market is already close to 377 traders or has been rapidly gaining participants, the probability is higher. However, if it is far from this number or growth has been stagnant, the probability decreases.

Typically, financial or prediction markets can experience sudden surges in participation if there is heightened interest or news coverage, but this is not guaranteed.

While the publication of such reports is not uncommon in the AI community, it depends on their commitment to transparency and the completion of external red-teaming efforts. If Inflection has a history of being transparent and has announced or is known to be working on such efforts, the probability increases. However, without specific public commitments or a track record, this probability remains uncertain.\n\n(b) OpenAI's ChatGPT availability in the EU: OpenAI has shown interest in expanding its services globally, including in the EU. However, regulatory challenges, such as GDPR compliance, could impact availability. As of my last update, ChatGPT was generally available in many regions, and OpenAI has been responsive to regulatory requirements.

There has been considerable debate about whether this section could be applied to Donald Trump, especially in light of the events of January 6, 2021.

Historical Polling Trends: Historically, national polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time, especially as the election date approaches. In previous election cycles, polling leads have shifted due to various factors such as campaign events, debates, and major news developments. 2. Current Polling Data: As of the last known data in October 2023, we would need to look at the current polling averages. If Trump already has a lead close to the desired range, it might be more likely for the lead to stabilize or slightly adjust into that range by July 15, 2024. However, if the lead is significantly outside this range, either much higher or lower, it would be less likely for it to fall within the specified range. 3. Political and Economic Factors: The political landscape can change due to various factors such as economic performance, foreign policy issues, and domestic policies. These factors can influence public opinion and, consequently, polling averages. 4. Polling Methodology and Margin of Error: Polling averages incorporate multiple polls, each with its own methodology and margin of error. This means that even if the average shows a lead within the desired range, the true public opinion could be slightly different. 5. Uncertainty and Variability: Given the time frame until July 2024, there is inherent uncertainty in predicting exact polling numbers. The range specified (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) is quite narrow, which increases the difficulty of predicting such a specific outcome.

Given his history of using media attention to his advantage, he might see testifying as an opportunity to present his narrative directly to the public, especially if he believes it could benefit him politically or legally. Additionally, if his legal team assesses that his testimony could significantly impact the outcome in his favor, they might advise him to testify.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a possibility that Trump could testify, the likelihood is tempered by the common legal strategy of avoiding testimony and his past behavior in similar situations."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "709181f6-b527-4793-90f3-04732afc398f", "title": "Iran military response before August 13th midnight Eastern Time?", "body": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Iran initiates a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory between July 30 and August 12, 2024, 11:59 PM ET.

Current Geopolitical Tensions: As of October 2023, tensions between Iran and Israel remain high, but direct military confrontations have been avoided. The situation could change by mid-2024, but this would depend on various factors, including regional developments, internal politics within Iran, and international diplomatic efforts. 2.

The potential for severe retaliation from Israel and its allies, including the United States, could deter Iran from initiating a direct attack. 3. International Pressure and Diplomacy: The international community, particularly countries involved in the Iran nuclear deal and regional stability, may exert pressure on Iran to avoid direct military actions. Diplomatic channels and negotiations could play a role in preventing such escalations. 4.

Historically, sitting presidents often pursue a second term unless faced with significant health issues or political challenges. As of the latest information, there is no strong indication that Biden will not seek re-election. However, considering his age and potential health concerns, there is a non-zero probability that he might choose not to run.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, also known as the \"Disqualification Clause,\" was originally intended to prevent former Confederates from holding office after the Civil War.

However, applying this clause to a modern political figure like Trump is unprecedented, and the legal and political implications are complex.\n\nSeveral factors need to be considered:\n1. Legal Precedent: There is no recent precedent for using the 14th Amendment's Disqualification Clause in this context. Any attempt would likely face significant legal challenges and require robust evidence.\n2. Political Will: State officials or courts would need the political will to pursue such a removal, which could be contentious and polarizing.\n3. Legal Process: Even if a state attempted to remove Trump from the ballot, the decision would likely be contested in courts, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. The timeline for such legal proceedings could be lengthy, possibly extending beyond July 15, 2024.\n4. Public and Political Reaction: The move would likely provoke significant public and political reaction, both supporting and opposing the decision, which could influence the outcome.\n\nGiven these complexities, while there is a non-zero probability that some state might attempt to remove Trump under this clause, the likelihood of it being successfully executed and upheld by July 15, 2024, is relatively low.

Additionally, the number of countries competing in the semi-finals and the specific semi-final each country is placed in can affect their chances, as some semi-finals may be more competitive than others. Given that both countries have the potential to qualify based on past performances and the fact that only one of them needs to qualify for the question to resolve as YES, the probability is reasonably high.

There are a few factors to consider here: 1. Previous Announcements and Trends: Disney has a history of expanding and updating its theme parks with new attractions, often using its popular intellectual properties. Moana, being a successful and popular franchise, is a strong candidate for new attractions. However, Disney has already announced and is developing a Moana-themed attraction at EPCOT called 'Journey of Water, Inspired by Moana,' which might reduce the likelihood of another Moana ride being announced for the Magic Kingdom in the near term. 2. Strategic Planning and Theme Park Development: Announcing a major new ride requires significant planning and investment. Disney typically announces such projects years in advance. If a Moana ride were to be announced, there might have been hints or leaks prior to the D23 convention. As of now, there is no strong indication from reliable sources that a Moana ride is being planned specifically for the Magic Kingdom, which suggests it might not be imminent. 3. Focus of D23 Announcements: D23 is a major platform for Disney to announce new projects across its various segments, including theme parks. While new attractions are often announced, the focus can vary. Given the existing Moana project at EPCOT, Disney might choose to highlight other franchises or areas for the Magic Kingdom. 4. Market and Fan Expectations: While there is interest in Moana-related attractions, Disney may prioritize other projects or franchises that align better with its strategic goals or current park themes. Taking these factors into account, while it is possible that Disney could announce a Moana ride for the Magic Kingdom, the lack of prior indications and the existing Moana project at EPCOT suggest that it is not highly likely."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "041f6b48-cc4e-45bf-bf3b-117a28d105aa", "title": "Will Deadpool & Wolverine have biggest opening weekend ever for R-rated movie?

The Eurovision Song Contest format typically includes two semi-finals, and countries need to rank high enough in their semi-final to advance to the Grand Final. The likelihood of either country qualifying depends on their entries' quality, the competition they face in their respective semi-finals, and the voting patterns.\n\nIn recent years, both countries have shown they can produce strong entries that resonate with both juries and the public. Additionally, the number of countries that qualify from each semi-final usually provides a reasonable chance for multiple countries to advance. Given these considerations, there is a moderate probability that at least one of these countries will qualify for the Grand Final."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Conversely, a stable or improving economy might lead to lower volatility.\n\n2. **Market Sentiment**: Changes in investor sentiment can significantly impact volatility.

Israel has conducted covert operations and airstrikes in the past, primarily targeting Iranian assets in Syria and occasionally within Iran. 2. Recent Developments: As of the question's creation date in April 2024, there may have been recent developments that could influence the likelihood of an attack.

I would estimate the probability of this occurring to be moderate, around 0.3.\n\n(b) Kamala Harris being the Democratic VP: Kamala Harris is currently the Vice President, and it is customary for sitting VPs to be renominated unless there are significant political reasons not to. As of the last update, there has been no strong indication that Biden would replace Harris on the ticket. Therefore, the probability of Harris being renominated as the Democratic VP is high, likely around 0.8.\n\nTo find the probability of either event (a) or (b) occurring (or both), we use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Assuming independence for simplicity, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.3 * 0.8 = 0.24.

These coalitions typically consist of multiple parties that align on certain issues, and shifts in coalition membership can occur due to political disagreements, changes in public opinion, or strategic realignments.\n\n2. **Stability and Popularity**: The stability of a coalition often depends on its ability to maintain a majority in the National Assembly and the support of the President. If either New Popular Front or Together holds a significant majority and the President supports them, it is less likely that a new Prime Minister from a different coalition will emerge.\n\n3. **Upcoming Political Events**: Any upcoming elections, significant policy decisions, or political scandals could influence the composition of the government. If there are scheduled elections before July 2024, the results could lead to a change in the ruling coalition. Additionally, shifts in public opinion or economic conditions could pressure the current government to change its leadership or coalition structure.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: Historically, changes in the Prime Minister's party or coalition in France are not extremely frequent within a single term unless there are extraordinary circumstances.

Night Shyamalan's \"Trap\" receiving a CinemaScore of B or higher.\n\n1. **\"House of the Dragon\" S2E8**: \n   - Historical data from Season 1 shows ratings ranging from 8.0 to 9.3, and Season 2 so far has ranged from 6.1 to 9.6. This indicates a strong possibility of high ratings, particularly for season finales, which tend to attract significant attention and often receive favorable reviews if they conclude story arcs satisfactorily.\n   - Given the high ratings seen in both seasons, it is plausible that the finale could surpass the 8.5 threshold, especially if it is well-received by audiences.\n\n2. **M. Night Shyamalan's \"Trap\"**:\n   - Shyamalan's recent films have received CinemaScores ranging from C to B+. While his films can be polarizing, a B or higher is within the range of his past performances.\n   - CinemaScore tends to reflect audience satisfaction rather than critical reception, and a B is a moderate score that suggests reasonable satisfaction. Given Shyamalan's established fan base and the potential for a well-received film, achieving a B or higher is plausible.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, the probability of at least one of these events occurring is relatively high. Each has a realistic chance of happening based on historical data and typical audience reception patterns."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
