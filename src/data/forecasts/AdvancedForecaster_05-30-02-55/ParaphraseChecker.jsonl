This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. [...]\nBecause of the dramatic alteration of brain composition and the inherent risk that hemispherectomies pose, there are criteria that must be met in order for a person to qualify for the procedure. Criteria include no successful control of seizures throughout a variety of drug trials, and a reasonable to high chance of procedural success.\nOne such predictor of success is often the age of the patient.

[...]\nThe success of the procedure is not, however, limited to children. A study in 2007 indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades.

This surgery is almost exclusively performed on children because their brains generally exhibit more neuroplasticity, allowing neurons from the remaining hemisphere to take over the functions of the lost hemisphere. [...]\nHowever, the procedure's success is not limited to children. A 2007 study indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades. A 2015 case study of two adults aged 48 and 38 demonstrated the success of functional hemispherectomy in treating status epilepticus (SE), a condition where seizures are prolonged or occur in quick succession. In 2012, a case study of 30 adults who underwent some form of hemispherectomy found that 81% were seizure-free post-procedure. Additionally, almost all participants reported an improved quality of life. The conclusion: \u201cadult patients do not have to expect more problems with new deficits, appear to cope quite well, and most benefit from surgery in several quality of life domains.\u201d\nWhile hemispherectomies are generally reserved for extreme seizure disorder cases, they could theoretically assist in life extension. Specifically, a patient could voluntarily undergo a hemispherectomy to cryopreserve and store their brain long-term while still alive, thereby increasing the likelihood that their personality and identity are preserved in some medium, continuing into the future.\nAs far as I can tell, a hemispherectomy performed for life extension purposes is purely theoretical. Moreover, there are few to no current online resources discussing this possibility (besides this one).\nThis question asks, will an individual claim to have undergone a hemispherectomy for life extension purposes before the year 2100?\nHere, the resolution is determined by the conjunction of three actions performed by a single human:\nThey voluntarily underwent a hemispherectomy.\nHalf of their brain was placed in long-term cryopreservation while they were still legally alive.\nThey reported in a credible source (such as a media outlet or a forum with strong evidence of credibility) that the procedure was primarily for life extension purposes.\n", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.03}}, "violations": {"default": 0, "frequentist": 0.0}}
