This is influenced by Donald Trump's continued influence and popularity among Republican voters. \n\n**not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is the complementary probability to P. If I estimate P at 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30. \n\n**para_P (Possibility of Trump family member securing nomination)**: This is expected to be equal to P, as it essentially asks if it\u2019s possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, which is directly tied to P.\n\n**Q (At least 2\u02daC global warming by 2100)**: Considering the current trajectory of climate change and scientific consensus, I estimate a significant probability that there will be at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100. This is based on current climate models and observed trends.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will depend on the individual probabilities of P and Q. Since both events can occur independently, I will estimate this using the formula for joint probability, which suggests that P_and_Q should be less than or equal to both P and Q.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is calculated as the sum of the probabilities of P and Q minus the probability of both occurring (P_and_Q). This will be higher than either individual probability.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global warming and no Trump family member as nominee)**: This requires both Q to be true and not_P to be true. It is likely to be lower than both Q and not_P individually.\n\n**Q_given_P (Global warming given a Trump family member is a nominee)**: This is a conditional probability and will depend on the correlation between the two events. Given the current political climate, I would estimate this to be reasonably high as the nomination of a Trump family member does not inherently affect climate outcomes.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: P and Q are likely independent events, as the nomination of a Trump family member does not directly impact global warming. However, they are related in the context of the overall political and environmental landscape, which may influence public perception and policy decisions.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that my probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.70\nnot_P: 0.30\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.65\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.65 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.65 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.70, 0.65) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.65) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.65) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.45 / 0.60 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.70\nnot_P: 0.30\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.65\nP_and_Q: 0.42\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}, "Q_given_P": {"id": "5429bbb2-5c85-4e41-ae6f-5f386d7cb88c", "title": "Conditional on the United States recognizing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030, will Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for the condition: This question will resolve positively if before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that the United States of America has recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\n\nResolution Criteria for the outcome: This question will resolve positively if before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that Israel has recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.", "resolution_date": "2029-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.65, "elicitation_metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-15T20:21:25.640043", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('1957d09c-c557-4af8-b5e3-5b739878f067'), title='Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('357a65f5-7dbc-4a66-94a9-7d5a6e00d732'), title='Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7e55f25b-ae6c-44cb-a504-64fa405824a2'), title='Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if any of the following individuals becomes the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('51de109a-5230-438a-8938-a193f2cabc5a'), title='Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 \u02daC greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

Given Donald Trump's significant influence and support within the Republican Party, the probability is estimated at around 0.65. \n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary probability to P. Given the estimate for P, not_P is calculated as 1 - P, which results in approximately 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P**: Since para_P is essentially the same question as P but framed differently, it should have the same probability as P, which is 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The probability of experiencing at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is estimated at 0.70, considering current climate trends and scientific consensus on climate change.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: This probability needs to account for the likelihood of both P and Q occurring together. Assuming some independence, I estimate this at 0.65 (P) * 0.70 (Q) = 0.455.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: This probability is calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, it would be 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This probability estimates the scenario where global warming occurs, but no Trump family member is the nominee. It requires estimating the likelihood of Q happening without P. I estimate this at 0.70 (Q) * 0.35 (not_P), resulting in approximately 0.245.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability looks at the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee. Given the current climate trajectory, I would estimate this remains high, around 0.70.\n\nIn terms of consistency, I will ensure that the probabilities adhere to the rules outlined. The relationships between P and Q are crucial.

The relationship between these two events will be analyzed through various logical combinations, including their conjunction (P_and_Q), disjunction (P_or_Q), and conditional probabilities (Q_given_P).\n\n1. **P (Trump Family Nominee)**: I estimate a moderate probability that a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, given Donald Trump's prominence and the potential for family influence in the party. I would assign a probability of 0.65 to this event.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P, which would result in a probability of 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This is a similar question to P, so it should have the same probability estimate of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is influenced by current climate models and trends. Given the ongoing discussions around climate change and its impacts, I would estimate this probability at 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This is the probability that both P and Q occur. Given the independence of these two events, I would calculate this as P * Q, which gives us 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: The probability that either P or Q occurs can be found using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q, which would yield 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This probability estimates the scenario where global warming occurs, but a Trump family member is not the nominee.

Given Donald Trump's previous prominence and influence within the Republican Party, I assign a probability of 0.60. This reflects the potential for either Donald Trump or one of his children to be nominated.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: Since this is the direct negation of P, it should logically be 1 - P. Therefore, not_P is estimated at 0.40. This reflects the possibility that the Republican Party may choose a different candidate.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing nomination)**: Since this is a similar question to P, I assign the same probability (0.60) because if a Trump family member is nominated, it is indeed possible. \n\n4. **Q (At least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100)**: Considering the current climate trends and scientific consensus, I estimate a high probability of 0.75 that global warming will exceed 2\u02daC by 2100. This reflects the urgency and seriousness of climate change effects.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The likelihood that both a Trump family member is nominated and that global warming exceeds 2\u02daC is less than P and Q individually. I estimate this at 0.45, reflecting a moderate chance of both occurring simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability is higher than either P or Q alone. I estimate this at 0.85, as it accounts for the likelihood of either event happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global warming with no Trump nominee)**: I estimate this at 0.30, reflecting the chance that global warming occurs while no Trump family member is nominated.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global warming given Trump nominee)**: This conditional probability should be high, as the nomination of a Trump family member does not directly affect climate change predictions. I estimate this at 0.70, reflecting the belief that regardless of the political landscape, climate change will continue to be an issue.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "Q_given_P": {"id": "635788eb-e0e5-45fa-916f-92a7e0362590", "title": "Given US greenhouse gas emissions are halved by 2030, will commercial animal farming be prohibited in the US before 2041?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nThis question resolves positively if there is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO\u2082 equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources.

This estimate is based on the current political landscape, including Donald Trump's continued popularity within the Republican Party and the potential candidacy of other family members. \n\nFor not_P, which states that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee, I estimate a probability of 0.35. This reflects the possibility that other candidates may emerge as strong contenders, but I believe the Trump family's influence remains significant.\n\nThe para_P question, which asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, is closely related to P. I estimate this probability at 0.65, the same as P, since if P is true, para_P will inherently be true as well.\n\nAs for the question regarding global warming (Q), I estimate the probability at 0.40. This is based on current climate trends and scientific consensus indicating that significant warming is likely by 2100. \n\nThe joint probability of both events occurring (P_and_Q) is estimated at 0.26. This reflects the interaction between the two events, considering that political events and climate change can influence each other, but they are largely independent.\n\nFor the probability of either event occurring (P_or_Q), I estimate this at 0.75, which considers the combined likelihood of either scenario happening.\n\nThe probability of Q_and_not_P is estimated at 0.14, reflecting the likelihood of global warming occurring without a Trump family member being the nominee. \n\nLastly, for Q_given_P, I estimate a probability of 0.35, indicating that if a Trump family member is the nominee, the likelihood of global warming reaching 2\u02daC by 2100 is still significant, but slightly lower than the standalone Q probability due to potential political actions influencing climate policies.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"id": "d53ff2cc-4b73-426c-bcb9-e20f14eb4d20", "title": "If US greenhouse gas emissions are halved by 2030 and commercial animal farming is prohibited in the US before 2041, will Republicans hold the Senate from 2022 to 2030 if Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not admitted as new states?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for Condition:\nThis question resolves positively if both of the following occur:\n(a) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO\u2082 equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources.

Given the urgency of climate change and current trajectories, I estimate this probability to be moderate, reflecting ongoing debates and uncertainties in climate policy. \nP_and_Q: This probability reflects the joint occurrence of both events. If both the Trump family member is nominated and global warming occurs, this probability would be lower than either individual event due to the combined uncertainty. \nP_or_Q: This probability captures the likelihood that at least one of the two events occurs. It should be higher than either P or Q alone, but must still respect the probabilities of P and Q. \nQ_and_not_P: This reflects the situation where global warming occurs but no Trump family member is nominated. This probability is influenced by the same factors as Q and is likely to be higher if Q is high and P is low. \nQ_given_P: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is nominated.

The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.\n(b) The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.\n(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive).

Given the prominence of Donald Trump, his family members have a reasonable chance of being nominated, leading to a higher probability estimate. However, the dynamics of the Republican primaries and potential challengers could affect this.\n\nnot_P: This probability represents the opposite scenario, where none of the Trump family members secure the nomination. Given the current political landscape and Trump's significant influence within the Republican Party, this probability is likely lower than the probability of P.\n\npara_P: This question is closely related to P, as it essentially asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. If P is likely, then para_P should also have a high estimate.\n\nQ: The question of global warming reaching at least 2\u02daC by 2100 is a complex one, influenced by numerous environmental and policy factors. Current scientific consensus suggests that without significant intervention, this scenario is plausible, leading to a higher probability estimate for Q.\n\nP_and_Q: This probability combines the likelihood of both P and Q occurring. If both events are somewhat likely, then this combined probability will be lower than either individual probability due to the nature of conjunction (both must occur).\n\nP_or_Q: This probability accounts for the likelihood of either event occurring. Given that both P and Q have reasonable probabilities, this combined probability should be higher than either P or Q alone.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This probability examines the likelihood of global warming reaching 2\u02daC while no Trump family member is nominated. This scenario may be less likely, as political decisions can impact environmental policies, potentially affecting the outcome of Q.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability focuses on the likelihood of global warming reaching 2\u02daC, given that a Trump family member is the nominee.

This is based on the current political landscape and the popularity of Donald Trump within the Republican Party.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Member as Republican Nominee)**: Consequently, the probability of not having a Trump family member as the nominee is 0.35, which is complementary to P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump Family Member as Nominee)**: The probability of the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination is estimated to be the same as P, which is 0.65. It reflects the same underlying dynamics.\n\n4. **Q (At Least 2\u00b0C Global Warming by 2100)**: I estimate a probability of 0.70 for the occurrence of at least 2\u00b0C of global warming by 2100, given the current trajectory of climate change.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: The joint probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and at least 2\u00b0C of global warming is estimated at 0.45. This reflects a moderate correlation between political and environmental issues, as both can influence public policy.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: The probability of either event occurring is estimated at 0.85, which indicates a high likelihood that at least one of these scenarios will play out.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming with No Trump Nominee)**: The probability of experiencing at least 2\u00b0C of warming while not having a Trump family member as the nominee is estimated at 0.25. This reflects the idea that climate change is a broader issue than any individual political outcome.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: The conditional probability of at least 2\u00b0C of warming, given that a Trump family member is the nominee, is estimated at 0.60. This considers the potential influence of political leadership on climate policy.\n\n### Consistency with Rules:\n- **Negation Rule**: The estimates for P and not_P must sum to 1.

These events are independent of each other; the nomination of a Trump family member does not influence climate change predictions, and vice versa.\n\n### Probability Estimates\n1. **P (Trump nominee)**: I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for a Trump family member being the Republican nominee in 2024, considering the political landscape and Trump's continued influence within the party.\n\n2. **not_P**: This would be the complementary probability, which is 1 - P, leading to an estimate of 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is essentially the same as P, so I would also assign it a probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Global warming)**: I estimate a probability of 0.60 for there being at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, given current trends in climate data and projections from reputable sources.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: The likelihood of both P and Q occurring is more complex. Given that both events are independent, I can estimate this as P * Q, leading to an estimate of 0.39 (0.65 * 0.60).\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Plugging in the numbers gives us 0.86 (0.65 + 0.60 - 0.39).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question explores the scenario where global warming occurs but no Trump family member is nominated. Since P and Q are independent, this would be calculated as Q * not_P, leading to an estimate of 0.21 (0.60 * 0.35).\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of global warming is likely unchanged, so this would remain at 0.60.\n\n### Consistency with Rules\nI will ensure that these estimates obey the consistency rules provided:\n- The negation rule (not_P = 1 - P) will be checked.\n- The and/or rules will be applied to ensure that the combined probabilities make sense.\n- The independence of P and Q will help in calculating their joint and conditional probabilities.\n\nIn summary, the estimates will be carefully calculated to ensure they adhere to the rules of probability while reflecting the likelihood of these events occurring.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.86 + 0.39 - 0.60 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.86 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.86 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.60 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"id": "ab929ded-5b67-49c2-821f-3b05c75ac291", "title": "Conditional on both a new amendment to the US Constitution being ratified by 2050 and the United States continuing to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, will the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\n(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:\nThe US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992.

Given the prominence of Donald Trump and his family in the Republican Party, I believe there is a reasonable chance that a member of the Trump family could be the nominee. Therefore, I estimate the probability of P (a Trump family member being the nominee) to be relatively high.\n\nFor not_P, since it is the direct negation of P, I will calculate it as 1 - P. This ensures consistency between the two probabilities. \n\nThe question para_P is closely related to P and should have a similar probability, as it asks whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. I will set para_P to be equal to P.\n\nThe question regarding global warming (Q) is based on scientific consensus and predictions about climate change. Given the current trajectory of global temperatures and environmental policies, I will assign a moderate probability to this question, reflecting the uncertainty but also the likelihood of significant warming.\n\nThe P_and_Q question combines both events, so its probability should reflect the joint likelihood of both events occurring. If I estimate P to be high and Q to be moderate, I will set P_and_Q to a value that reflects a reasonable overlap of these two events.\n\nFor P_or_Q, I will calculate it based on the individual probabilities of P and Q while ensuring it adheres to the consistency rules. This will involve ensuring that the sum of the two probabilities does not exceed 1, adjusted for any overlap.\n\nThe Q_and_not_P question will require careful consideration of the relationship between Q and not_P. Since Q deals with global warming and not_P deals with the Trump family not being the nominee, I will need to assess their independence and adjust the probability accordingly.\n\nLastly, Q_given_P will require estimating the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee. This will likely require a moderate to high probability based on the current political climate and environmental policies that may arise from such a nomination.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that all probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, and Q.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"id": "98499ffc-5672-4025-8bfb-f446075fd989", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) a new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050, (b) the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index, and (c) the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\n(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:\nThe US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992.

Given the prominence of Donald Trump and his family, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for this event. \n\n**not_P**: The probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee is the complement of P, which I estimate to be 0.35. This reflects the possibility of other candidates emerging as strong contenders within the party. \n\n**para_P**: This probability is expected to be the same as P since it is essentially asking the same question in a different way. Thus, I will set this at 0.65 as well. \n\n**Q**: The question regarding global warming reaching at least 2\u02daC by 2100 is a complex one, influenced by numerous scientific studies and climate models. Given current trends, I estimate this probability to be around 0.60, reflecting a significant concern among scientists about climate change. \n\n**P_and_Q**: The joint probability that both a Trump family member will be the nominee and that there will be at least 2\u02daC of warming is likely lower than either individual probability due to the independence of these events. I estimate this at 0.30, reflecting the fact that while both events could happen, they are not directly correlated. \n\n**P_or_Q**: This probability should be higher than either individual event. I estimate it to be 0.85, as it captures the likelihood of at least one of the events occurring. \n\n**Q_and_not_P**: This refers to the scenario where global warming occurs, but no Trump family member is the nominee. Given the probabilities assigned, I estimate this at 0.20, as it combines the likelihood of global warming with the probability of the Trump family not being involved in the nomination. \n\n**Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee. I estimate this at 0.65, as the political climate may not significantly affect climate change predictions. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that my estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.30\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.30 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.30 / 0.65 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.30\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"id": "d6da75ab-5e5f-4d4a-a921-dbdc8ad23fd9", "title": "Conditional on both a fatality in North Korea due to an offensive nuclear detonation by 2030 and at least 100 deaths due to armed conflicts between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China by 2026, will the United States drop below a 7 in the Democracy index by 2040?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following conditions are met:\n(a) At least one offensive nuclear detonation occurs anywhere on Earth between January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2030, and this detonation causes at least one fatality in North Korea.

The Trump family has significant political influence, and Donald Trump remains a prominent figure in the Republican Party. However, there are uncertainties regarding intra-party dynamics and potential challengers.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P, so I estimate it at 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing nomination)**: Since this is essentially the same as P, I will set this at 0.60 as well. \n\n4. **Q (At least 2\u00b0C global warming by 2100)**: Given the current trends in climate change and scientific consensus, I would estimate this probability at around 0.70. The evidence suggests we are on a trajectory that could lead to significant warming unless substantial action is taken.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability should be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be true. A reasonable estimate might be around 0.42, reflecting the joint occurrence of these probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This should be higher than either P or Q alone. Given the estimates, I might set this at around 0.80, which reflects the likelihood of at least one of these events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global warming and no Trump family nominee)**: This requires both conditions to be true, and I would estimate this at around 0.28, reflecting the intersection of these two probabilities.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global warming given a Trump nominee)**: This conditional probability might be slightly higher than Q alone, given the potential for political action on climate policy by the nominee. I estimate this at about 0.75.\n\nIn summary, while P and Q are not directly dependent on each other, their relationship through the combined questions creates a complex web of probabilities that must adhere to the consistency rules. I will ensure that all estimates respect the mathematical relationships outlined in the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.42\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.42 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.56\nnot_P: 0.44\npara_P: 0.56\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.56", "steps": 6}}}}

Given the prominence of the Trump family in American politics, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the complementary event to P. If P is moderately high, then not_P must be lower. The relationship between these two is clear and straightforward; they should sum to 1. Therefore, if I estimate P at 0.65, not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This question is similar to P and should logically have a similar probability estimate because if it is possible for a Trump family member to be nominated, it aligns closely with the probability of them actually being nominated. Thus, I expect para_P to be around the same value as P.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming by 2100)**: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is based on current climate trends and scientific consensus. Given the ongoing climate change discussions and data, I estimate this probability to be significant, perhaps around 0.7.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: This probability should be lower than either P or Q alone since it requires both conditions to be true. I estimate this probability conservatively, perhaps around 0.45, considering the interdependence of these two events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: This should be higher than either P or Q alone, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these events will occur. I expect this to be around 0.85, as it encompasses a broader range of possibilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming with No Trump Nominee)**: This probability reflects a specific intersection of events. If Q is likely to occur, but P is not, I estimate this to be lower than Q alone, perhaps around 0.25.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming if a Trump family member is the nominee. Given the political implications of climate policy under a Trump administration, I expect this to be slightly lower than Q alone, perhaps around 0.65.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**:\n- P and not_P are perfectly complementary.\n- P and para_P are closely related and should reflect similar probabilities.\n- Q and P are independent; one does not influence the other directly, but their intersection (P_and_Q) reflects a more specific scenario.\n- The relationships among the probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules, ensuring that they do not contradict one another.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.65 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q_given_P": {"id": "597265e9-dd60-473c-9fc2-f23c9cf5c34a", "title": "If nuclear conflict occurs by 2030 and it starts in the period June-September, will US life expectancy at birth for both sexes fall below 75 years before 2040?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: If nuclear conflict occurs by 2030, it will start in the period June-September.

Given Donald Trump's significant influence within the Republican Party and the possibility of his family members running, such as Donald Trump Jr. or Ivanka Trump, I believe it is plausible that one of them could be the nominee.\n\n### not_P: Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis is the complement of P, so I estimate this probability at 0.35. This reflects the uncertainty surrounding the Republican nomination process and acknowledges the potential for other candidates to emerge.\n\n### para_P: Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis is closely related to P, and since I believe there is a good chance of a Trump family member being nominated, I estimate this probability at 0.65 as well.\n\n### Q: Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\nGiven current climate trends and predictions from climate scientists, I estimate a probability of 0.70 for this event. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events and rising global temperatures support this estimate.\n\n### P_and_Q: Will both a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee and there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\nThis probability will be lower than either P or Q alone due to the conjunction. I estimate it at 0.45, as it combines two independent events that may not necessarily influence each other directly.\n\n### P_or_Q: Will either a Trump family member be the nominee or there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming?\nThis probability should be higher than both P and Q individually, so I estimate it at 0.80, considering the likelihood of either scenario occurring.\n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming and no Trump family member be the nominee?\nThis probability should be lower than Q but also needs to consider the likelihood of not P. I estimate it at 0.25, acknowledging that while climate change is a significant concern, the political landscape is also very dynamic.\n\n### Q_given_P: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming?\nThis is a conditional probability, and I estimate it at 0.70, reflecting the belief that regardless of political circumstances, climate change remains a pressing issue.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"id": "320740b0-e579-40af-9cb8-f26e50f92285", "title": "Given both of the following: (a) If nuclear conflict occurs by 2030, will it start in the period June-September?

Historical trends and current political sentiments support this, leading to an estimate of around 0.65.\n\n**not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P, so I expect it to be around 0.35. \n\n**para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination)**: This probability should be similar to P, as it essentially asks if it's possible. I estimate this at 0.65 as well.\n\n**Q (At least 2\u00b0C global warming by 2100)**: Considering current scientific consensus and climate data, I estimate a higher probability of this event occurring, around 0.75. \n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be true. I estimate this at around 0.50, assuming some correlation between political actions and climate policies.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than both P and Q alone. I estimate this at around 0.85, considering that at least one of these two events is likely to happen.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global warming occurs while no Trump family member is nominated)**: This scenario is plausible, so I estimate it at around 0.20, factoring in the independence of these events.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given a Trump family nominee, will there be at least 2\u00b0C of warming?)**: Given the political climate and potential policies that could be enacted, I estimate this at around 0.70, reflecting a belief that climate change will continue to be a pressing issue regardless of political nominations.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.70 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_cond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"id": "62f986b7-8c04-4820-bd52-51d39d109d78", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) If nuclear conflict occurs by 2030, will it start in the period June-September?

It is expected to be similar to P since it encompasses the same individuals but allows for any member to be the nominee.\n\nQ: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is influenced by current climate trends, scientific predictions, and policy responses to climate change. Given the current trajectory of global warming, I estimate a moderate probability for this event.\n\nP_and_Q: This event requires both P and Q to be true. The likelihood of this occurring would depend on the interdependence of political dynamics and climate change policies. If a Trump family member is nominated, their policies could influence climate change outcomes, affecting this probability.\n\nP_or_Q: This event requires either P or Q to occur. Since both events are significant in their own right, the probability should be higher than that of either event alone, but not excessively so due to the potential for independence.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This event reflects the scenario where climate change occurs without a Trump family member being the nominee. This could happen if climate change trends continue regardless of political nominations, suggesting a moderate probability.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of climate change occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee. This could be influenced by the policies that the nominee advocates, which could either exacerbate or mitigate climate change.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.55\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.40 - 0.55 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.50 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\npara consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.68\nnot_P: 0.32\npara_P: 0.68\nQ: 0.55\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.68", "steps": 6}}}}
