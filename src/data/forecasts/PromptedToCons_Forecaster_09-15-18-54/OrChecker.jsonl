Given Donald Trump's prominence and the potential support for his family members, I estimate a moderate probability that one of them will secure the nomination. \n\nnot_P: This probability reflects the possibility that none of the Trump family members will be the nominee. Factors such as strong competition from other candidates or shifting political dynamics could lead to this outcome, hence a reasonable estimate is provided. \n\npara_P: This probability assesses the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination, which aligns closely with P. If P is true, then para_P should also reflect a similar probability since they are essentially asking about the same event. \n\nQ: The likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a significant concern based on current climate data and projections. Given the trends observed in global temperatures and climate change models, I estimate a moderate to high probability for this event. \n\nP_and_Q: This probability combines the likelihood of both events occurring simultaneously. Given that both events (Trump family member nomination and global warming) could independently occur, the combined probability is lower than the individual probabilities of P and Q. \n\nP_or_Q: This probability captures the likelihood of either event occurring. Since both events are not mutually exclusive, the probability is higher than that of P and Q individually. \n\nQ_and_not_P: This reflects the scenario where global warming occurs while no Trump family member is nominated. This situation could be plausible, and thus a moderate estimate is provided. \n\nQ_given_P: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of global warming reaching 2\u02daC is likely influenced by external factors, but it remains high based on current trends. \n\nOverall, the questions are interrelated, particularly between P and Q. The outcomes of one could indirectly influence perceptions of the other, particularly in a political context where climate change policies are debated.

Given Donald Trump's prominence in politics and the potential influence of his family, I assign a probability of 0.65. \n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Conversely, if I assign a probability of 0.65 to P, then not_P should be 0.35, as it is the complement of P. This is consistent with the idea that while there is a chance of a Trump family member being nominated, there are also significant other candidates in the Republican Party. \n\n**para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: Since para_P is essentially the same as P in terms of the probability of a Trump family member securing the nomination, I will assign it the same probability of 0.65. \n\n**Q (Global Warming)**: The question of whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is complex. Given current climate models and trends, I estimate a probability of 0.60 that this will occur. This reflects the scientific consensus on the trajectory of global temperatures if current policies and trends continue. \n\n**P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: For P_and_Q, the probability that both a Trump family member is nominated and there will be significant global warming is likely lower than either event occurring independently. I estimate this probability at 0.39, reflecting the joint occurrence of both events. \n\n**P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: P_or_Q should be higher than both individual probabilities. I estimate this at 0.76, indicating that at least one of these events is quite likely to occur. \n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global Warming and No Trump Nominee)**: The probability that there will be significant global warming while no Trump family member is nominated is estimated at 0.21. This reflects the independence of these two events, as one does not affect the other significantly. \n\n**Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: The probability of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee should be similar to Q, as the political landscape does not directly influence climate change.

Therefore, I would estimate the probability of P (a member of the Trump family being the nominee) to be relatively high, around 0.65. Consequently, the probability of not_P (no member of the Trump family being the nominee) would be 1 - P, which would be 0.35.\n\nThe question para_P is closely related to P, and since it essentially asks the same thing, I would assign it the same probability of 0.65. \n\nAs for Q (global warming of at least 2\u00b0C by 2100), I would estimate this probability to be around 0.60, given the current trends and scientific consensus on climate change. \n\nThe probabilities for P_and_Q (both events occurring) will depend on the independence of the two events. Given the political context, I believe they are somewhat independent, but there could be some correlation due to environmental policies influenced by political leadership. Therefore, I would estimate P_and_Q to be lower than the individual probabilities, around 0.40.\n\nFor P_or_Q, since it's the occurrence of either event, I would calculate it using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. This would result in approximately 0.65 + 0.60 - 0.40 = 0.85.\n\nQ_and_not_P would be the probability that global warming occurs while no Trump family member is nominated. Assuming some correlation, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.25.\n\nLastly, Q_given_P would assess the likelihood of global warming if a Trump family member is the nominee. Given the potential for environmental policy shifts, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.40 - 0.60 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

This is influenced by Trump's continued popularity among the Republican base and the political landscape leading up to the 2024 election.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. This reflects a belief that while there are alternatives, the Trump family remains a strong contender.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump family member securing nomination)**: This is closely related to P and is likely to have a similar probability. Since it's asking about the possibility rather than certainty, I would estimate it slightly higher, possibly around 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (At least 2\u02daC global warming by 2100)**: Based on current climate models and trends, I believe there is a significant chance of reaching this threshold, especially given the trajectory of carbon emissions. I would estimate this probability at around 0.60.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be true. I would estimate this at around 0.40, considering the independence of the events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone. I would estimate it at around 0.75, as it's quite likely that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global warming occurs, but no Trump family member is nominee)**: This is a more specific scenario and would likely have a lower probability, perhaps around 0.30, since it requires both conditions to be met.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Trump family member is nominee, will there be global warming)**: This is a conditional probability and might be slightly higher than Q alone due to the potential for increased environmental policies under a Trump administration. I would estimate this at around 0.65.\n\nOverall, I am considering the political landscape and climate science to derive these probabilities, ensuring they respect the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.65 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\npara consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q": {"id": "4a5836cd-fb33-466b-a35f-1271662dacc1", "title": "Will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\nThe Insurrection Act is invoked.\nWhile the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\nAll of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\nFine Print\nAny conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

I would assign a probability of 0.65 to P. Consequently, the probability of no member of the Trump family being the nominee (not_P) would be 0.35, as these probabilities must sum to 1.\n\nThe question about whether it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination (para_P) should align with the probability of P, so I would also set para_P at 0.65.\n\nFor the global warming question (Q), considering current scientific consensus and trends, I would estimate a probability of 0.60 for there being at least 2\u00b0C of global warming by 2100. This reflects the increasing evidence of climate change impacts.\n\nThe joint probability of both P and Q occurring (P_and_Q) should be the product of the individual probabilities since they are not directly dependent on each other. Therefore, I would estimate P_and_Q as 0.65 * 0.60 = 0.39.\n\nFor the probability of either P or Q occurring (P_or_Q), I would apply the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, leading to 0.65 + 0.60 - 0.39 = 0.86.\n\nThe question about Q and not P (Q_and_not_P) would be trickier, but I would estimate it to be 0.60 * 0.35 = 0.21, assuming that the occurrence of global warming does not depend on the Trump nomination.\n\nFinally, for the conditional probability (Q_given_P), I would consider that if a Trump family member is the nominee, it might slightly increase the likelihood of climate-related policies being discussed, but not significantly. Thus, I might estimate it around 0.55.\n\nOverall, I would ensure that all these probabilities align with the consistency rules provided, particularly checking that they sum correctly and fall within the appropriate ranges.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.86 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.86 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.86 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.55 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.36\nP_or_Q: 0.84\nQ_and_not_P: 0.24\nQ_given_P: 0.54\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "7a655879-427c-44f8-b34f-99bc45d39ca4", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120, or (b) the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?", "body": "(a) Will there be a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120?\nResolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\nFine Print\nWe'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\n\n(b) Will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?\nResolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\nThe Insurrection Act is invoked.\nWhile the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\nAll of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\nFine Print\nAny conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

However, considering the potential for other candidates to emerge, I will set this at 0.65.\n\n**not_P (Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This is the complement of P, and thus can be calculated as 1 - P, resulting in 0.35.\n\n**para_P (Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I will also set this at 0.65.\n\n**Q (Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: Given current climate models and trends, there is a significant probability that we will see at least this level of warming by 2100. I will estimate this at 0.75.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both of the following occur: a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, and there is at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: The occurrence of both P and Q is somewhat dependent. If P occurs, it does not directly influence Q, but both can occur independently. I will set this probability at 0.50, reflecting a moderate likelihood of both events happening together.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either of the following occur: A member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, or there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: Given the independent nature of P and Q, this probability can be estimated using the formula for the union of two events: P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, this will be 0.65 + 0.75 - 0.50 = 0.90.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will both of the following occur: There will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, and no member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This scenario is also dependent. If Q occurs, it does not necessarily mean that not_P will occur, but they can both happen together. I will estimate this at 0.25.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given that a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: This conditional probability is likely to reflect the overall probability of Q, as the events are independent.

Given Donald Trump's prominence in the party and the potential for family members to run, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\nnot_P: Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee is dependent on the emergence of other candidates and the overall party dynamics. Given the current political climate, I estimate this to be lower than P but still significant.\n\npara_P: This probability reflects the possibility that a Trump family member could secure the nomination, which is closely tied to the probability of P. Since P is relatively high, para_P will be similar.\n\nQ: The question of whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is based on scientific consensus and climate models. Given current trends in climate change, I estimate this probability to be significant.\n\nP_and_Q: This is the joint probability that both events occur. Since both P and Q have significant probabilities, I would estimate this to be lower than either P or Q individually, as both conditions must be met.\n\nP_or_Q: This probability represents the likelihood that at least one of the events occurs. Given that both P and Q are reasonably likely, I would expect this probability to be high.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This probability reflects the occurrence of global warming without a Trump family member as the nominee. This situation could happen if other candidates emerge, but it is less likely than P_and_Q, as Q is still significant.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability estimates the likelihood of global warming given that a Trump family member is the nominee.

Given the prominence of Donald Trump and his family's involvement in politics, I estimate a moderate to high probability of this event occurring, say 0.60.\n\nnot_P: The probability estimate for not_P, meaning no member of the Trump family will be the nominee, is directly related to the estimate for P. Since the two events are mutually exclusive, not_P would be 1 - P, resulting in 0.40.\n\npara_P: The probability of para_P, which is whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, would logically align with P. If P has a probability of 0.60, then para_P should also be around the same value, as the possibility of an event occurring is often tied to its actual likelihood. Thus, I estimate para_P to be 0.60 as well.\n\nQ: For Q, which asks if there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, I would consider scientific consensus and current climate change models. Given the trajectory of global warming and the urgency of climate change discussions, a probability estimate of 0.75 seems reasonable.\n\nP_and_Q: The joint probability P_and_Q, which considers both a Trump family member being the nominee and significant global warming, would depend on the independence of these events. They may not be entirely independent, but for estimation, I could use the product of P and Q, resulting in 0.60 * 0.75 = 0.45.\n\nP_or_Q: The probability for P_or_Q, which is either event occurring, can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, it would be 0.60 + 0.75 - 0.45 = 0.90.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This event considers the occurrence of global warming while no Trump family member is the nominee. Assuming some independence, I would estimate Q_and_not_P as Q * not_P, giving 0.75 * 0.40 = 0.30.\n\nQ_given_P: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of global warming by 2100 would remain largely unchanged, so I might estimate this to be around 0.75 as well.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.90 + 0.45 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.90 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

Given Donald Trump's prominence and the potential candidacy of other family members, I estimate a moderately high probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is the complement of P. The probability of this event must be consistent with P, hence if P is estimated at a certain value, not_P will be 1 minus that value.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination)**: This is essentially the same event as P, so I expect this probability to align closely with P's estimate.\n\n4. **Q (At least 2\u02daC global warming by 2100)**: This event is based on scientific projections of climate change. Given the current trajectory of global warming, I estimate a moderate probability that we will see at least 2\u02daC of warming by the end of the century.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: This event requires both P and Q to be true. The probability of this happening would be influenced by the independence of the two events. If P and Q are somewhat independent, I can estimate this probability as a product of the individual probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: This is a logical OR operation. The probability of this event would be the sum of the probabilities of P and Q minus the probability of both occurring together (P_and_Q). This ensures that I do not double-count the scenario where both events occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not P)**: This event will require that global warming occurs while no Trump family member is the nominee. This is a more complex relationship that might need careful estimation based on the probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P is true)**: This conditional probability will depend on the relationship between the nomination of a Trump family member and global warming. If I think that the nomination might influence climate policies, I might adjust this probability accordingly.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that my probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between these events and their logical implications.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.50\nP_and_Q: 0.32\nP_or_Q: 0.83\nQ_and_not_P: 0.18\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.83 + 0.32 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.32 <= min(0.65, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.50) <= 0.83 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.83 - 0.18 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.32 / 0.50 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.50\nP_and_Q: 0.32\nP_or_Q: 0.83\nQ_and_not_P: 0.18\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "9d7633a4-d4df-4fa2-8e8f-47c3948b5695", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Starlink conduct an IPO before 2030?

This is based on the popularity of Donald Trump and the possible candidacy of his children. \n\n**not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This probability is therefore 0.35 (1 - P), reflecting the possibility that none of the Trump family members will secure the nomination.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing nomination)**: This is logically the same as P, so I estimate it at 0.65 as well.\n\n**Q (At least 2\u02daC global warming by 2100)**: I assign a probability of 0.70 for there being at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, based on current climate models and trends.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and global warming reaching at least 2\u02daC is estimated at 0.45. This is calculated as a product of the two probabilities, considering they may not be entirely independent but still have a reasonable chance of occurring together.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This is calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, I estimate this at 0.90, indicating a high likelihood that at least one of these events will happen.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global warming and no Trump nominee)**: I estimate this at 0.25, reflecting the scenario where global warming occurs but no Trump family member is the nominee.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given a Trump nominee, will there be global warming)**: I estimate this at 0.75, indicating that if a Trump family member is the nominee, there is still a strong likelihood of global warming occurring.\n\n**Consistency Check**: I will ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, such as the negation rule, and the rules governing conjunctions and disjunctions. \n\nIn summary, I expect the estimates to align with the logical relationships between these events, while also reflecting the current political and environmental landscape.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.90 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.90 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
