This is based on the current political climate, the popularity of Donald Trump within the Republican Party, and the potential for other family members to run as well.\n\n2. **not_P**: The probability for no member of the Trump family being the nominee is then 0.40, which is simply 1 - P. This is consistent with the first estimate.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is slightly different in wording but essentially addresses the same event as P. I will assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: For the question of whether there will be at least 2\u00b0C of global warming by 2100, I estimate a probability of 0.70. This is based on current climate models and trends showing significant warming is likely if no major interventions occur.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: The joint probability of both P and Q occurring will depend on the independence of these events. Given that political nominations and climate change are generally independent, I estimate P_and_Q as 0.42 (0.60 * 0.70).\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: The probability of either P or Q occurring can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. So, P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.70 - 0.42 = 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This probability estimates the chance of global warming occurring while no Trump family member is the nominee. Given the probabilities assigned, I estimate this at 0.28 (0.70 * 0.40).\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee. I will estimate this at 0.75, reflecting a belief that political dynamics could influence climate policy, but not significantly enough to change the overall trend. \n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are complex, but the independence of political events from climate change allows me to assign these probabilities while maintaining consistency with the rules provided.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.42\nP_or_Q: 0.88\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.88 + 0.42 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.88 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.88 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.42\nP_or_Q: 0.88\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

Given Donald Trump's prominence and the potential candidacy of his family members, I believe there is a reasonable chance for this event. This leads me to assign a probability of around 0.65 to this event.\n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P should be 0.35. This is a straightforward calculation based on the negation rule.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nomination)**: This is closely related to P and should have a similar probability. Therefore, I estimate para_P to also be 0.65.\n\n**Q (Global Warming)**: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a complex prediction that depends on various factors, including current trends in climate change. Given the urgency of climate action and the scientific consensus on ongoing warming, I estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: This probability should reflect the likelihood of both events occurring simultaneously. If I assume some level of independence between P and Q, I can calculate this as P * Q, which would be 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\n**P_or_Q (At Least One Event Occurring)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global Warming Occurs, No Trump Nominee)**: This probability reflects the scenario where global warming occurs, but no Trump family member is nominated. If I assume some independence, I can estimate this as Q * not_P = 0.70 * 0.35 = 0.245.\n\n**Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nomination)**: This is a conditional probability that reflects whether global warming will occur given that a Trump family member is the nominee. Given the urgency of climate change, I might estimate this to be similar to Q, so I could set it at 0.70.\n\n**Consistency Checks**: I will ensure that all these estimates comply with the consistency rules provided.

Given Donald Trump's significant political presence and the potential for his family members to be candidates, I would estimate a relatively high probability for this event. \n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the direct negation of P. Given the estimation for P, not_P will have a complementary probability. If P is high, not_P will be low.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This question essentially asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given that P is estimated to be high, the probability for para_P should match P, as the possibility is directly tied to the likelihood of P occurring.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: This question examines the probability of at least 2\u00b0C of global warming by 2100. Given the current scientific consensus on climate change, I would estimate a moderate to high probability for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: This question depends on both P and Q being true. The probability here should reflect the joint occurrence of both events, which may be lower than either individual probability due to potential independence.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: This question allows for the occurrence of either P or Q. The probability for this should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses both scenarios.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming with No Trump Nominee)**: This question examines the scenario where global warming occurs, but no Trump family member is the nominee. The probability would depend on the individual probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: This conditional question examines the likelihood of global warming occurring if a Trump family member is the nominee. This probability may be influenced by the political climate and policies associated with Trump family members, potentially affecting the estimate.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these questions indicate a complex interplay of political and environmental factors. The consistency rules will guide the probability estimates to ensure they align logically and mathematically.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "para_P": {"id": "07c43859-579b-49f6-b577-ffdf38f00e13", "title": "Is it expected that the Forethought Foundation will employ over two full-time equivalent staff members by 2025?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nIn this context, a full-time equivalent is considered to be someone working 35 hours per week, excluding volunteers.

Given the prominence of Donald Trump and the possibility of his family members running, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.65.\n\nnot_P: Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee is influenced by the same factors but reflects a different outcome. This probability is likely to be lower than P, so I estimate it at around 0.35.\n\npara_P: The probability that it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination is closely related to P, and I estimate it to be the same at 0.65, as it reflects the same conditions.\n\nQ: The question of whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a more complex issue, dependent on climate models, current trends, and international policy responses. I estimate this probability to be around 0.60, given the current trajectory of climate change.\n\nP_and_Q: The joint probability of both P and Q occurring requires both a Trump family member to be nominated and significant global warming. Since these events can be seen as somewhat independent, I estimate this probability to be 0.40, reflecting a moderate likelihood of both happening.\n\nP_or_Q: The probability of either P or Q occurring is higher than the individual probabilities, as it encompasses both scenarios. I estimate this at 0.75, as either event occurring is plausible.\n\nQ_and_not_P: The probability that there will be at least 2\u02daC of warming while no Trump family member is nominated is also a consideration. I estimate this at 0.25, as it reflects a scenario where climate change occurs without the Trump family's involvement in the nomination.\n\nQ_given_P: If we assume that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100 may be influenced by political decisions made during their campaign.

This estimate is based on the current political landscape, the popularity of Donald Trump, and the potential candidacies of his family members. Factors that could influence this probability include the political climate closer to the election, public opinion, and the emergence of other strong candidates within the Republican party.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Consequently, I estimate the probability of not_P to be 0.40. This reflects the possibility that another candidate may emerge as a strong contender or that the Trump family may choose not to run.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: The probability for para_P is set at 0.60, aligning with P, since if there is a possibility of a Trump family member being nominated, it should be equal to the probability of that event happening.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: I estimate a probability of 0.70 for Q, suggesting that there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100. This estimate is based on current climate models and trends indicating rising global temperatures and the potential for significant climate change impacts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: I estimate the probability of P_and_Q to be 0.42, which reflects the joint probability of both events occurring. This is calculated considering the probabilities of P and Q and their potential dependence on each other.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: The probability for P_or_Q is estimated at 0.88, indicating a high likelihood that at least one of the two events will occur. This is derived from the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming and No Trump Nominee)**: For Q_and_not_P, I estimate a probability of 0.28, which indicates the likelihood of global warming occurring while no member of the Trump family is the nominee. This probability reflects the independence of these two events, as climate change is largely driven by global factors unrelated to individual political nominations.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: The probability of Q_given_P is set at 0.75, suggesting that if a member of the Trump family is the nominee, there is still a significant chance of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100. This reflects the understanding that political outcomes do not directly influence climate change but acknowledges the potential for policy decisions related to climate under a Trump administration.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.42\nP_or_Q: 0.88\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.88 + 0.42 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.88 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.88 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.42\nP_or_Q: 0.88\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "para_P": {"id": "409f3acb-dd34-43aa-ac94-16994e982321", "title": "Should Joe Biden win the 2020 US presidential election, will the top tax rate be raised to 39.6% or more by 2025?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Joe Biden wins the 2020 presidential election and the highest tax rate for single taxpayers in the US is increased to at least 39.6% by January 1, 2025.

This is based on Donald Trump's continued influence within the party, as well as the possibility of his children or other family members stepping into the spotlight, especially if he chooses not to run himself. \n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Consequently, the probability of no member of the Trump family being the nominee is 0.35. This reflects the uncertainty around the political landscape and the potential for other candidates to emerge.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of a Trump Family Member as Nominee)**: This is closely aligned with P, so I estimate it at 0.65 as well, given that if P is true, then para_P must also be true.\n\n**Q (Global Warming)**: For global warming, I estimate a probability of 0.70 that there will be at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100. This is based on current climate models and trends showing a significant rise in temperatures if current emissions trajectories continue.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: I estimate a probability of 0.45 that both a Trump family member will be the nominee and that there will be significant global warming. This reflects the independent nature of these events, but also acknowledges that political decisions could influence environmental policies.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: Given the estimates above, I would place the probability of either event occurring at 0.85. This high probability reflects the strong likelihood of at least one of these events happening.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global Warming with No Trump Nominee)**: I estimate this probability at 0.25, reflecting the possibility of significant climate change occurring regardless of the political nominee.\n\n**Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: I would estimate this at 0.75, as the presence of a Trump nominee could lead to policies that either accelerate or mitigate climate change, but overall, the trend is towards warming regardless of political leadership.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these probabilities should adhere to the consistency rules set forth: the negation of P should equal not_P, the conditions for and/or events should hold, and the conditional probabilities should reflect the relationships accurately.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\n{failed_check_cond}\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.42\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

Given the current political landscape, I estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.65.\n\n**not_P**: This is the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, reflecting the possibility that none of the Trump family members secure the nomination.\n\n**para_P**: This question is similar to P and should have the same probability since it essentially asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Therefore, I estimate para_P to also be 0.65.\n\n**Q**: The likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is based on current climate models and trends. Given the urgency of climate change and the trajectory of global emissions, I estimate this probability to be around 0.75.\n\n**P_and_Q**: This probability represents the likelihood that both events occur simultaneously. Given the high probability of Q and a moderate probability of P, I estimate P_and_Q to be around 0.50, assuming some correlation between political actions regarding climate policy and the nomination process.\n\n**P_or_Q**: This probability can be calculated using the rule of addition. Since both P and Q are relatively high, I estimate this to be around 0.85, indicating a strong likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P**: This represents the scenario where there is significant global warming, but no Trump family member is the nominee. Given the probabilities, I estimate this to be around 0.25, as it is plausible that climate change persists regardless of political nominations.\n\n**Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee. Given the political stance of the Trump family on climate issues, I estimate this probability to be lower, around 0.60.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these probabilities are interdependent, particularly between P and Q, as political decisions can influence climate policies and vice versa.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.60 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.58\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "para_P": {"id": "2b3139fd-4f28-4cca-9494-e16ec34bbdbf", "title": "Will the rates of smoking and sexual activity be lower in the United States in 2050 compared to 2021?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if any credible surveys of US adults in the year 2050 report that the percentage of adults who have smoked in the past week and the percentage of adults who have had sex in the past week were both lower than in the year 2021.

However, different methodologies can still be acceptable if it can be logically deduced that the surveys provide evidence toward resolution. For example, if a survey in 2021 asked whether respondents had sex in the past year and 25% answered no, and a survey in 2050 asked if respondents had sex in the past five years and 40% answered no, it can be deduced that a larger share of adults in 2050 had not had sex in the past year than in 2021 because the five year period would include the past year.\n", "resolution_date": "2050-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.65, "elicitation_metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-15T20:20:01.009515", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('1957d09c-c557-4af8-b5e3-5b739878f067'), title='Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('357a65f5-7dbc-4a66-94a9-7d5a6e00d732'), title='Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7e55f25b-ae6c-44cb-a504-64fa405824a2'), title='Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if any of the following individuals becomes the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('51de109a-5230-438a-8938-a193f2cabc5a'), title='Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 \u02daC greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

Each question has a binary resolution, meaning they will either resolve positively (YES) or negatively (NO).\n\n### P (Trump Family Nominee)\nI estimate a moderate probability for P, the event that a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. Given Donald Trump's prominence in the Republican Party and the potential for his family members to be involved, I assign a probability of around 0.65. This reflects the likelihood of one of the Trump family members securing the nomination.\n\n### not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)\nSince not_P is the direct negation of P, I assign it a probability of 0.35. This reflects the possibility that a member of the Trump family will not be the nominee, acknowledging the competitive nature of the Republican primaries and the potential for other candidates to emerge.\n\n### para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)\nGiven that para_P is a parallel question to P, it carries the same probability estimate of 0.65. It essentially asks if it's possible for any Trump family member to secure the nomination, which aligns with the estimates for P.\n\n### Q (Global Warming)\nFor Q, regarding the likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, I assign a probability of 0.70. The scientific consensus indicates that we are on a path toward significant warming unless substantial measures are taken to mitigate climate change.\n\n### P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)\nConsidering both P and Q, I estimate a lower probability of 0.45 for P_and_Q. This reflects the likelihood that both a Trump family member will be the nominee and that global warming will exceed 2\u02daC. These events are not entirely independent, as political decisions regarding climate policy could influence the global warming outcome.\n\n### P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)\nFor P_or_Q, I estimate a probability of 0.85, suggesting a high likelihood that at least one of these events will occur. The events are somewhat correlated, as the political landscape could impact climate policy and vice versa.\n\n### Q_and_not_P (Global Warming and No Trump Nominee)\nFor Q_and_not_P, I estimate a probability of 0.25. This reflects the likelihood that global warming will exceed 2\u02daC while no Trump family member is the nominee, which is plausible but less likely compared to scenarios where a Trump family member is involved.\n\n### Q_given_P (Given Trump Nominee, Global Warming)\nFor Q_given_P, I estimate a probability of 0.60. This reflects the likelihood of global warming exceeding 2\u02daC given that a Trump family member is the nominee. The political stance of the nominee could influence climate policies, thus impacting this probability.\n\n### Consistency with Rules\nI will ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided. The relationships between the probabilities, particularly regarding negation and conjunctions, will be checked to make sure they hold true mathematically. The relationship between P and Q is also critical, as they may influence each other, especially in terms of policy and public perception.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
