Given that Donald Trump has a strong base of support, I estimate this probability to be relatively high.\n\nnot_P: This is the complementary probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee. If the political landscape shifts significantly, or if another candidate emerges with stronger support, this probability could increase. However, given the current political dynamics, I believe this probability is lower than that of P.\n\npara_P: This probability is expected to align closely with P since it addresses the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination. Thus, it should be similar to P's estimate.\n\nQ: The question of whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is based on scientific consensus and current trends in climate change. Given the trajectory of global temperatures and the urgency of addressing climate change, I estimate this probability to be moderate.\n\nP_and_Q: This probability represents the likelihood of both events occurring. It is inherently lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires the simultaneous occurrence of both conditions. I would estimate this to be a fraction of the probabilities of P and Q.\n\nP_or_Q: This probability indicates that at least one of the two conditions will be met. It should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it captures the possibility of either event occurring.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This probability focuses on the occurrence of global warming while excluding the Trump family from the nomination. This can be influenced by independent factors, and I would estimate it to be lower than Q alone but higher than the intersection of Q and P.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming occurring, given that a Trump family member is the nominee.

Given current trends and projections, I would estimate this probability to be moderate, reflecting ongoing climate change impacts.\n\nP_and_Q: The joint probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and global warming reaching 2\u02daC is expected to be lower than either individual probability, as these events are not directly correlated but are affected by separate factors.\n\nP_or_Q: The probability that either event occurs (a Trump family member as nominee or global warming reaching 2\u02daC) should be higher than the individual probabilities of each event, as it captures more potential outcomes.\n\nQ_and_not_P: The probability of global warming reaching 2\u02daC while no Trump family member is nominated is a combination of Q and not_P, likely resulting in a moderate estimate due to the independence of these events.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability examines the likelihood of global warming reaching 2\u02daC, given that a Trump family member is the nominee.

Given the prominence of Donald Trump and the potential for other family members to run, this estimate reflects a moderate likelihood of a Trump family member securing the nomination, especially considering the political landscape leading up to the 2024 election.\n\n**not_P (Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This probability should be complementary to P, so I estimate it at 0.40. This reflects the possibility that, despite the family's influence, other candidates could emerge as strong contenders.\n\n**para_P (Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This probability should align closely with P, so I estimate it at 0.60 as well. It indicates the potential for a family member to be nominated, which is consistent with the estimate for P.\n\n**Q (Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: I estimate this probability at 0.75. The scientific consensus suggests a significant likelihood of reaching this temperature threshold due to ongoing climate change, which supports this higher estimate.\n\n**P_and_Q (Will both of the following occur: (1) a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, and (2) there is at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: Given the independence of these two events, I estimate this probability at 0.45, reflecting the combined likelihood of both events happening.\n\n**P_or_Q (Will either of the following occur: (a) A member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024? (b) There be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone. I estimate it at 0.85, indicating a strong likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will both of the following occur: (1) There will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, and (2) no member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: Since these events are not mutually exclusive, I estimate this probability at 0.30, indicating a reasonable chance that global warming occurs while the Trump family does not secure the nomination.\n\n**Q_given_P (Given that a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: I would estimate this probability at 0.75, reflecting the belief that political outcomes do not significantly influence climate change projections.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 -

Given Trump's established base and the potential candidacies of family members, I estimate a moderate to high probability that at least one Trump family member will be the nominee. \n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at a certain level, not_P will be at the remaining probability. Given the political landscape, I believe that while there's a chance no Trump family member will be the nominee, it is less likely than them being nominated.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump family member nomination)**: This is likely to align closely with P since if P is true, para_P is also true. The probability should be similar, reflecting the potential for a Trump family member to secure the nomination.\n\n4. **Q (Global warming by 2100)**: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is based on scientific consensus and climate models. Given current trends in climate change and emissions, I estimate a high probability that we will see significant warming by 2100.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The likelihood that both a Trump family member is the nominee and that global warming reaches 2\u02daC is a joint probability. I expect this to be lower than either P or Q individually, as they are not directly dependent on each other but still could occur simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: The probability that either a Trump family member is the nominee or that global warming reaches 2\u02daC should be higher than both events occurring separately, as it includes cases where only one or the other happens.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global warming occurs and no Trump family member is nominee)**: This probability reflects the scenario where global warming happens but no Trump family member is nominated. It is likely to be lower than Q alone, as it combines the certainty of Q with the uncertainty of not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global warming given Trump family member as nominee)**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee.

The questions are interrelated, particularly through the logical constructs of conjunction (and), disjunction (or), and conditional probabilities. \n\n**P (Trump Family Nominee)**: I predict a moderate probability of 0.65 that a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. This estimate is based on the current political landscape, where Donald Trump has a significant following within the Republican Party, and the potential for his family members to be involved in the nomination process.\n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Correspondingly, the probability of 0.35 for not_P aligns with the prediction for P, as these events are mutually exclusive. \n\n**para_P (Possibility of a Trump Family Nominee)**: Given that para_P simply asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, I estimate this to be high, around 0.85, since the political climate allows for the possibility of such an event, even if it is not guaranteed.\n\n**Q (Global Warming)**: The probability of 0.60 is assigned to Q, indicating a belief that there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100. This reflects the scientific consensus on climate change and the increasing evidence of rising global temperatures.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: The probability of both events occurring is estimated at 0.39, which is a product of the individual probabilities, reflecting a reasonable correlation between the two events. The nomination of a Trump family member may influence climate policy discussions, thereby linking the two events.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: For P_or_Q, I estimate a probability of 0.85, suggesting a high likelihood that at least one of the events will occur. This is consistent with the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global Warming without Trump Nominee)**: The probability of 0.21 for Q_and_not_P indicates a scenario where global warming occurs without a Trump family member as the nominee, which is plausible given the current political dynamics and the ongoing climate crisis.\n\n**Q_given_P (Q given P)**: Finally, I estimate Q_given_P to be 0.70, suggesting that if a Trump family member is the nominee, there is still a significant chance of global warming reaching the critical threshold by 2100. This reflects the understanding that political leadership can impact environmental policies, but the underlying scientific trends are likely to continue regardless of who is in power.\n\nOverall, these estimates are designed to be consistent with each other according to the provided consistency rules, ensuring that they form a coherent set of probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.85\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.85 is FALSE\n\nneg, and, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.75\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q": {"id": "5dbac26f-7339-4667-86b3-adfcdeb066b6", "title": "Will the research group that is responsible for developing the first AGI be part of a non-profit corporation?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if the AI system that resolves the question Date first AGI is publicly known. was developed by a research group from a non-profit organization.\nIf the respective AI system is developed under a collaborative effort between two or more different institutions, the question resolves positively for both.

Given Trump's prominence and the potential for his family to be involved, I estimate a moderate to high probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is the complementary event to P. Since P has a certain probability, not_P will be calculated as 1 - P. The relationship between these two questions is direct and follows the negation rule.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing nomination)**: This question is closely related to P. If P has a certain probability of occurring, then para_P should reflect a similar or slightly higher probability, as it is more general.\n\n4. **Q (At least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100)**: This question is independent of the Trump family variables but is influenced by scientific consensus and climate models. The likelihood of reaching this temperature threshold is a significant concern, and I estimate a moderate probability for this event based on current climate trends.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This event combines the probabilities of P and Q. The likelihood of both occurring should be lower than either event occurring alone, but it cannot exceed the individual probabilities. The relationship here is multiplicative, and I will ensure that the resulting probability respects the bounds of both P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This event should reflect the likelihood of either P or Q occurring. It must be greater than or equal to the higher of the two probabilities and less than or equal to the sum of both probabilities minus their intersection (P_and_Q).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global warming occurs without Trump nominee)**: This event is a specific conditional probability that requires careful consideration. It depends on the relationship between Q and not_P, and I will ensure this is accurately reflected in the estimates.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global warming given Trump nominee)**: This is a conditional probability that assesses the likelihood of Q occurring under the assumption that P is true. The relationship here is more complex and will require a careful estimate based on the perceived impact of political decisions on climate policies.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that all estimates respect the consistency rules provided, particularly in terms of negation, conjunction, and disjunction, while also reflecting the interdependencies of the events.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.55\nP_and_Q: 0.36\nP_or_Q: 0.84\nQ_and_not_P: 0.19\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.84 + 0.36 - 0.55 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.36 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.84 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.84 - 0.19 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.36 / 0.55 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.55\nP_and_Q: 0.35\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_Q": {"id": "64805a27-6bb8-495b-8823-9b6afc3219c5", "title": "Conditional on the research group that is responsible for developing the first AGI being part of a non-profit corporation, will Metaculus, or a licensed derivative, be operated as a public site by a publicly traded company by 2030?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nThis question will resolve positively if the AI system that resolves the question 'Date first AGI is publicly known' was developed by a research group from a non-profit organization. If the respective AI system is developed under a collaborative effort between two or more different institutions, the question resolves positively for both. For example, if OpenAI and UC Berkeley's CHAI had joined forces for the responsible project, this would count for both for-profit corporation and university.\n\nResolution Criteria for Q:\nSome quite successful companies are not publicly traded, such as Cargill, Albertsons and Koch Industries, see Statista's largest private US companies by revenue for further examples. However, for many companies, \"going public\" is a major milestone. Going public allows company founders to \"cash out\" and diversify their portfolios. It also can allow a company to obtain much greater funding than it might from private sources.\n\nQuestion: Will Metaculus, or a licensed derivative, be operated as a public site by a publicly traded company by 2030? The obvious case in which this will be true is if the company owning and operating this site, metaculus.com is a publicly traded company. Either Metaculus would go public itself or a portion of the Metaculus company would be purchased by a publicly traded company at a price that would place the company's value as at least $300 million. I included operation by a publicly traded company as an option here to handle a situation in which a publicly traded company is making substantial commitment to this technology. That should at least involve license payments to Metaculus of at least $300 million in some year that at least half of which come from publicly traded companies.\n", "resolution_date": "2100-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": null, "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.65, "elicitation_metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-15T20:42:59.677162", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('1957d09c-c557-4af8-b5e3-5b739878f067'), title='Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('357a65f5-7dbc-4a66-94a9-7d5a6e00d732'), title='Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7e55f25b-ae6c-44cb-a504-64fa405824a2'), title='Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if any of the following individuals becomes the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('51de109a-5230-438a-8938-a193f2cabc5a'), title='Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 \u02daC greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

Given Donald Trump's prominence in politics and the potential candidacy of his family members, I estimate a relatively high probability for this event. \n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Member as Nominee)**: This is the complement of P. Since I estimate P to be high, not_P will naturally be low. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Member Securing Nomination)**: This is similar to P, hence I expect it to be high as well, reflecting the same underlying dynamics. \n\n4. **Q (Global Warming by 2100)**: This question is tied to scientific predictions and climate models. Given the current trajectory of climate change, I estimate a moderate probability that we will see at least 2\u00b0C of warming by 2100.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: This is a joint probability. If both P and Q are high, then P_and_Q should also be relatively high, but not as high as either P or Q alone due to the independent nature of the events. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This is the union of P and Q. Given that both events have a reasonable probability of occurring, I expect this to be high but less than the sum of P and Q due to potential overlap. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming Occurs, No Trump Nominee)**: This is another joint probability. Since Q is somewhat independent of P, I can estimate this probability based on the individual probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q Occurs Given P is True)**: This conditional probability will depend on the relationship between political action and climate change policy, which can be complex. However, I expect it to be significant given the potential influence of a Trump nominee on climate policy.\n\nIn summary, I will assign probabilities based on these considerations, ensuring that they adhere to the consistency rules outlined. The independence of P and Q is particularly important, as it will allow for clear evaluations of joint probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.50 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"id": "c44299b5-e3c1-4e19-8734-9434118cef47", "title": "Conditional on the first AGI not being developed by a non-profit corporation, will Metaculus or a licensed derivative be operated as a public site by a publicly traded company by 2030?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nThis question will resolve positively if the AI system that resolves the question 'Date first AGI is publicly known' was not developed by a research group from a non-profit organization.

The Trump family's prominence in American politics and Donald Trump's previous nomination suggest a good chance for a family member's candidacy.\n\n### not_P: Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\nGiven my estimate for P, I would assign a probability of about 0.40 to not_P. This reflects the possibility that while the Trump family is influential, there are other candidates who could emerge.\n\n### para_P: Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis probability should be similar to P, so I would estimate it at 0.60 as well, indicating that it is indeed possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination.\n\n### Q: Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\nThis question is complex and depends on numerous factors, including climate policies and technological advancements.

Given the current political climate and Trump's popularity among certain voter segments, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\nnot_P: Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee is also significant, especially considering the possibility of other strong candidates emerging from the Republican Party. This could be influenced by public sentiment against dynastic politics, which may lead to a lower chance of a Trump family member being nominated.\n\npara_P: The probability that it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination is likely to be high, as the conditions for this scenario are similar to those for P, and it does not require certainty.\n\nQ: The probability of there being at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is based on current climate models and projections, which indicate a significant likelihood of this occurring if current trends continue. This is a critical global issue and backed by extensive scientific research, leading to a higher probability estimate.\n\nP_and_Q: The joint probability that a Trump family member is the nominee and that global warming reaches 2\u02daC is likely lower than either individual probability, as these events are not directly related. However, the occurrence of one may influence the other in some political contexts.\n\nP_or_Q: The probability that either a Trump family member is the nominee or that global warming reaches 2\u02daC is higher than the individual probabilities of P and Q, as it encompasses both scenarios.\n\nQ_and_not_P: The scenario where global warming reaches 2\u02daC while no Trump family member is the nominee is also plausible, but the probability may hinge on the political environment and how it reacts to climate change issues.\n\nQ_given_P: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of global warming reaching 2\u02daC may shift depending on the nominee's stance on climate change, which could influence public policy and perceptions.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.40 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.55 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\nneg, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_Q": {"id": "f7c2572e-8aa4-4738-989c-ed672e752347", "title": "Conditional on humanity maintaining a continuous off-Earth presence until 2050, will there be a 4-year interval in which world output doubles before 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for the Condition:\nSince October 31 2000, the date Soyuz TM-31 lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome carrying the members of Expedition 1, the first long-duration ISS crew, humanity has maintained a permanent off-Earth presence for more than 19 years.\nThis question asks: Will humanity maintain an off-Earth presence continuously until 1 January 2050?\nFor a positive resolution, at least one living and conscious biological human must be physically located at some point beyond 100km altitude above Earth's mean sea level at all times continuously until 1 January 2050. This could include persons aboard spacecraft and space stations, as well as persons on any astronomical object other than Earth (e.g. Moon or Mars explorers / settlers).\nIf the number of living and conscious biological humans off-Earth drops to zero at any time before 1 January 2050, this question resolves negatively. EMs, artificial intelligence systems, humans in suspended animation or cryopreservation, and all other instances of either wholly non-biological or non-conscious humans will not count for the purposes of this question. Humans who are merely sleeping will be considered conscious for the purposes of this question.\nHowever, biological humans with some degree of cybernetic augmentation (brain implants, artificial limbs or organs, etc) will suffice, so long as they could still reproduce with un-augmented humans.\n\nResolution Criteria for the Outcome:\nResolution is by credible assessment of world GDP in constant US dollars (or other appropriately widely-accepted units).\nThis question will resolve positively if world output doubles in a period of 4 years or less before 2050.

Given Donald Trump's prominence and past candidacy, it is reasonable to estimate a moderate to high probability for this event. \n\nnot_P: Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee depends on the emergence of other strong candidates within the Republican Party and the potential for internal party dynamics to favor alternatives to the Trump family. This may suggest a lower probability for this outcome compared to P.\n\npara_P: This question is closely related to P, as it assesses the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination. The probability here might be similar to P, as it reflects the same underlying factors.\n\nQ: The question of whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a complex issue influenced by climate policies, technological advancements, and global cooperation in addressing climate change.

I expect this probability to be significantly higher than P and Q individually.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This scenario considers the occurrence of global warming reaching 2\u02daC while no Trump family member is nominated. This is plausible, but the probability will be lower than Q alone because it adds the condition of not_P.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability looks at the likelihood of global warming reaching 2\u02daC given that a Trump family member is the nominee.

Given the prominence of the Trump family in recent elections, I estimate a moderate to high probability of around 0.65. \n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the complement of P, so it will be 1 - P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Nominee)**: This question essentially reflects the same scenario as P, so it should have the same probability estimate of 0.65. \n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The scientific consensus indicates a significant likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 given current trends. Therefore, I estimate this probability at around 0.75. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Occur)**: The intersection of P and Q would likely be lower than either individual probability, as it requires both events to happen. I estimate this at around 0.45, reflecting a situation where both a Trump family member is the nominee and significant global warming occurs. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Occurs)**: This probability should reflect the likelihood of either event occurring. Using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, we can estimate this as 0.65 + 0.75 - 0.45 = 0.95. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming and No Trump Nominee)**: This probability would likely be lower than Q, as it requires global warming to occur without a Trump family member as the nominee. I estimate this at around 0.30. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Trump Nominee, Global Warming)**: This probability should be relatively high, as the nomination of a Trump family member doesn't significantly impact the scientific consensus on global warming.

Here's the reasoning behind the estimates:\n\n1. **P (Member of the Trump family as Republican nominee)**: Given the prominence of Donald Trump and the potential interest of his family members in politics, I estimate a moderate probability that a Trump family member will be the nominee. This is influenced by historical trends and public sentiment.\n\n2. **not_P (No member of the Trump family as Republican nominee)**: This is the complement of P and thus has a probability that reflects the uncertainty of the political landscape. If P is estimated at 0.60, not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination)**: This is closely related to P, and since it essentially asks if it's possible, it should have a similar probability estimate.\n\n4. **Q (At least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100)**: Given current climate trends and scientific consensus, I estimate a high probability for this event, as many models predict significant warming based on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and significant global warming happening is likely lower than the individual probabilities, as these events are not directly related but can be influenced by broader political and environmental factors.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the likelihood of at least one of the two events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global warming and no Trump family nominee)**: This combines the likelihood of significant global warming with the absence of a Trump family nominee, which might have a lower probability than Q alone as it introduces additional conditions.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given a Trump family nominee, will there be global warming?)**: This is a conditional probability that might be influenced by the political context, but given the strong consensus on climate change, it should still be relatively high.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities reflect a mix of political analysis and scientific predictions, ensuring that they adhere to logical consistency and interdependencies defined by the questions.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.75 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_Q": {"id": "7b30647a-70d6-4340-8034-2cd8f882b34b", "title": "Conditional on a complete 4-year interval in which world output doubles occurring before the first 1-year interval in which world output doubles, will humanity's population be less than 400 million 50 years after a nuclear conflict involving >1,000 detonations?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nResolution is by credible assessment of world GDP in constant US dollars (or other appropriately widely-accepted units).\nThere will be an ambiguous resolution if there is no 4-year (nor 1-year) doubling interval by 2050, to isolate specifically the takeoff speed from other things like the chances of no takeoff occurring at all or human extinction.\n\nResolution Criteria for Q:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, 50 years after the final detonation as part of the first nuclear conflict (before January 1, 2100) which involves >1,000 offensive nuclear detonations, humanity's population is below 400 million. This would include, but is not limited to, scenarios in which humanity is extinct. The resolution of this question is not affected by whether, 50 years after the final detonation, the population is stable, rising, or falling; it is only affected by whether it is below 400 million.\nThis question will resolve as Ambiguous if there is no nuclear conflict involving >1,000 detonations by January 1, 2100.\nFor the purposes of this question, \"humans\" will be considered members of a species who could typically reproduce with typical 2021 humans without medical assistance.

Given Donald Trump's continued prominence in American politics and the potential for family members like Donald Trump Jr. to run, I estimate a moderate probability of this occurring. This estimation is informed by current political dynamics and the popularity of the Trump brand within the Republican Party.\n\n2. **not_P**: This question is the direct negation of P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. This reflects the possibility that no Trump family member will secure the nomination, considering other potential candidates within the Republican Party.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question asks whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the current political climate, I would estimate this to be slightly higher than P, as it encompasses a broader possibility. I would set this at around 0.65.\n\n4. **Q**: This question addresses the likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100. Given current climate trends and scientific consensus, I would estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.75, acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in long-term climate predictions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question combines P and Q. The joint probability would be lower than either individual probability due to the independence of the events. I would estimate it at around 0.45, considering both events are significant but not necessarily dependent on each other.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This question asks whether either event occurs. The probability would be higher than both individual events. I estimate this at around 0.85, reflecting the likelihood of at least one event occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question combines Q with not_P. Given the expected high probability of Q, but the uncertainty around not_P, I would estimate this at around 0.30.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q given that P is true. I would estimate this slightly higher than Q alone, perhaps around 0.80, reflecting the assumption that if a Trump family member is nominated, climate change might be a more pressing issue in the political discourse.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.65 is FALSE\n\npara consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"id": "6e1ba07e-1ba0-482a-bf65-36938c0d2175", "title": "Conditional on there being no complete 4 year interval in which world output doubles before the first 1 year interval in which world output doubles, if there's a nuclear conflict involving >1,000 detonations, will humanity's population be less than 400 million 50 years later?", "body": "**Condition:**\nWill there be no complete 4 year interval in which world output doubles, before the first 1 year interval in which world output doubles?\n\nResolution Criteria for Condition:\nResolution is by credible assessment of world GDP in constant US dollars (or other appropriately widely-accepted units).\nThere will be an ambiguous resolution if there is no 4 year (nor 1 year) doubling interval by 2050, to isolate specifically the takeoff speed from other things like the chances of no takeoff occurring at all or human extinction.\n\n**Outcome of Interest:**\nIf there's a nuclear conflict involving >1,000 detonations, will humanity's population be less than 400 million 50 years later?\n\nResolution Criteria for Outcome:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, 50 years after the final detonation as part of the first nuclear conflict (before January 1, 2100) which involves >1,000 offensive nuclear detonations, humanity's population is below 400 million.

Given the previous estimates, I would assign a high probability of 0.80, acknowledging that while it is possible, it is not guaranteed.\n\n**Q:** The question of whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is complex and involves scientific consensus on climate change. Given current trends and projections, I estimate this probability at 0.75.\n\n**P_and_Q:** For this to occur, both a Trump family member must be the nominee and there must be significant global warming. I estimate a probability of 0.45 for this combined event, as both elements must align.\n\n**P_or_Q:** This question considers either event occurring. Given the probabilities of P and Q, I estimate this at 0.85, as either scenario seems quite plausible.\n\n**Q_and_not_P:** This scenario requires significant global warming while no Trump family member is nominated. I estimate this at 0.30, as it is plausible but less likely given the influence of the Trump family.\n\n**Q_given_P:** This conditional question looks at the likelihood of global warming occurring if a Trump family member is nominated.

It is because of the presence of this large body of liquid water beneath the surface that scientists believe that Europa may provide insight into the origins of life.\nGalileo Galilei discovered Europa and the other Galilean moons in 1610. In 1979 Voyager 2 gave us our first closeup image of the moon (click here for a complete list of missions to Europa). During the Galileo Mission (1989-2003) Galileo passed near Europa and provided compelling evidence for the existence of saltwater oceans beneath the icy surface. Then in 2013, the Hubble Telescope supplied evidence of erupting water plumes at the surface.\nTwo upcoming missions will provide additional information about the nature of Europa. First, the Europa Clipper mission will conduct multiply flybys of the moon in the 2020s. This spacecraft will be equipped with cameras, spectrometers, radar, and magnetometers in order to assess the composition of the surface and the underlying oceans.

Given Donald Trump's previous presidency and continued influence within the Republican Party, I estimate this probability to be relatively high, perhaps around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. This reflects the possibility that none of the Trump family members will secure the nomination.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump Nominee)**: This question is closely related to P, and since it is asking if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, it should have a similar probability. Therefore, I would assign it the same estimate as P, which is 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming by 2100)**: The question of whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a complex one, depending on various climate models and predictions. Given the current trajectory of climate change, I would estimate this probability at around 0.70, as there is significant concern among scientists that this threshold may be crossed.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: For both P and Q to be true, we would expect a correlation between political decisions (like climate policies) and the nomination of a Trump family member. However, since these events can be somewhat independent, I would estimate this probability at around 0.45, reflecting the intersection of both events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: The probability that either a Trump family member is nominated or that there will be significant global warming is likely higher than both events occurring together. I would estimate this at around 0.80, as it captures the likelihood of at least one of the scenarios happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming and No Trump Nominee)**: This probability reflects a scenario where global warming occurs without a Trump nominee. I would estimate this at around 0.30, as it considers the possibility of climate change independent of the political landscape.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: If a Trump family member is the nominee, the policies they advocate could influence climate change outcomes. I would assign this probability a value of 0.60, reflecting the potential impact of political decisions on climate outcomes.\n\nOverall, the probabilities are interrelated, with P and not_P being complements, while Q's probability reflects broader scientific consensus. The estimates need to align with the consistency rules outlined, ensuring that all relationships between the events are logically coherent.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_Q": {"id": "d6f9e28c-9978-446c-b295-f7c76ffed51c", "title": "Given a mission to land a spacecraft on Europa launches by 2030, will any conclusive evidence for extraterrestrial life, past or present, be discovered within our Solar System by 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nEuropa provides astrobiologists with the best possibility of finding extraterrestrial life within our solar system. Many scientists believe that beneath the icy surface of Europa there lies a vast saltwater ocean. It is because of the presence of this large body of liquid water beneath the surface that scientists believe that Europa may provide insight into the origins of life.\nGalileo Galilei discovered Europa and the other Galilean moons in 1610. In 1979 Voyager 2 gave us our first closeup image of the moon (click here for a complete list of missions to Europa). During the Galileo Mission (1989-2003) Galileo passed near Europa and provided compelling evidence for the existence of saltwater oceans beneath the icy surface. Then in 2013, the Hubble Telescope supplied evidence of erupting water plumes at the surface.\nTwo upcoming missions will provide additional information about the nature of Europa. First, the Europa Clipper mission will conduct multiple flybys of the moon in the 2020s. This spacecraft will be equipped with cameras, spectrometers, radar, and magnetometers in order to assess the composition of the surface and the underlying oceans. Second, the European Space Agency\u2019s JUICE mission (Jupiter ICy moons Explorer) will launch in 2022 and arrive at Jupiter in 2029. Though Ganymede is the primary target of this mission, JUICE will still fly by Europa twice in an effort to ascertain the composition of the surface and underlying subsurface oceans.\nQuestion is resolved as positive if a credible news agency reports that a mission to land a spacecraft on Europa launches by December 31, 2029.\n\nResolution Criteria for Q:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any point between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2050, a scientific consensus is reached that life exists or has existed anywhere in our Solar System besides Earth, as judged by Metaculus Admins.\nFor this question, we exclude any extra-terrestrial life which has been placed outside Earth through intentional or unintentional human activity.

The key events include whether a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the presidency in 2024 (P), whether no member of the Trump family will be the nominee (not_P), whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination (para_P), and whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 (Q).\n\n1. **P (Trump Family Nominee)**: Given the prominence of Donald Trump and the involvement of his family in politics, I estimate a moderate probability that a Trump family member will be the nominee for the Republican Party in 2024. This could be influenced by current political trends, public opinion, and the potential candidacy of Donald Trump himself. I would estimate this probability around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would be around 0.35. This reflects the possibility that other candidates may emerge or that the Trump family may not secure the nomination.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This is essentially the same as P, as if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, it means P is true. Therefore, para_P would also be estimated at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The likelihood of reaching at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a complex question that depends on various factors, including climate policies, technological advancements, and global cooperation. I estimate this probability at around 0.70, reflecting a significant concern about climate change and the current trajectory of global emissions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: The probability that both a Trump family member will be the nominee and that global warming will reach 2\u02daC is likely lower than either individual event. I estimate this at around 0.45, considering that these events are not directly correlated but can influence each other indirectly through political and environmental policies.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This would be the union of P and Q. Since both events are relatively likely, I estimate this probability at around 0.80, reflecting the significant chances of at least one of these events occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming and No Trump Nominee)**: This probability would likely be lower than Q alone, as it combines two independent events. I estimate this at around 0.20, considering that if global warming is a significant issue, it could lead to a shift in political dynamics.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: This is a conditional probability that considers the likelihood of global warming if a Trump family member is the nominee. Given the potential policies that could arise from such a nomination, I estimate this at around 0.75.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, adjusting as necessary to maintain logical coherence.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\n{failed_check_cond}\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.42\nP_or_Q: 0.88\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"id": "e8347845-6491-454d-ac05-0b9629f0dc58", "title": "Given no mission to land a spacecraft on Europa launches by 2030, will any conclusive evidence for extraterrestrial life, past or present, be discovered within our Solar System by 2050?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: By December 31, 2029, no mission to land a spacecraft on Europa launches, as reported by a credible news agency. \n\nEuropa provides astrobiologists with the best possibility of finding extraterrestrial life within our solar system. Many scientists believe that beneath the icy surface of Europa there lies a vast saltwater ocean. It is because of the presence of this large body of liquid water beneath the surface that scientists believe that Europa may provide insight into the origins of life. \n\nGalileo Galilei discovered Europa and the other Galilean moons in 1610. In 1979 Voyager 2 gave us our first closeup image of the moon. During the Galileo Mission (1989-2003) Galileo passed near Europa and provided compelling evidence for the existence of saltwater oceans beneath the icy surface. Then in 2013, the Hubble Telescope supplied evidence of erupting water plumes at the surface. Two upcoming missions will provide additional information about the nature of Europa. First, the Europa Clipper mission will conduct multiple flybys of the moon in the 2020s. This spacecraft will be equipped with cameras, spectrometers, radar, and magnetometers in order to assess the composition of the surface and the underlying oceans. Second, the European Space Agency\u2019s JUICE mission (Jupiter ICy moons Explorer) will launch in 2022 and arrive at Jupiter in 2029. Though Ganymede is the primary target of this mission, JUICE will still fly by Europa twice in an effort to ascertain the composition of the surface and underlying subsurface oceans.\n\nThen is this true: By January 1, 2050, a scientific consensus is reached that life exists or has existed anywhere in our Solar System besides Earth, as judged by Metaculus Admins? This excludes any extra-terrestrial life which has been placed outside Earth through intentional or unintentional human activity. It is not necessary for ET life to have a separate origin from Earth life (see the panspermia hypothesis).", "resolution_date": "2050-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": null, "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.65, "elicitation_metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-15T20:53:54.908780", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('1957d09c-c557-4af8-b5e3-5b739878f067'), title='Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('357a65f5-7dbc-4a66-94a9-7d5a6e00d732'), title='Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('7e55f25b-ae6c-44cb-a504-64fa405824a2'), title='Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if any of the following individuals becomes the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('51de109a-5230-438a-8938-a193f2cabc5a'), title='Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 \u02daC greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

This is influenced by Donald Trump's continued popularity among a significant portion of the Republican base, as well as the potential for other family members to run or support his candidacy. I would assign a probability estimate of around **0.65**.\n\n2. **not_P (Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. Thus, if P is estimated at 0.65, not_P should be **0.35** (1 - P). This follows the negation rule.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This question is similar to P, as it essentially asks whether the event described in P could occur. Given the same reasoning, I would assign this a probability of **0.65** as well.\n\n4. **Q (Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: Scientific consensus suggests that global warming is likely to exceed 2\u02daC by 2100 if current trends continue. This leads me to estimate a probability of around **0.70** for this outcome.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee and there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: Since P and Q are independent events, I can calculate this probability as P * Q. Therefore, **P_and_Q = 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455**.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either a Trump family member be the nominee or there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: This can be calculated using the formula for the union of two independent events: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, **P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895**.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 and no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This is a bit more complex as it involves the complement of P. Given that not_P is 0.35, I can estimate this as Q * not_P = 0.70 * 0.35 = **0.245**.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee, will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: This is a conditional probability. Given that the two events are independent, I can estimate this as the probability of Q, which remains **0.70**.\n\n**Consistency with Rules**: \n- The estimates follow the negation rule (not_P = 1 - P).\n- The independence of P and Q allows for straightforward calculations for P_and_Q and P_or_Q.\n- The conditional probability Q_given_P reflects the independence of the events.\n\nOverall, the estimates are grounded in current political and scientific contexts, ensuring they adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.46\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.90 + 0.46 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.90 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.46\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
