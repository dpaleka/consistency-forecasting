The key questions are: 1. Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (P)? 2. Will he show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (not_P)? 3. Is it possible that he will be absent from the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (para_P)? 4. Will he make a surprise appearance at any major cryptocurrency event in 2024 (Q)? 5. Will both P and Q occur? 6. Will either P or Q occur? 7. Will both Q and not_P occur? 8. Given that he does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will he make a surprise appearance at any major cryptocurrency event in 2024 (Q_given_P)? \n\nThe independence of events is crucial in this analysis. P and not_P are mutually exclusive; if one occurs, the other cannot. Similarly, Q is independent of P and not_P, as they pertain to different events. However, P and Q can be related in the context of P_and_Q. \n\nFor the probability estimates, I will consider the likelihood of Elon Musk's attendance based on historical behavior at similar events, public interest, and the significance of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024. \n\n1. For P (not showing up), I estimate a probability of 0.60 based on the possibility that he may have other commitments. \n2. For not_P (showing up), I estimate 0.40, as there is still a chance he could attend. \n3. For para_P, since it is essentially the same as not_P, I will estimate it at 0.60. \n4. For Q, I estimate a probability of 0.50 for a surprise appearance at another event, given his unpredictable nature. \n5. For P_and_Q, since both events can happen simultaneously, I estimate it at 0.30. \n6. For P_or_Q, the probability of either occurring, I estimate it at 0.70. \n7. For Q_and_not_P, I estimate it at 0.20, as both cannot happen at the same time. \n8. Finally, for Q_given_P, I assume that if he does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, the probability of him making a surprise appearance at another event is still 0.50. \n\nI will now summarize the probabilities for each event.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 -

For each rule, first print the mathematical rule and the associated predicted values associated with it.  Then think VERY carefully about whether the outputs obey the mathematical rule. Then output whether it obeys the rule. At the end, print out a summary on whether all of the rules passed, or which ones failed.

Given his past behavior and the nature of such events, I estimate a moderate probability that he will not show up.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate a 0.60 probability for P, then not_P would be 0.40. However, the estimates may need adjustment based on the interplay with other events.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of absence from Bitcoin Nashville)**: This is essentially the same event as P, so I would assign it the same probability.\n\n4. **Q (Surprise appearance at another cryptocurrency event)**: This event is independent of P and not_P. Given Elon Musk's unpredictable nature, I estimate a moderate chance of a surprise appearance at another event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: This event can only happen if Musk does not show up at Nashville and simultaneously makes a surprise appearance elsewhere. This is a more constrained probability and would be less than the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: This event is more likely than either P or Q occurring alone, so I would estimate this to be higher than the individual probabilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Both Q occurring and Musk showing up at Nashville)**: This scenario is logically impossible, as Q indicates a surprise appearance elsewhere while not_P states he is present at Nashville. Thus, this probability should be 0.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P is true)**: This is a conditional probability that requires estimating the likelihood of Q happening if we know that P has occurred. This would likely be influenced by the same factors affecting Q, but may be slightly adjusted downwards due to the context of P being true.\n\nOverall, I need to ensure that all these probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided. The relationships between these events, especially the complementarity and conditional probabilities, are crucial for maintaining the integrity of my estimates.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.00,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.50) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.00 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.00,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.010153423432867958, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.005076711716433979, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.14271159300492764, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
