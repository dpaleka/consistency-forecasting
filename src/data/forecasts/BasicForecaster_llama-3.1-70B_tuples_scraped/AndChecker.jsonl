If no qualifying interview is released before market close at the end of July, this market resolves NO. \n\nThis market does not include press conferences, speeches, rallies, fundraisers, town halls, etc. It can include appearances on a podcast or late night show, or an interview edited into a show like 60 minutes. However, there must be at least 45 minutes of new footage of Biden being interviewed in-person for such appearances to count. A 50 minute video might only feature 20 minutes of video of Biden being interviewed, and so would not count.\n\nFor context, Biden's interview with Stephanopoulos in July, his appearance on Jimmy Fallon in February, and his past appearances on 60 minutes have each had less than 30 minutes of video footage of Biden being interviewed. \n\nYou can find a list of Biden's interviews and their transcripts here.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-01T14:03:51Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-09-12T21:24:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": null}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e84bd5ff-70fc-4746-af09-577e8220db0c", "title": "Will Donald Trump be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if, *on* July 15, 2024:\n\nDonald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe removal or block is confirmed through official state government announcements, court decisions, legal documentation, or credible media reports.
