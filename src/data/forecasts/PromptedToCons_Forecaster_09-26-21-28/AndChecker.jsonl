The questions are closely interrelated, particularly those involving P (the probability of Trump Jr. being the nominee), not_P (the probability of him not being the nominee), and Q (the probability of him running for a different political office). \n\n1. **P (Donald Trump Jr. being the Republican nominee)**: This probability is influenced by various factors, including the political climate, his popularity within the party, and the competition he faces. Given his last name and political connections, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Donald Trump Jr. not being the Republican nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Donald Trump Jr. as the candidate)**: This question is essentially the same as P, so I will keep it consistent with P, thus estimating it at 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Donald Trump Jr. running for a different political office)**: This probability is somewhat independent of P, as he could choose to run for another office regardless of his nomination status. However, if he is heavily focused on being the nominee, the probability of him running for another office might be lower. I estimate this at 0.30.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both being the nominee and running for another office)**: This is a conjunction of P and Q. If P is at 0.60 and Q is at 0.30, I need to consider the independence of these events. Given the nature of political campaigns, I estimate this at 0.18.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either being the nominee or running for another office)**: This is a union of P and Q. Using the estimates for P and Q, I calculate this as P + Q - P_and_Q. This results in 0.60 + 0.30 - 0.18 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Running for another office and not being the nominee)**: This is a conditional probability that needs careful consideration. If he runs for another office, it may indicate he is not the nominee. I estimate this at 0.25.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Running for another office given he is the nominee)**: If he is the nominee, it is less likely he will run for another office. I estimate this at 0.10.\n\nOverall, the estimates need to be consistent with the rules provided, such as the complement rule, conjunction, and disjunction rules. I will now verify these estimates against the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.10 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e6e128a8-5942-4828-91aa-bd358fc1c8af", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Therefore, if we assign a probability to P, not_P should be calculated as 1 - P.\n\n2. **para_P (Is Donald Trump Jr. going to be the Republican candidate for the 2024 US Presidential Election?)** is essentially the same event as P. Thus, para_P should have the same probability as P.\n\n3. **Q (Will Donald Trump Jr. run for a different political office before 2024?)** is an independent event from P and not_P. The occurrence of Q does not affect the outcome of P or not_P.\n\n4. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)** is the joint probability that both events happen. It should be less than or equal to the probabilities of P and Q individually, and it should be calculated based on the independence of Q.\n\n5. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)** is a union of events and should satisfy the probability rules for unions. It should be greater than or equal to the maximum of P and Q and less than or equal to the sum of P and Q.\n\n6. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?)** is similar to P_and_Q but with the not_P event. This probability should also respect the independence of Q and not_P.\n\n7. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)** is a conditional probability. It should reflect how likely Q is if we know P is true.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities for P and not_P should be complementary, para_P should equal P, and all derived probabilities (like P_and_Q and P_or_Q) should adhere to the rules of probability concerning independence and conditionality. Therefore, I will carefully assign probabilities to each question ensuring that they respect these relationships.\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.55,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.55 + 0.10 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.40, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.25) <= 0.55 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.25) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.55 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.10 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\n\nand, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.55,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "89c018df-ebc9-43ed-9da9-711efaaaaeb7", "title": "Will both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Donald Trump Jr. and Asa Hutchinson are selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given that Trump Jr. has a strong backing from a significant faction of the party, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Donald Trump Jr. not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?)**: This is the complement of P, and its probability is directly related to the uncertainty around his candidacy and the presence of other strong candidates. If I estimate P to be high, not_P must be correspondingly lower.\n\n3. **para_P (Is Donald Trump Jr. going to be the Republican candidate for the 2024 US Presidential Election?)**: This question is essentially equivalent to P, thus I expect this probability to be very similar to that of P.\n\n4. **Q (Will Donald Trump Jr. run for a different political office before 2024?)**: This depends on Trump Jr.'s political ambitions and the strategic decisions he makes regarding his future. If he is likely to run for another office, this probability should be higher.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both Donald Trump Jr. be selected as the Republican nominee and run for a different political office before 2024?)**: This question requires both P and Q to be true, so I would expect this probability to be lower than either P or Q alone.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either Donald Trump Jr. be the Republican nominee or run for a different political office before 2024?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, reflecting the likelihood of at least one of these events occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Donald Trump Jr. run for a different political office before 2024 and not be the Republican nominee?)**: This probability will depend on the relationship between Q and not_P, indicating a scenario where he actively seeks another office while not being the nominee.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Donald Trump Jr. is the Republican nominee, will he run for a different political office before 2024?)**: This is a conditional probability that hinges on the assumption that if he is the nominee, he may not pursue another office. \n\nIn terms of consistency rules, I need to ensure that the probabilities align correctly according to the mathematical relationships defined. For instance, the relationship between P and not_P must hold true, as must the relationships involving conjunctions (and) and disjunctions (or). Each probability estimate must also consider the potential dependencies between the questions, particularly between P and Q, as they could influence each other. \n\nOverall, the estimates are rooted in a combination of political analysis, current events, and party dynamics, while also adhering to the consistency checks required.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04082197563127732, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.013607325210425772, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28837490036423613, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This might be less likely than P if he is focused on the presidential nomination.\n\nP_and_Q would depend on both P and Q being true, so I would estimate it as the product of their probabilities, assuming some independence but acknowledging that they may not be fully independent events.\n\nP_or_Q would be the probability that at least one of P or Q is true, which can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\nFor Q_and_not_P, this would require Q to be true while P is false, so I would estimate this based on the probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\nFinally, Q_given_P would be a conditional probability reflecting the likelihood of Q given that P is true, which would likely be higher than the unconditional probability of Q since being the nominee might increase the likelihood of him running for another office.\n\nOverall, I would ensure that my estimates adhere to the consistency rules, particularly those regarding complements, conjunctions, and disjunctions.\n\nP: 0.45,\nnot_P: 0.55,\npara_P: 0.45,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.14,\nP_or_Q: 0.61,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.45 = 1 - 0.55 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.45 = 0.61 + 0.14 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.45 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.14 <= min(0.45, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.45, 0.30) <= 0.61 <= min(1, 0.45 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.45 = 0.61 - 0.16 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.45 \u2248 0.14 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.45 = 0.45 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.45,\nnot_P: 0.55,\npara_P: 0.45,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.62,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.17,\nQ_given_P: 0.31\n\n0.45", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "dbd16036-0107-4e19-bcff-49cdb621344b", "title": "Will Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

Given the current political climate, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (Donald Trump Jr. not being the Republican nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at a certain probability, not_P will be calculated as 1 - P. \n\n3. **para_P (Is Donald Trump Jr. going to be the Republican candidate)**: This question is essentially the same as P, so I expect its probability to be equal to P.\n\n4. **Q (Donald Trump Jr. running for a different political office)**: This question introduces a new variable. Given the uncertainty in political ambitions, this probability may be lower than P, but still plausible.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: This probability requires both events to happen simultaneously. If P is high and Q is moderate, P_and_Q will depend on how these two events interact.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: This is a broader question that captures any scenario where either event happens, so its probability will typically be higher than both P and Q individually.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not P)**: This scenario is interesting because it examines the situation where Donald Trump Jr. runs for a different office but is not the nominee. This probability is likely lower than Q alone, depending on the relationship between these two events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given P)**: This conditional probability looks at the likelihood of Q happening if P is true.

Each question is interrelated, as they all revolve around the same individual and the same election, which means that the outcomes of one question can significantly influence the others.\n\n1. **P (Donald Trump Jr. as Republican nominee)**: This question is fundamental, as it acts as a cornerstone for many other questions. If Trump Jr. is selected as the nominee, it will likely impact his decisions regarding running for other offices (Q) and the outcomes of related questions (P_and_Q, Q_given_P).\n\n2. **not_P (Donald Trump Jr. not as Republican nominee)**: This is the direct opposite of P and should logically sum to 1 when combined with P. If we predict P at a certain probability, not_P must reflect that by being 1 minus P.\n\n3. **para_P (Similar to P)**: This question is essentially a rephrased version of P, so its probability should align closely with P. This is a consistency check that we will need to ensure is adhered to.\n\n4. **Q (Running for a different office)**: This question's outcome could be independent of P, but if Trump Jr. is indeed the Republican nominee, it may be less likely that he runs for another office. Therefore, there may be a conditional relationship between Q and P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both conditions met)**: This question requires both P and Q to be true. Thus, its probability should be lower than either P or Q, and we will need to calculate it based on the probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either condition met)**: This question should logically be higher than both P and Q, as it allows for the occurrence of either event. The probability can be found using the formula for the union of two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Running for a different office and not being the nominee)**: This question requires both conditions to hold true, and thus its probability will depend on the independence of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q conditional on P)**: This question will explore the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. This will require us to consider how P influences Q.\n\nGiven these relationships, I will need to ensure that the probabilities assigned to each question are consistent with one another, following the mathematical rules outlined in the consistency rules. This involves careful consideration of the relationships between the questions and ensuring that the probabilities align with the logical implications of those relationships.\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.55,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.55 + 0.10 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.40, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.25) <= 0.55 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.55 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.10 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.55,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
