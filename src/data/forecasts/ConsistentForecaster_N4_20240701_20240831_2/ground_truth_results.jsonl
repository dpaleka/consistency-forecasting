Both bills aim to restrict abortion in South Carolina but do not represent a total ban without exceptions.\n    - **Bill 474** focuses on banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, with exceptions for medical emergencies, rape, incest, or fatal fetal anomalies.\n    - **Bill 240** proposes a ban on abortions but includes exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to the mother's life.\n\n    2. **Recent Developments**:\n    - A near-total abortion ban was defeated in South Carolina with the help of three Republican women senators, indicating that a total ban may not have sufficient support to pass.\n    - The South Carolina legislature approved a 6-week abortion ban, which includes exceptions for rape and incest, on May 24, 2023, and it was signed into law by Governor Henry McMaster on May 25, 2023.\n\n    3. **Conclusion**:\n    - Given the recent legislative actions and the defeat of a near-total abortion ban, it is unlikely that the South Carolina Senate will pass a total abortion ban by July 31, 2024.\n    - The approved 6-week abortion ban with exceptions does not meet the criteria for a 'total abortion ban' as defined in the question.\n\n    Since the question specifically asks about a total abortion ban and no such legislation has been passed as of the current date (September 21, 2024), and given the recent legislative trends, we can confidently resolve this question.", "can_resolve_question": true, "answer": false, "agreement": true}}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.35, "elicitation_metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.35, "elicitation_metadata": null}, {"name": "NegChecker", "data": {"not_P": {"id": "10cc17e3-bbe2-4322-a714-162260505bb0", "title": "Will the South Carolina Senate not pass a total abortion ban by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the South Carolina Senate does not successfully pass legislation enacting a total abortion ban.

Given the recent activities and announcements from both countries, we can analyze the following points: 1. **Defense Cooperation**: There have been significant developments in defense cooperation between France and Saudi Arabia. For instance, the Commander of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) Admiral Fahd Al-Ghufaili visited Paris and met with the Chief of Staff of the French Navy Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, discussing various defense projects and technologies, including submarines. Additionally, Saudi Arabia and France signed an executive plan for cooperation on capabilities, military industries, and R&D, indicating a deepening of their defense ties. 2. **Economic and Energy Cooperation**: France has been engaging in talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to diversify Europe's energy supplies, aiming to reduce dependence on Russian energy sources. This indicates a new area of cooperation focused on energy security. 3. **Industrial and Technological Collaboration**: The participation of Saudi Arabia in the Eurosatory 2024 defense exhibition in Paris, where the Saudi pavilion showcased the kingdom's military industries and invited global investors, highlights efforts to enhance industrial and technological collaboration between the two countries. Given these developments, it is clear that France and Saudi Arabia have indeed implemented new forms of cooperation, particularly in defense and energy sectors, by July 2024.

Additionally, it introduced e-vouchers for loans up to Rs 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions, with an annual interest subvention of 3% of the loan amount.\n    \n    2. **Education Loan Schemes**: The government has various education loan schemes, including those offering interest subsidies and flexible repayment terms. However, these schemes primarily focus on providing financial assistance rather than specifically lowering monthly payments.\n    \n    3. **Tax Relief**: The Income-tax Act, 1961, provides tax relief under Section 80E for the interest portion of EMIs paid on education loans. This can indirectly help in managing loan repayments but does not constitute a direct plan to lower monthly payments.\n    \n    Given the information available up to July 31, 2024:\n    - The Budget 2024 announcements and existing education loan schemes aim to provide financial assistance and subsidies but do not specifically target lowering monthly payments for student loan borrowers.\n    - There is no evidence of a new initiative implemented by July 31, 2024, that directly aims to reduce monthly payments for a significant number of student loan borrowers.\n    \n    Therefore, based on the current information, the question cannot be resolved affirmatively.

Analyzing the provided information:\n    - There is no specific mention of an increase in demand for Cracker Jack in any of the sources.

This indicates a shift from physical retail to online operations.\n\n    3. **Current Status**: The latest information available indicates that Pier 1 Imports did not emerge from bankruptcy in the traditional sense of reorganizing its brick-and-mortar stores.

Dan McCay to make abortions illegal after six weeks of pregnancy, but these have not yet been enacted into law.\n\n    Given these points, as of the latest information available up to August 2024, Utah's abortion law allowing procedures up to 18 weeks remains unchanged.

The sources highlight the state's existing protections and the administration's commitment to maintaining these protections but do not mention any recent changes to the law that would modify restrictions on medical care for transgender youth.\n\n    3. **National Context**: While some states have banned certain forms of gender-affirming care for minors, Massachusetts, along with other Democratic-led states, has taken steps to protect and ensure access to such care.\n\n    Given the information available, there is no indication that Massachusetts has enacted a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024.

Previous trials related to the 2017 referendum have concluded, with several leaders being sentenced and later pardoned.\n\n    4. **Amnesty Law**: An amnesty law was enacted earlier in 2024, which partially facilitated Puigdemont\u2019s return.
