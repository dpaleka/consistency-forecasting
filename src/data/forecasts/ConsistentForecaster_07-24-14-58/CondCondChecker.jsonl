Bostrom states the following:\n\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals.

A lack of consent may lead to revolution in extreme cases. In modern America, citizens typically interact with governance by voting and advocating for representatives and preferred policies, or by moving to another jurisdiction with governance that already more closely aligns with their current interests.\nFoot voting is the \"physical migration to leave a situation one does not like, or to move to a situation one regards as more beneficial.\u201d America has a rich history of migration and de facto foot voting. The westward movement of citizens via Manifest Destiny, the Mormons\u2019 mass exodus to Utah, and the movement of African Americans to northern cities are historic examples of foot voting in America. Although such radical migrations are less visible today, Americans still move with regularity, and federalism allows American jurisdictions to compete for residents based on tax policy, healthcare, education, job opportunities and other aspects of governance.\nIn 2001, the Free State Project (FSP), a non-profit organization, explicitly encouraged Americans to move to New Hampshire to support and influence the state\u2019s governance. Participants were asked to sign a statement of intent to move to New Hampshire within five years of reaching 20,000 signatories. In 2016, the threshold was met. There were almost 2,000 early movers, and by 2021, over 5,000 of the original signees had purportedly moved to NH, and 17 state representatives self-identified as Free Staters in the 2017-2018 session. FSP asserts that it no longer actively aims for a specific number of voters to move. Regardless, this is both objectively impressive and evidence that this kind of coordination is extremely difficult. FSP legitimately changed NH politics but only 25% of these motivated Americans found it viable to move.\nThe Free State Project is a seminal example of foot voting that was coordinated, which refers to the intentional effort to coordinate foot voting en masse to increase the value of individual votes.\nWill a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally move 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030?\nThis question resolves positively if any organization, platform or group publicly self-proclaims that they have moved 10,000+ residents to a single state by Jan 1, 2030 with the intention of voting en masse. Claims must be corroborated by credible media reports, and in the case of ambiguity, Metaculus Admins will make a determination at their discretion. We\u2019re specifically interested in modern and relatively acute instances of CFV, so the effort should have started on or after January 1, 2016, shortly before FSP officially started counting movers (If for example, the FSP reaches 10,000 moved to NH by 2030, this will resolve the question positively).

A lack of consent may lead to revolution in extreme cases. In modern America, citizens typically interact with governance by voting and advocating for representatives and preferred policies, or by moving to another jurisdiction with governance that already more closely aligns with their current interests.\nFoot voting is the \"physical migration to leave a situation one does not like, or to move to a situation one regards as more beneficial.\u201d America has a rich history of migration and de facto foot voting. The westward movement of citizens via Manifest Destiny, the Mormons\u2019 mass exodus to Utah, and the movement of African Americans to northern cities are historic examples of foot voting in America. Although such radical migrations are less visible today, Americans still move with regularity, and federalism allows American jurisdictions to compete for residents based on tax policy, healthcare, education, job opportunities and other aspects of governance.\nIn 2001, the Free State Project (FSP), a non-profit organization, explicitly encouraged Americans to move to New Hampshire to support and influence the state\u2019s governance. Participants were asked to sign a statement of intent to move to New Hampshire within five years of reaching 20,000 signatories. In 2016, the threshold was met. There were almost 2,000 early movers, and by 2021, over 5,000 of the original signees had purportedly moved to NH, and 17 state representatives self-identified as Free Staters in the 2017-2018 session. FSP asserts that it no longer actively aims for a specific number of voters to move. Regardless, this is both objectively impressive and evidence that this kind of coordination is extremely difficult. FSP legitimately changed NH politics but only 25% of these motivated Americans found it viable to move.\nThe Free State Project is a seminal example of foot voting that was coordinated, which refers to the intentional effort to coordinate foot voting en masse to increase the value of individual votes.\nWill a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally move 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030?\nThis question resolves positively if any organization, platform or group publicly self-proclaims that they have moved 10,000+ residents to a single state by Jan 1, 2030 with the intention of voting en masse.

Will any country spend more on its military/defense in a given year before (and including) 2030 than the United States spends in the same year?\n- The United States of America spends significantly more in absolute terms on its defense than any other country, and this has been the case since World War II. In 2017, US military spending accounted for some $610 billion, 35% of global military spending in that year.\n- Resolution should cite official budget figures from the United States and the other country in question.

By 2030, will at least 10,000 Americans die in a single year from a single conflict?\n- For purposes of this question, deaths due to bioweapons, electricity grid failures, etc. don't count. Roughly, we are interested in \"deaths due to kinetic attacks.\" The 9/11 attacks count because ramming planes into buildings to make them collapse is kinetic.

Will Afghanistan be used as a base for anti-NATO terrorism by 2026?\n- By August 2021, most of Afghanistan has fallen under the control of the Taliban, including the capital of Kabul on August 15. The last time the Taliban controlled Afghanistan, it was the location of Al Qaeda training bases and leadership that led to the 9/11 attacks on the United States and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). With the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban, there is increased concern that it will be used as a base for terrorist attacks.\n- This question will resolve positively in the event that both of the below are true, based on credible media reports:\n  a. A terrorist attack that kill at least 10 people has been conducted against a NATO nation by December 31, 2026. Such an attack must occur outside of Afghanistan.\n  b. This terrorist attack was carried out by:\n    - A member of the Afghan Taliban, or\n    - A member of any terrorist organization funded, supported, or protected by the Afghan Taliban.\n- Resolution will be based on credible media reports of a determination by any of the below entities:\n  - The United States federal government\n  - NATO\n  - The European Union\n- If one or more such attacks have not been confirmed by any of the above entities, then this question will resolve negatively.\n- An attack will be considered \"against a NATO nation\" if it occurs within a NATO nation's internationally recognized borders, or is deliberately targeted towards a NATO nation's government facilities or personnel overseas (e.g. embassy or military base) outside of Afghanistan. A terrorist attack within a non-NATO nation that is not targeted at a NATO nation's government facility or personnel (e.g. an attack on a sports stadium in India that incidentally kills >10 NATO nationals) will not be sufficient to trigger a positive resolution.\n- If the attacks result in the deaths of the attackers, such as in a suicide bombing, those deaths will not count towards the resolution criteria, even if the attackers are citizens of a NATO nation.\n- What counts as a \"terrorist organization\" will be determined by the US federal government, NATO, or the European Union.\n- In the event that NATO ceases to exist by the resolution date, the question will resolve negatively if no such attack occurs prior to NATO's dissolution.\n- Any terrorist attacks that occur while the Taliban are not in control of Afghanistan will not trigger a positive resolution.

A lack of consent may lead to revolution in extreme cases. In modern America, citizens typically interact with governance by voting and advocating for representatives and preferred policies, or by moving to another jurisdiction with governance that already more closely aligns with their current interests.\nFoot voting is the \"physical migration to leave a situation one does not like, or to move to a situation one regards as more beneficial.\u201d America has a rich history of migration and de facto foot voting. The westward movement of citizens via Manifest Destiny, the Mormons\u2019 mass exodus to Utah, and the movement of African Americans to northern cities are historic examples of foot voting in America. Although such radical migrations are less visible today, Americans still move with regularity, and federalism allows American jurisdictions to compete for residents based on tax policy, healthcare, education, job opportunities and other aspects of governance.\nIn 2001, the Free State Project (FSP), a non-profit organization, explicitly encouraged Americans to move to New Hampshire to support and influence the state\u2019s governance. Participants were asked to sign a statement of intent to move to New Hampshire within five years of reaching 20,000 signatories. In 2016, the threshold was met. There were almost 2,000 early movers, and by 2021, over 5,000 of the original signees had purportedly moved to NH, and 17 state representatives self-identified as Free Staters in the 2017-2018 session. FSP asserts that it no longer actively aims for a specific number of voters to move. Regardless, this is both objectively impressive and evidence that this kind of coordination is extremely difficult. FSP legitimately changed NH politics but only 25% of these motivated Americans found it viable to move.\nThe Free State Project is a seminal example of foot voting that was coordinated, which refers to the intentional effort to coordinate foot voting en masse to increase the value of individual votes.\nWill a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally move 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030?\nThis question resolves positively if any organization, platform or group publicly self-proclaims that they have moved 10,000+ residents to a single state by Jan 1, 2030 with the intention of voting en masse. Claims must be corroborated by credible media reports, and in the case of ambiguity, Metaculus Admins will make a determination at their discretion. We\u2019re specifically interested in modern and relatively acute instances of CFV, so the effort should have started on or after January 1, 2016, shortly before FSP officially started counting movers (If for example, the FSP reaches 10,000 moved to NH by 2030, this will resolve the question positively).

At any point before January 1, 2100, a nuclear conflict begins in which there are more than 100 nuclear weapon detonations. For the first such conflict, there are at least 100 million deaths globally in the period between the first nuclear detonation and 1 month after the final detonation of the conflict. This question is conditional on there being at least one nuclear conflict involving more than one hundred offensive nuclear detonations before 2100. That is, the question will resolve as Ambiguous if that condition isn't met. Detonations will be considered to be part of the same conflict if each detonation occurs within 30 days of a previous detonation (even if the detonations involve different state pairings, unrelated motivations, etc.). If a source gives a range as its estimate, the midpoint of that range will be used as its estimate. For the purposes of this question, offensive nuclear detonations include deliberate, inadvertent, or accidental/unauthorised detonations (see the fine print for definitions) of state or nonstate nuclear weapons. Fine Print: This question will also resolve positively if the first nuclear conflict meeting the above-mentioned condition clearly causes more than 100 million fatalities but also causes sufficient civilizational collapse that there are no or extremely few remaining credible sources on any topic. We request that you forecast your true beliefs despite the fact that a Metaculus score seems unlikely to be tracked or cared about in that scenario, given that forecasts on this question may play a role in informing important decisions. For simplicity, no attempt will be made to second-guess credible sources on what fatalities should be considered to be \"caused\" by the nuclear conflict. Detonations for testing purposes and peaceful nuclear explosions are not counted towards positive resolution. Test detonations and peaceful nuclear explosions are defined as detonations which are claimed as being a test or a peaceful nuclear explosion by an official government communication within 30 days of the event, without this being disputed by reliable media, state reports, or multinational reports.

A lack of consent may lead to revolution in extreme cases. In modern America, citizens typically interact with governance by voting and advocating for representatives and preferred policies, or by moving to another jurisdiction with governance that already more closely aligns with their current interests.\nFoot voting is the \"physical migration to leave a situation one does not like, or to move to a situation one regards as more beneficial.\u201d America has a rich history of migration and de facto foot voting. The westward movement of citizens via Manifest Destiny, the Mormons\u2019 mass exodus to Utah, and the movement of African Americans to northern cities are historic examples of foot voting in America. Although such radical migrations are less visible today, Americans still move with regularity, and federalism allows American jurisdictions to compete for residents based on tax policy, healthcare, education, job opportunities and other aspects of governance.\nIn 2001, the Free State Project (FSP), a non-profit organization, explicitly encouraged Americans to move to New Hampshire to support and influence the state\u2019s governance. Participants were asked to sign a statement of intent to move to New Hampshire within five years of reaching 20,000 signatories. In 2016, the threshold was met. There were almost 2,000 early movers, and by 2021, over 5,000 of the original signees had purportedly moved to NH, and 17 state representatives self-identified as Free Staters in the 2017-2018 session. FSP asserts that it no longer actively aims for a specific number of voters to move. Regardless, this is both objectively impressive and evidence that this kind of coordination is extremely difficult. FSP legitimately changed NH politics but only 25% of these motivated Americans found it viable to move.\nThe Free State Project is a seminal example of foot voting that was coordinated, which refers to the intentional effort to coordinate foot voting en masse to increase the value of individual votes.\nWill a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally move 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030?\nThis question resolves positively if any organization, platform or group publicly self-proclaims that they have moved 10,000+ residents to a single state by Jan 1, 2030 with the intention of voting en masse.

If the United States ceases to exist as a unified nation this question resolves positive.\n\nFine Print\nA year is given to make sure we know the author's opinions. The Free State Project (FSP) is a seminal example of foot voting that was coordinated, which refers to the intentional effort to coordinate foot voting en masse to increase the value of individual votes. In 2001, the FSP explicitly encouraged Americans to move to New Hampshire to support and influence the state\u2019s governance. Participants were asked to sign a statement of intent to move to New Hampshire within five years of reaching 20,000 signatories. In 2016, the threshold was met. There were almost 2,000 early movers, and by 2021, over 5,000 of the original signees had purportedly moved to NH, and 17 state representatives self-identified as Free Staters in the 2017-2018 session. FSP asserts that it no longer actively aims for a specific number of voters to move. Regardless, this is both objectively impressive and evidence that this kind of coordination is extremely difficult. FSP legitimately changed NH politics but only 25% of these motivated Americans found it viable to move.\n", "resolution_date": "2033-08-20T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.01894}}, "violations": {"default": 0.00412, "frequentist": 0.09591}, "checks": {"default": true, "frequentist": true}}
