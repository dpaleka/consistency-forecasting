If Biden announces that he will not accept the Democratic nomination, it would likely create a significant shift in the dynamics of the election. Harris, as the current Vice President and a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, would likely become a more viable candidate. Nate Silver's model, which takes into account various factors such as polling data, fundraising, and other metrics, would likely adjust Harris's odds of winning accordingly. However, the key factor to consider is the specific condition that Biden's announcement must be 'definitive, unambiguous, and made publicly by Biden or his campaign, leaving no possibility of him accepting the nomination for the 2024 election.' This suggests that the announcement would need to be a clear and irreversible decision, rather than a mere speculation or a conditional statement. Given this context, it's likely that Nate Silver's model would increase Harris's odds of winning, but the extent of the increase would depend on various factors, including the timing and tone of Biden's announcement, as well as the reaction of other candidates and the broader political landscape. However, without more information on Nate Silver's model and its specific parameters, it's difficult to make a precise prediction.

For (a), it's difficult to predict with certainty whether Joe Biden will announce his decision before July 15, 2024. However, given that the question is asking about a specific event that has not yet occurred, we can consider the historical context and Biden's previous statements. Biden has been hinting at running for re-election, but he has not made a definitive statement about his intentions. Without access to real-time information or insider knowledge, it's challenging to assign a high probability to this event occurring. However, it's also unlikely that Biden would make a public announcement without a strong reason, so we can't rule it out entirely. For (b), we need to consider Nate Silver's model and its predictions for Kamala Harris's Electoral College probability. While Nate Silver's model is widely respected, it's essential to remember that it's a probabilistic model, and its predictions can change based on new data and information.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that any person who has engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States or has given aid or comfort to the enemies of the United States shall not hold any office under the United States. This provision has been interpreted by some to potentially apply to individuals who have incited or participated in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, which Donald Trump is alleged to have done. Given this context, there are several reasons why Trump might be removed or blocked from the ballot: 1. Legal challenges: Multiple lawsuits have been filed against Trump under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, alleging that his actions on January 6, 2021, constituted insurrection or rebellion. Some of these lawsuits have already led to court decisions that have removed or blocked Trump from the ballot in certain states. 2. State-level actions: Some states, such as New Mexico, have taken steps to remove Trump from their primary election ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Other states may follow suit. 3. Public opinion and pressure: There is significant public pressure and opposition to Trump's candidacy, which could lead to further legal challenges and state-level actions against him. However, there are also reasons why Trump might not be removed or blocked from the ballot: 1. Legal defenses: Trump's lawyers may argue that he did not engage in insurrection or rebellion, or that his actions on January 6, 2021, were not sufficient to disqualify him under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. 2. Appeals and reversals: Even if Trump is removed or blocked from the ballot in some states, he may appeal the decisions or seek reversals through the courts. 3. Lack of uniformity: The application of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is not uniform across states, and some states may not take action against Trump. Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as of July 15, 2024, is around 60%.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding public office. If Trump is removed or blocked from the primary ballot under this section, it suggests that he has been deemed to have engaged in such behavior by the relevant authorities. This would likely have significant repercussions for his nomination chances, as it would indicate that a substantial portion of the Republican Party establishment views him as unfit for office.\n\nHowever, it's also worth considering the dynamics of the Republican Party and the potential for Trump to still secure the nomination through other means. The Republican National Convention is a delegate-driven process, and Trump has a strong base of support among many Republican voters. Even if he is removed from the primary ballot in some states, he may still be able to accumulate enough delegates to secure the nomination.\n\nAdditionally, the resolution of this question is based on the decision made by the delegates of the Republican National Convention, regardless of the eventual outcome of the 2024 US election.

Condition 1: Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024. To evaluate this, we need to consider the legal and political context surrounding Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Section 3 disqualifies individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The likelihood of Trump being removed or blocked under this section is uncertain, as it would require a determination by state election officials or courts that he has engaged in insurrection or rebellion. While there have been efforts to invoke Section 3 against Trump, it's unclear whether any state will successfully remove him from the ballot. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring as around 0.2 (20%), as it would require a significant legal and political shift. Condition 2: Donald Trump being selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This is a more straightforward scenario, as Trump has a history of winning Republican primaries and has expressed interest in running in 2024. However, the Republican National Convention could potentially choose another candidate, especially if Trump faces significant opposition or if his popularity within the party wanes. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring as around 0.7 (70%), as Trump has a strong connection with the Republican base and has a history of success in the party's primaries. Now, to estimate the probability that both conditions occur, we need to consider the intersection of these probabilities. Since the two conditions are not mutually exclusive (e.g., Trump could be removed from the ballot but still be nominated by the convention), we need to calculate the joint probability. However, given the relatively low probability of Condition 1, the most likely outcome is that Condition 2 will occur without Condition 1. Therefore, I'd estimate the probability of both conditions occurring as around 0.14 (14%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.006213593318924571, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0020711977729748567, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.12031612481285556, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historically, the US Olympic team has been one of the top-performing teams in terms of total medals, with a strong presence in both the Gold and Silver medal categories. However, there have been instances where other teams have surpassed the US in terms of total medals, especially when the Olympics are held in regions with a strong athletic presence. Given the conditions specified in the question, we can break down the probability into two parts: 1. The US winning more Gold than Silver medals: This is a relatively common occurrence for the US Olympic team, given their strong performance in track and field events, swimming, and gymnastics, among others. However, there is always a possibility that other teams might have a strong showing in these events, potentially disrupting the US's Gold-to-Silver ratio. 2. The US topping the Olympic Medal Table: This requires the US to not only win more Gold than Silver medals but also accumulate more total medals than any other team. Given the strong competition from teams like China, Great Britain, and Russia, this is a more challenging condition to meet. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of the US winning more Gold than Silver medals to be around 70-80%. However, the probability of the US topping the Olympic Medal Table is lower, given the strong competition from other teams, and I would estimate it to be around 40-50%.

Firstly, the Olympics are a global event that attract a large number of countries, providing opportunities for many nations to win their first-ever Olympic medals. However, the overall number of countries winning their first medal for the first time is relatively low compared to the total number of countries participating. Historical data from previous Olympics suggests that around 20-30 countries typically win their first Olympic medal every four years. This is a rough estimate, but it gives us a baseline to work with. We can assume that around 25 countries might win their first medal, on average. However, the actual number of countries winning their first medal can vary significantly from this average, depending on various factors such as the strength of participating teams, the quality of athletes, and the specific sports included in the Olympics. To estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their first medal, we should consider the distribution of possible outcomes. A conservative approach would be to assume that the number of countries winning their first medal follows a Poisson distribution, which is often used to model the number of rare events. Using this distribution, we can estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their first medal. Using the historical average of 25 countries winning their first medal, we can calculate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their first medal.

First, the number of countries that win their first Olympic medals has been steadily increasing over the years. At the 2016 Olympics in Rio, 19 countries won their first medal. At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, that number increased to 33. This upward trend can be attributed to several factors, including increased global participation in the Olympics, growth in international sporting events and competitions, and more accurate tracking of results from National Olympic Committees (NOCs). Moreover, we can expect an increase in the number of gold medal winners from countries that didn't win gold previously in the Olympics. Additionally, the Paris 2024 Olympics are introducing some special events and new competitions such as surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing, as well as breaking. However, these sports and others have been growing rapidly on the international level in previous years, leading to larger pools of eligible countries who could potentially earn a gold medal. Based on past trends and factors like globalization and increased NOC attention, it seems probable to expect a similar number to the 33 from 2020 to also rise in 2024; however, without historical basis for a gold, its harder to assert if another 5 would get this feat.

Condition (b) involves Joe Biden making a public announcement that he will not seek or accept the Democratic nomination for President before July 15th, 2024.

Considering these conditions, I believe the probability of both (a) and (b) occurring is relatively low, but not impossible. Biden's decision to drop out or not accept the nomination would likely be a closely guarded secret until he announces it publicly. Even if a group of 5 Dem House Members or Senators were to pressure him to drop out, it's unclear whether they would succeed in convincing him, given his commitment to the party and his own ambition. Furthermore, Biden's camp might try to keep him in the running for strategic reasons, even if a group of his colleagues pressures him to drop out. However, condition (b) seems more predictable, as it directly depends on Biden's public declaration.

Firstly, let's look at Ireland's chances. Historically, Ireland has been a consistent performer in the Eurovision contest, with several wins and top-10 finishes. In recent years, they have continued to produce high-quality entries, which has helped them maintain a strong presence in the competition. Given their past success and the quality of their recent entries, it's reasonable to assume that Ireland has a good chance of qualifying for the Grand Final. Next, let's consider Luxembourg's chances. Luxembourg has not had the same level of success as Ireland in the Eurovision contest, but they have still managed to qualify for the Grand Final in some years. In recent years, they have not been as competitive, but they have still produced some decent entries. While it's difficult to predict their chances, it's possible that they could surprise us and qualify for the Grand Final. However, the key to answering this question is to consider the likelihood of both countries qualifying. Since the question requires both countries to qualify, we need to think about the probability of both events occurring. This is where the concept of independence comes in. If Ireland and Luxembourg's qualification are independent events, then we can multiply their individual probabilities to get the probability of both events occurring. Assuming Ireland has a 70% chance of qualifying (based on their historical performance and recent entries), and Luxembourg has a 30% chance of qualifying (based on their recent performance and lack of consistency), we can multiply these probabilities to get the probability of both countries qualifying."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.004921098301185839, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0016403661003952796, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.10871420664383429, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, let's consider the probability of Vivek Ramaswamy being the Republican nominee. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of the Republican National Convention, we can look at the current polling and delegate count. As of my knowledge cutoff, Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new entrant in the race and has not gained significant traction.

Additionally, the delegate count is heavily skewed towards the top candidates, with Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, and Ron DeSantis leading the pack.

To answer this, we need to consider the political landscape of Ohio's 6th district and the factors that might influence the outcome of the special election. Ohio's 6th district is currently represented by Bill Johnson, a Republican. However, the question of whether the Republicans will retain the district in 2024 is uncertain. The district has a slight Republican lean, but it has also been known to be competitive in recent elections. If Joe Biden were to announce that he will not accept the Democratic nomination, it could potentially have several effects on the political landscape.

On the other hand, it could also lead to a split in the Democratic Party, potentially benefiting the Republicans. However, without more information about the specific circumstances of the special election and the candidates involved, it is difficult to make a definitive prediction about the outcome.

For (a), it is generally assumed that Joe Biden, being the incumbent President of the United States, intends to run for re-election. However, he is not yet officially confirmed for the Democratic nomination. We have to consider the following points: Biden hasn't explicitly announced his presidential campaign plans. Considering the U.S. tradition, an incumbent president seeks re-election, and a presidential announcement doesn't come out of blue. In the context provided, an announcement of NOT seeking another term before a specified deadline (July 15, 2024) might seem possible, but Joe Biden not seeking another presidential term has not been proven.

Firstly, let's consider the likelihood of Biden dropping out before July 20, 2024. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at the historical context and Biden's current situation. Biden has been the Democratic nominee since 2020 and has shown no signs of dropping out. He has a strong support base and has been actively campaigning. While there is always a possibility of unexpected events or health issues, the likelihood of him dropping out before July 20, 2024, seems low. Next, we consider the likelihood of Will Hurd being the Republican nominee. Will Hurd is a former US Representative from Texas and has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2024 Republican nomination. However, the Republican nomination process is highly competitive, and several other strong candidates are also vying for the nomination.

First, let's consider the condition that Biden remains President through the end of July 2024. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at the historical precedent and current trends. Joe Biden is a seasoned politician with a significant amount of experience, and he has not shown any signs of resigning or being unable to complete his term. In the United States, presidential transitions are typically smooth, and it's rare for a president to leave office early. Given this context, I would estimate that the probability of Biden remaining as President through the end of July 2024 is around 0.95 (95%). Next, let's consider the condition that Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding public office. In the case of Donald Trump, this has been a topic of discussion, particularly regarding his involvement in the January 6th, 2021, Capitol insurrection. While there have been calls for his disqualification, it's uncertain whether a state or federal court would ultimately rule in favor of his disqualification. However, given the ongoing investigations and lawsuits related to Trump's actions, I would estimate the probability of Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, as around 0.40 (40%). Since both conditions must be met for the question to resolve as 'Yes,' we need to consider the joint probability of both events occurring. Assuming independence between the two events, we can multiply the probabilities together. Therefore, the probability that both conditions will be met is approximately 0.95 * 0.40 = 0.38."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.05728351817371902, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.01909450605790634, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.35131992925994693, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The EU's announcement of tariffs on Chinese EVs is a significant economic event that could have far-reaching implications for the global automotive industry. However, its direct impact on the US political landscape, particularly on the Democratic Party, is less clear. 2. The pressure on Biden to drop out of the 2024 re-election campaign is more likely to come from within the party, driven by factors such as internal party politics, personal relationships, and policy disagreements rather than external economic events like the EU's tariff announcement. 3. While the EU's tariff announcement might create a sense of economic uncertainty and potentially harm the US economy, it is unlikely to be a decisive factor in convincing at least 5 Democratic House Members or Senators to collectively pressure Biden to drop out. 4. The Democratic Party is known for its internal cohesion and loyalty to its leaders, particularly the incumbent President.

Firstly, regarding the EU announcing new tariffs: the European Union has imposed several rounds of tariffs on Chinese goods in recent years, primarily due to trade tensions related to the EU's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Chinese government's subsidies to state-owned enterprises. However, the EU has also shown a willingness to engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve trade disputes. There have been no credible reports of the EU planning to impose new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024. Therefore, I consider this condition to be relatively unlikely. Secondly, regarding the Democratic Party members pressuring Biden: the US presidential election is a highly polarized event, and it's difficult to predict the actions of individual politicians. However, it's worth noting that there have been some reports of Democratic Party members expressing concerns about Biden's candidacy, particularly in light of his age and declining popularity. Nevertheless, these reports are anecdotal and do not necessarily indicate a coordinated effort from at least 5 named Democratic Party members. Given the ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding this condition, I consider it to be relatively unlikely as well. However, the two conditions are not entirely independent of each other. The EU's decision to impose new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles could potentially be influenced by the US-China trade relationship, which might in turn affect the US presidential election.

Firstly, let's consider the likelihood of Joe Biden announcing that he will not seek re-election. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, there have been rumors and speculation about Biden's potential decision not to run for re-election. However, as of my knowledge cutoff, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that he has made a definitive decision.

Secondly, let's consider the likelihood of a member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024.

Additionally, there are other potential candidates within the Trump family who could potentially run, such as Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Tiffany Trump, Melania Trump, or Barron Trump.

As of my knowledge cutoff, the 2024 presidential election is still over a year away, and the polling landscape is subject to change due to various factors such as campaign events, debates, and external events. However, I can analyze the historical data from past elections and current trends to make an educated estimate.

Additionally, there is no clear indication that Harris would be designated as President or Acting President in the near future. Therefore, I assign a low probability to this condition being met. The second condition is that one of the specified Trump family members is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. While it is possible that one of the Trump family members could be the Republican nominee, it is not a certainty. The Republican primary is a competitive process, and many other candidates may also be vying for the nomination. However, given the current political climate and the popularity of the Trump name within the Republican party, I assign a moderate probability to this condition being met.

Since there is an underlying implication that President can somehow remain in office beyond end date of term under other powers, and with possibility he may still give assignments through Acting capacity; hence without a clear information saying vice president is President, even though the language about resolutions says that would lead the market to end (to yes) based merely the formal designation language being said to be main cause it is unlikely 99%."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "3232b4f3-23c7-4c11-bfce-29e7660ccc79", "title": "Conditional on Kamala Harris becoming President or Acting President by July 26, 2024, will Biden remain President through end of July 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Vice President Kamala Harris is formally designated as President or Acting President of the United States at any point before July 26, 2024, 11:59 PM ET.

Event (a) seems unlikely at the moment. While Kamala Harris may take on an acting or temporary presidential role, being formally designated as President or Acting President involves a specific process that may not occur before July 26. Event (b) is more complex. Assuming that Kamala Harris becomes Acting President for a brief period under the 25th amendment does not change the resolution. However, the critical question is whether Joe Biden can remain US President through the end of July 2024 without any changes to his presidency. There's no publicly available information or credible sources suggesting he intends to resign or that any circumstances are likely to result in him ceasing to be President before the specified date. Therefore, his continued presidency appears to be a near certainty. Since these two events are conditionally related (Harris becoming Acting President could only happen under specific circumstances in which Biden remains President, but both conditions need to be independently evaluated), a more careful consideration of probabilities is warranted. Considering Biden's continuation as President (event b) appears virtually certain given the current lack of public information about impending changes, while event (a) seems more complex and currently uncertain. Taking these points into consideration, the conditional probability that the question resolves to YES hinges on event (a), which involves the likelihood of Kamala Harris being formally designated as President or Acting President. The specific timeframe and criteria for such designation are difficult to estimate probabilistically given the information. However, since both scenarios are mutually exclusive, conditional on both happening (specifically that Harris is acting president) and considering we are calculating the likelihood both events occurring together (Joe Biden's continued presidency making Harris Acting President under these conditions feasible), it leads to evaluating the specific odds of Kamala Harris formally being designated President or Acting President by July 26, given Joe Biden would have had to be serving as President to facilitate the scenario that makes event a feasible in the context provided. Therefore, I find it improbable for the required conditions for event a (Kamala Harris's formal designation as President or Acting President) to happen before the specified date based on our current information about the specifics of her and Joe Biden's status before July 26. It is probable, given his continued role, but with the specified constraints of official designation within the time limit, making it challenging for event (a) to occur without specific events. Given this detailed analysis and the independence of these conditions, with event (a) as the limiting condition, it's a scenario that I consider highly uncertain and challenging to achieve in the time frame provided and under the conditions stated in the prompt.

First, let's consider Sha'Carri Richardson's chances of winning a gold medal. She is a talented sprinter, but the competition in the women's 100m and 4x100m relay events will be fierce. Assuming she performs at her best, I estimate her chances of winning a gold medal in the 100m event to be around 5-10%. For the 4x100m relay, her chances of winning a gold medal would depend on the strength of the US relay team and the performance of the other teams, but let's assume her chances are around 10-20%. Therefore, the overall probability of her winning a gold medal in either event is around 5-20%. Next, let's consider France's chances of placing in the top 5 in the medal table. France has a strong athletic program and has consistently performed well in the Olympics in recent years. However, the competition will be intense, and they will need to perform well across multiple events to achieve a top 5 finish. Assuming they have a decent performance, I estimate their chances of placing in the top 5 to be around 20-30%. Now, we need to consider the probability of both events occurring together. Since the two events are not mutually exclusive, we need to multiply the individual probabilities. However, we need to consider the possibility that Sha'Carri Richardson could win a gold medal in the 100m event, but France might not place in the top 5. Or vice versa. To account for this, we can use the concept of conditional probability. Assuming the individual probabilities are independent, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the individual probabilities. However, since the events are not independent (the performance of France in the medal table could be influenced by Sha'Carri Richardson's performance in the 100m event), we need to adjust the probability accordingly. Let's assume the conditional probability of France placing in the top 5 given that Sha'Carri Richardson wins a gold medal is around 50-60%. This is because France's performance in the medal table will be influenced by their overall performance across multiple events, not just Sha'Carri Richardson's performance.

While it's possible that he could drop out due to unforeseen circumstances, the probability of this occurring before July 20 is low.

In reality, the occurrence of condition (a) might affect the likelihood of condition (b).

The probability of Ireland qualifying can be estimated by looking at their past performance in the competition. Ireland has a relatively strong history in Eurovision, with several top-10 finishes in recent years. However, the competition is highly unpredictable, and many factors can influence a country's chances of qualifying. Assuming that Ireland's past performance is a good indicator of their future chances, I would estimate their probability of qualifying as around 0.6 (60%). Cyprus, on the other hand, has had a more mixed record in Eurovision. While they have had some notable successes, they have also had some disappointing finishes. Based on their past performance, I would estimate their probability of qualifying as around 0.4 (40%). To estimate the probability that both countries will qualify, I need to consider the probability of both events occurring independently. Assuming that the qualification of one country does not affect the other, I can multiply the probabilities of each country qualifying to get the probability of both countries qualifying. This gives me a probability of 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 (24%). However, this calculation assumes that the qualification of one country does not affect the other, which may not be the case. For example, if Ireland qualifies, it may increase the chances of Cyprus qualifying, and vice versa. To account for this, I need to consider the correlation between the two events.

The current state of the 2024 presidential election: As of my knowledge cutoff, the 2024 US Presidential Election is still more than a year away, and the Republican primary field is expected to be crowded and competitive.

Trump's lead could be due to various factors, including his name recognition, popularity, and campaign momentum, but it may not necessarily translate to a clear path to the nomination. 3. The Republican National Convention: The convention is where the delegates ultimately select the nominee, and it's possible that the delegates may choose a different candidate even if Trump is leading in the polls. However, Trump's influence and support among Republican voters and delegates could make it challenging for another candidate to gain traction. 4.

Condition (a) implies a relatively narrow lead in the polls, which can fluctuate due to many factors, including campaign changes, voter sentiment, and other external events. Based on historical polling data, we can expect some fluctuation in the lead up to the election, and it's possible that the lead could be within this narrow range on July 15, 2024. However, predicting precise poll numbers this far in advance is challenging, as there are many variables influencing the outcome. Condition (b) is more unpredictable, as it depends on various factors, including political alliances, candidate performances, and delegate decisions at the Republican National Convention. Historical patterns and current trends indicate that it's difficult to forecast the outcome of primaries and nominations with high confidence. Considering these factors, we can estimate the combined probability of both conditions by looking at the individual components: For condition (a), the probability is roughly 20-30%, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding polling numbers and the relative stability of the lead needed to satisfy the condition. We're assuming a flat prior over the range. For condition (b), the probability is also quite low, around 10-20%, based on the unpredictability of delegate decisions and the performance of candidates in the selection process. Combining these estimates, we get an overall probability of around 2-6% (i.e., 20% x 10%). However, this is very rough and should be adjusted considering the specific context, like how these events depend on each other.

Firstly, the Republican primary is inherently uncertain, with multiple potential candidates vying for the nomination. While Ted Cruz is a plausible candidate, the outcome of the Republican primary is influenced by factors such as campaign strategies, fundraising, and voter support. Therefore, I assess the probability of Ted Cruz being the Republican nominee at 0.2. This reflects the uncertainty of the primary process and the likelihood of other candidates posing strong challenges to Cruz's nomination. Secondly, Joe Biden's decision not to seek re-election or accept the Democratic nomination in 2024 is highly uncertain. Biden has previously stated his intention to seek re-election, but has also hinted at the possibility of not running. In the absence of a clear, definitive statement from Biden or his campaign, it's challenging to estimate the likelihood of condition b resolving as Yes.

Typically, they have significant resources, a strong campaign infrastructure, and a loyal base of supporters, which makes it difficult for them to abandon their bid for re-election. Secondly, Biden's age is a concern, and some analysts have questioned his ability to withstand the physical and mental demands of another presidential campaign. However, his campaign has been robust in addressing these concerns, and he has shown no signs of slowing down. Thirdly, the Democratic primary is likely to be competitive, but Biden's position in the party is still strong, and he has a significant lead in the polls. This makes it less likely that he will drop out due to a lack of support from the party or the voters. Lastly, the market's resolution date is July 20, which is relatively close to the 2024 presidential election. If Biden drops out before this date, it would likely be due to some significant event or development that would make it difficult for him to continue his campaign.

Firstly, let's consider Biden's decision to drop out. Biden has not publicly announced any plans to drop out of the presidential race, and his campaign has been actively campaigning and fundraising. However, it's also worth noting that Biden is 80 years old, and there have been concerns about his age and health. While these concerns might affect his campaign, they don't necessarily mean he'll drop out. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20, 2024, as relatively low, around 0.2. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding public office. Trump's role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has been widely reported and documented. However, the process of removing or blocking Trump from the ballot would require a significant effort from state election officials, courts, or other authorities. While it's possible that some states might attempt to remove or block Trump, the likelihood of this happening in enough states to meet the condition is relatively low. I would estimate the probability of this occurring as around 0.3. Since these two conditions are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to estimate the probability of both occurring.

Assuming a random selection process for illustrative purposes, we can estimate the probability of a country qualifying for the Grand Final. In a typical Eurovision semi-final, around 10 countries qualify for the Grand Final out of 18-20 participating countries. This implies a probability of approximately 0.5 to 0.55 (10/18 to 10/20) for a country to qualify. However, this is a rough estimate and actual probabilities may vary. Given that both Georgia and Estonia need to qualify, we need to consider the probability of both events occurring. Assuming independence between the two events, we can multiply the individual probabilities. However, without more information, it's difficult to assign a specific probability to each country qualifying. Considering the information provided and typical Eurovision selection processes, I will assign a moderate probability to both countries qualifying."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08593907360584256, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, if Joe Biden announces that he will not accept the Democratic nomination, it will be a significant event with major implications for the 2024 US presidential election. This event, in itself, is unlikely to have a direct impact on the situation in Ukraine. However, considering the announcement date of July 15, 2024, there are approximately 48 days remaining before the potential Russian control is assessed. The question resolution hinges on whether Russia gains control over Chasiv Yar in this time frame. Chasiv Yar is a small city in eastern Ukraine, which has been involved in the ongoing conflict. Russia has made significant advances in the region, and the ISW map, which serves as the basis for the question's resolution, likely reflects the evolving situation on the ground. Given the dynamics of the conflict and Russia's push for territorial control, there is a reasonable possibility that Russia may solidify its control over Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024, even considering the announcement about Joe Biden.

For part (a), Joe Biden's decision to run or not run for re-election as President of the United States is a complex issue with many factors at play, including his personal and public statements, the party's nomination process, and various external factors such as public opinion and potential challengers. While it is impossible to predict with certainty whether Biden will run or not run, I will consider his statements and actions up to now. As of the resolution date, Biden has publicly stated his intention to seek re-election, and it is likely that he will continue to do so. However, there is also a possibility that he might change his mind or decide not to run, but this is still speculative. Given the uncertainty, I will assign a probability to part (a) occurring. For part (b), the question is focused on the control of the location Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, which is a specific geographical area in Ukraine. The resolution of this part is heavily dependent on the military situation in the region and the assessment of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map on the given date.

Assuming that the outcomes of the two parts are independent (i.e., knowing whether Biden will run or not does not affect the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine), the combined probability can be calculated as follows: Probability of part (a) occurring: 30% (I am using a conservative estimate based on Biden's past statements and the complexity of his decision-making process) Probability of part (b) occurring: 40% (I am using a neutral estimate based on my understanding of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the unpredictability of the military situation) Combined probability of both parts occurring: 30% x 40% = 12%.

Firstly, there is no direct causal link between Inflection's report and OpenAI's availability of ChatGPT in the EU. Inflection's report is related to their own AI model's safety, while OpenAI's ChatGPT is a separate product. However, we can consider the broader context and potential implications of Inflection's report. If Inflection publishes a report indicating that their AI model has been successfully red-teamed by an external party, it could potentially set a precedent or raise awareness about the importance of external safety testing for AI models. This might lead to increased scrutiny or regulatory pressure on companies like OpenAI to ensure the safety and security of their own models. On the other hand, the report could also be seen as a positive development, demonstrating that external safety testing is a valuable and effective way to improve AI model safety. This might lead to increased confidence in the safety of AI models and potentially accelerate their deployment in the EU. Given these considerations, it's difficult to establish a clear causal link between Inflection's report and OpenAI's availability of ChatGPT in the EU. However, if we assume that the report has a positive impact on the regulatory environment or public perception of AI model safety, it's possible that this could lead to increased availability of ChatGPT in the EU. However, this is still a speculative scenario, and there is no concrete evidence to suggest that Inflection's report would directly influence OpenAI's availability of ChatGPT in the EU. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of OpenAI's ChatGPT being generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024, given that Inflection publishes a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, to be around 0.6."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "142a893b-4fa0-43d1-9228-becebda5eb85", "title": "Will both of the following occur by June 30, 2024: (a) Inflection publishes a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety, and (b) OpenAI's ChatGPT is generally available in the European Union?", "body": "(a) For Inflection, this question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, they publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.\n\n(b) The question resolves as **YES** if [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) is generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, and **NO** otherwise.\n\n\"Generally available\" here means that the default state for people in the EU is that they can access it without a VPN (possibly requiring paying for it.)

Firstly, regarding Inflection's report, I'll consider their track record and the general pace of AI safety research. Inflection has been actively working on AI safety, and publishing a report with external red-teaming results would be a significant milestone. While there's no concrete evidence of an imminent report release, it's plausible that they'll make progress in this area given the importance of external validation for their models. However, without specific information on their current progress or timeline, I'll assign a moderate probability to this event. Secondly, regarding OpenAI's ChatGPT availability in the EU, I'll consider the company's previous experiences with regulatory compliance and market expansion. OpenAI has faced challenges with ChatGPT's availability in certain EU countries, but they've also demonstrated a willingness to adapt and comply with regulations. Given the importance of the EU market and the potential for significant revenue, I expect OpenAI to prioritize making ChatGPT generally available in the EU. However, regulatory hurdles and technical issues can still cause delays, so I'll assign a slightly lower probability to this event.

For (a), I'll consider the historical polling trends and the current state of the election. As of the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), the 538 national polling average shows a relatively close race between Trump and Biden. However, it's essential to note that the polling average can fluctuate over time due to various factors such as campaign events, debates, and economic conditions. To assess the likelihood of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, I'll consider the following: The current polling average is relatively close, with a narrow margin between Trump and Biden. Historically, polling averages can be volatile, and small changes in the margin can occur due to random sampling error or changes in voter sentiment. Given the relatively close race, it's possible that Trump's lead could be within the specified range on July 15, 2024. For (b), I'll examine the historical trends of the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) and its Year-over-Year changes. The St. Louis Fed provides data on this index, which measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 index over the next three months. To assess the likelihood of the VXVCLS being higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024, I'll consider the following: Historical data shows that the VXVCLS can be volatile, with significant changes in volatility occurring over time. The index tends to be higher during periods of market uncertainty or stress, such as during economic downturns or significant market events. Given the current economic conditions and market trends, it's possible that the VXVCLS could be higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024. Considering both conditions, I'll estimate the probability of both occurring. While there's some uncertainty surrounding both conditions, I'll assign a moderate probability to each condition occurring. Given the relatively close race and the potential for volatility in the polling average, I'll assign a 40% probability to Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024. For the VXVCLS being higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024, I'll assign a 30% probability, considering the historical trends and potential for market volatility.

Carlson is a well-known television personality and a polarizing figure, but I'm not aware of any information that would suggest he has a clear path to the nomination. In the 2020 Republican primaries, many less well-known candidates and political outsiders competed for the nomination, ultimately being overshadowed by better-funded and more established contenders. Additionally, the current field of prominent Republican contenders for the nomination includes a range of potential candidates who are widely considered to have stronger support from party voters. I therefore consider the likelihood of a relatively little-known personality, such as Carlson, managing to obtain the support required to become the party nominee to be quite low, especially without significant resources dedicated to running a full national campaign. However, past upsets and unforeseen events, such as George McGovern's win at the Democratic National Convention of 1972 or Robert F. Kennedy's emergence as the leading Democratic presidential candidate at the beginning of 1968, underscore the fluid nature of election politics and the need for caution. Although Tucker Carlson has recently expressed a passing interest in the Republican presidency, which is at times a long-standing fantasy within the national conversation. Although he seems unlikely, any number of candidates that currently seem relatively unknown and long shots like Tucker, as well as some people less well known outside a fairly small media and conservative policy circles like the Trump movement, also might ultimately do well under certain, currently unforeseeable circumstance where the situation for those, who the establishment had pegged from the very early stages on, turned disastrous. Overall, it remains to be seen who could ultimately stand at the very top on the primary slate, yet in evaluating our current climate of presidential contest, it remains far more reasonable to put on the current available, though limited pool of viable Republicans, even more distant and fringe elements or even out-of-left field choice that they likely will."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "f212ac61-7509-4bcd-9fa6-0d42b970cef7", "title": "Given Tucker Carlson is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, will Biden drop out before July 20?", "body": "This question examines the scenario where Tucker Carlson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

To estimate this probability, let's analyze the current presidential election cycle and the influence of figures like Tucker Carlson. Based on historical voting patterns, there is substantial evidence of grassroots dissatisfaction towards the 2020 Republican National Convention. Given this background, there's a slight chance of unconventional candidates or individuals who may not typically be in the running receiving the nomination. However, the influence of figures like Tucker Carlson in the nomination process should not be overlooked. Given the current context and considering that the scenario is relatively far-fetched, the probability of Carlson being nominated is low. The Republican National Convention would likely lean towards more establishment figures. I would argue that Carlson has a negligible chance of being nominated due to his lack of a traditional path to the presidency and his controversial public persona. Now, let's consider condition (b) - Biden dropping out before July 20. For this probability, we have to take into account factors such as Biden's past health concerns and his overall age, which could make him more susceptible to dropping out of the race early. Additionally, the possibility of him being challenged in the Democratic primaries or by a more energetic and capable candidate should be considered. However, as of now, it appears that Biden is likely to continue as the Democratic nominee. If we take into account past instances where incumbent presidents or candidates with strong support base have been challenged and were able to hold their position, we would estimate this probability slightly above 1/4 due to Joe Biden being known for remaining resilient, staying in election cycles often marked by various health controversies throughout his illustrious life in politics.

First, let's consider event (a). There is a report from People.com suggesting that Taylor Swift may play the role of Dazzler in the movie, but this has not been officially confirmed by the film's producers or the actress herself. Given the lack of concrete evidence, I would assign a relatively low probability to this event occurring, around 0.2 (20%). Next, let's consider event (b). The domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' needs to be higher than the combined box office openings of 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'The Wolverine' (2013). The combined box office openings for these two movies are $185,548,391. To estimate the probability of the new movie's opening being higher, we need to consider the typical box office performance of superhero movies, particularly those in the X-Men franchise. While it's difficult to predict the exact box office performance of a movie, we can look at the box office performance of other movies in the franchise. For example, the 2019 movie 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix' had a domestic box office opening of $65.7 million, which is lower than the combined box office openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine'. However, the 2016 movie 'Deadpool' had a domestic box office opening of $132.4 million, which is significantly higher than the combined box office openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine'. Given the success of the Deadpool franchise and the potential for a high box office opening, I would assign a moderate probability to this event occurring, around 0.5 (50%). Finally, to estimate the probability that both events occur, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event occurring separately. This gives us a probability of 0.2 x 0.5 = 0.1 (10%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.02588034706813352, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

ISS makes recommendations on a case-by-case basis, and the likelihood of them advising against both specific proposals seems moderate, based on the past behavior of ISS and considering the complexity of the pay package.

For condition (b), regarding Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, there are various factors to consider. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding public office. Trump's involvement in the January 6th Capitol attack and subsequent events might lead to legal challenges. However, the U.S. legal system and the political landscape are complex, and it's uncertain whether Trump would be removed or blocked from any state's primary ballot by July 15, 2024. Given the ongoing legal proceedings and the potential for various outcomes, I would estimate a moderate probability of Trump being removed or blocked from a state's primary ballot. Considering both conditions, the probability of both conditions being met is the product of their individual probabilities. However, since condition (a) has a low probability, the overall probability of the question resolving YES is also low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08929731592838709, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given the current field of candidates and the nomination process, I would estimate the probability of a brokered convention as around 0.4 (40%). This is based on the assumption that the current field of candidates will remain relatively stable and that the nomination process will be competitive. Secondly, for event (b), the probability of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20 depends on the current level of dissatisfaction with Biden's candidacy among Democratic Senators. While there may be some Senators who are dissatisfied with Biden's performance, it is unclear whether this dissatisfaction will reach a critical mass of 10 or more Senators.

To approach this, let's break down the information and reasoning step by step: 1. Independence of Events: The outcome of the 2024 NBA Finals is independent of the performance of the US basketball teams at the Paris Olympics. The NBA Finals are determined by the performance of the teams in the NBA season and playoffs, which are separate from the Olympic competitions. 2. Olympic Success Does Not Influence NBA Performance: The success of the US basketball teams in the Olympics does not directly influence the performance of any NBA team, including the Philadelphia 76ers, in the upcoming season or the playoffs. NBA teams are composed of professional players who compete in the league's regular season and playoffs, not in the Olympics. 3. No Logical Connection: There's no logical connection between the US winning gold in both Olympic basketball events and the Philadelphia 76ers winning the 2024 NBA Finals. The success in one domain (Olympic basketball) does not directly impact the outcome in another domain (the NBA Finals). 4. Random Chance: The outcome of the 2024 NBA Finals is determined by a variety of factors including team performance, player injuries, coaching strategies, and luck. The probability of the Philadelphia 76ers winning the championship is influenced by these factors, not by the outcome of the Olympics. Given these considerations, the probability of the Philadelphia 76ers winning the 2024 NBA Finals, given that the US wins gold in both Men's and Women's 5v5 basketball at the Paris Olympics, is essentially the same as the probability of them winning without any conditions.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden: Given the current time (July 26, 2024), we are about 12 days away from the resolution date (July 15, 2024). Historically, polling averages can fluctuate significantly in the months leading up to an election. However, it's difficult to predict the exact trajectory of the polls. To estimate the probability, I will assume that the polling average will be within a reasonable range. A Trump lead of 2-4 is a plausible scenario, given the current political climate.

First, I'll analyze the condition that Russia has control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024. Chasiv Yar is a small town in eastern Ukraine, and its control is indicated by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map. While ISW's assessments are based on various categories, including 'Assessed Russian Advance in Ukraine' and 'Assessed Russian Control,' I'm not aware of any specific information that links Chasiv Yar's control to the U.S. political landscape or Donald Trump's eligibility for federal office. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution disqualifies individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. However, the process of removing or blocking a candidate from a primary election ballot under this section would require a complex series of events, including a determination of insurrection or rebellion, a state's decision to remove the candidate, and official announcements or court decisions confirming the removal. Given the lack of a direct causal link between Russia's control of Chasiv Yar and the U.S. primary election process, I consider it unlikely that Donald Trump's removal from any state primary ballot for federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment would be a direct consequence of this event. However, I also consider the possibility that the question is asking for a more nuanced interpretation, where the control of Chasiv Yar might be seen as a proxy for broader geopolitical tensions or events that could influence U.S. domestic politics.

However, I can look at the current polling averages to get a sense of the current state of the election. 2. Current polling averages: As of my knowledge cutoff, the 538 national polling average shows Trump leading Biden by around 1-2 points. This suggests that a lead of 2-3 points is not entirely implausible, but it's also not a guaranteed outcome. 3. Polling variability: Polling averages can fluctuate over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, new information, or methodological differences between polls. This variability makes it challenging to predict the exact outcome on a specific date like July 15, 2024. 4. The narrow margin: The question specifies a narrow margin of 2-3 points, which is a relatively small range. This suggests that the outcome is likely to be close, and small changes in voter sentiment or polling methodology could tip the balance in either direction. 5.

If we consider the Republican primaries as a whole, a lead of this order might reinforce Trump's standing, particularly if he maintains a strong base of supporters and is able to withstand any potential challenges from within the party.

For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been actively promoting the agreement, and several countries have already expressed their support for it.

If Nvidia closes below $100 per share, it may indicate a decline in the tech sector and potentially a broader market downturn. This could lead to increased concerns about economic growth and inflation, which might cause investors to become more cautious and reduce their spending.

Condition (a) requires the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) to be higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024. The St. Louis Fed reports the historical data of this index. To estimate the probability of this condition, we need to consider the historical trend of the index and any potential factors that might influence its value on July 20, 2024. However, without access to real-time data or a specific model to forecast the future value of the index, we can only rely on general trends and patterns. Historically, the VXVCLS index has shown fluctuations, but it tends to be higher during periods of market uncertainty or increased volatility. As the index's value is influenced by various market and economic factors, it's challenging to predict its exact value on July 20, 2024. Nevertheless, considering the general trend and the fact that the index is designed to measure the market's expectation of future volatility, it's possible to assume that the index might be higher in the future, especially if market conditions remain uncertain or volatile. Condition (b) requires Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. The outcome of the nomination is influenced by various factors, including the Republican National Convention, the performance of candidates during the primaries, and the preferences of the delegates. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of the nomination with certainty, we can consider the current political landscape and the performance of Donald Trump in previous elections. Donald Trump has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, and his chances of being nominated again are not negligible. However, the Republican Party has become more diverse, and other candidates might also have a strong chance of being nominated. The outcome of the nomination will depend on various factors, including the performance of candidates during the primaries, the preferences of the delegates, and the overall political climate. Considering the uncertainty surrounding both conditions, we can estimate the probability of each condition occurring separately. However, to determine the probability that both conditions will occur, we need to consider the intersection of these probabilities. Assuming that the probability of condition (a) occurring is around 0.6 (60%), based on the general trend of the VXVCLS index and the potential for market uncertainty or increased volatility, we can estimate the probability of condition (b) occurring as around 0.4 (40%), considering the uncertainty surrounding the nomination process and the diversity of the Republican Party. To estimate the probability that both conditions will occur, we can use the multiplication rule of probability, which states that the probability of the intersection of two events is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.

Firstly, the event of Joe Biden dying before Saturday is a given condition. The probability of this event is not directly relevant to the question at hand, as it's a stated condition rather than a probability we need to estimate. However, it's essential to acknowledge that this condition removes any uncertainty about the transition of power in the US presidency. The key event of interest is the resignation or removal of the current Director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle. The Secret Service is a law enforcement agency within the US Department of Homeland Security. The agency's director is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In the event of a presidential transition, the director's position may become vacant, potentially leading to a resignation or removal. Given the condition that Joe Biden has died, the US would likely be in a period of presidential transition. Typically, in such scenarios, the outgoing administration's officials, including the head of the Secret Service, might be reassessed or replaced by the incoming administration. However, the specific circumstances of Biden's death and the subsequent transition process would influence the likelihood of the head of the Secret Service resigning. If the transition process is smooth and orderly, with a clear succession plan in place, the likelihood of the current director remaining in their position until October 12th might be higher. On the other hand, if the transition is contentious or if there's a significant change in administration policy, it could lead to a higher likelihood of the current director being removed or resigning before the specified date. Considering these factors, the probability of the head of the Secret Service resigning within the next 90 days, given Joe Biden's death, would depend on the specifics of the transition process, the policies of the incoming administration, and the circumstances surrounding the presidential transition. Given the lack of specific information about these factors, I will estimate the probability based on the general likelihood of a transition scenario leading to the removal or resignation of the current director. While there's a possibility of the current director remaining in their position for the specified period, the transition scenario following a presidential death is inherently uncertain, and the likelihood of significant changes in leadership roles is not negligible."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c69e4941-ba7c-4ad6-962f-4860f501341e", "title": "Will Joe Biden die before Saturday and will the head of the Secret Service resign within the next 90 days?", "body": "Resolves YES if both of the following occur: (a) There is an official announcement of Joe Biden's death before market close at the end of Friday, July 26th, and (b) Kimberly Cheatle, the Director of the U.S. Secret Service, resigns, is fired, or for any other reason no longer serves as the director of the Secret Service before October 12, 2024.

Additionally, the Democratic Party might prefer a younger candidate, and Biden's age (he will be 81 in 2024) could be a factor in their decision-making process. On the other hand, the Democratic Party has a history of supporting its incumbent presidents, and Biden has been a popular figure within the party. It's also worth noting that Biden has not shown any signs of wavering in his commitment to run for re-election. Given these factors, it's difficult to assign a high probability to Biden announcing that he won't accept the nomination. However, it's also unlikely that he would make such an announcement without a strong reason, such as health issues or a significant shift in the party's preferences. Considering these points, I would estimate the probability of Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President as around 0.1 (10%)."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "44c690c5-e5d0-4c49-be94-10a4e457f96d", "title": "Conditional on Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination, will there be another Democratic party presidential debate?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Before 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement that he will not seek and will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President for another term in the 2024 cycle.

First, a lead of 2-3 points is relatively modest, suggesting a competitive election. In such a scenario, both campaigns are likely to be highly active, with Biden possibly feeling pressure to stay in the public eye to maintain his visibility and credibility. This could lead to a higher likelihood of him accepting interview invitations, as he seeks to connect with voters and stay relevant. However, the specific condition of a 45+ minute in-person interview is more restrictive. While Biden might be inclined to participate in various media appearances, the requirement for at least 45 minutes of new footage being interviewed could be a challenge to meet. It is possible that he might opt for shorter, more controlled engagements, such as press conferences or speeches, which are not counted under the given criteria. Considering these factors, we should also note that the resolution date is July 31st, which gives Biden approximately two weeks to fulfill the condition. Given the competitive nature of the election and the potential for Biden to want to stay engaged with the public, it's plausible he could find time for a longer interview within this timeframe.

However, the likelihood of a 45-minute interview is harder to estimate, as it depends on various factors, including Biden's schedule, the availability of interview slots, and the willingness of hosts to conduct in-depth interviews. Given the context that Biden has had shorter interviews in the past, I will assign a lower probability to this condition occurring. However, it is still possible that he will participate in a longer interview, especially if it is with a prominent host or for a significant event.

Secondly, the listed Israeli leaders have been involved in various controversies and conflicts, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Benjamin Netanyahu, for instance, has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity related to Israel's actions in Gaza. Yoav Gallant and Herzi Halevi, as Defense Minister and IDF Chief of Staff, respectively, may also face scrutiny for their roles in military operations. Thirdly, the ICC has been investigating the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 2015, and there have been ongoing efforts to hold Israeli officials accountable for alleged war crimes.

Understanding the condition: The condition is that the ICC issues an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant, or Herzi Halevi before July 1, 2024. This is a specific, verifiable event that can be tracked by following the ICC's actions and announcements. 2. Understanding the outcome: The outcome is a terrorist attack that injures or kills at least one person (excluding the terrorist(s)) in metropolitan France between the Opening Ceremony (July 26, 2024) and the Closing Ceremony (August 11, 2024). The attack must be acknowledged by the French government or its officials. 3. Analyzing the relationship between the condition and the outcome: There's no direct, established relationship between the ICC issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders and the occurrence of a terrorist attack in metropolitan France. However, such an event could potentially increase tensions between Israel and France, or between Israel and groups in the Middle East that might retaliate against France. This could lead to an increased risk of a terrorist attack in France. On the other hand, the impact of such an event might be mitigated by various factors, including the robust security measures typically in place for major international events like the Olympics, diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, and the unpredictability of terrorist actions. 4. Assessing the likelihood of the condition being met: The likelihood of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for any of the listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024, is uncertain. It depends on various factors, including political will, legal proceedings, and international diplomatic efforts. However, given the recent history of the ICC's actions and the political climate, it's plausible to assume that there's a non-zero chance of such an event occurring. 5. Assessing the likelihood of the outcome given the condition is met: Given the condition is met, the likelihood of a terrorist attack in metropolitan France during the Olympics is still uncertain. However, the potential for increased tensions and the retaliatory actions by certain groups might slightly increase the risk. The exact probability is difficult to quantify without more specific information about the nature of the tensions, the response of the French government, and the effectiveness of security measures. 6. Combining the probabilities: Without more information about the specific circumstances and without a direct, established causal link between the ICC's actions and terrorist attacks, it's challenging to estimate a precise probability. However, for the sake of providing an answer, let's consider the potential for a slight increase in risk due to increased tensions and the possibility of retaliatory actions. This suggests a low to moderate increase in the risk of a terrorist attack, but not a substantial one, given the robust security measures and diplomatic efforts typically in place for such events."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "f935eaee-03f7-4f5b-96fa-e22be73de43f", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The ICC issues arrest warrants for listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024 (b) A terrorist act occurs in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as **Yes** if before July 1, 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issues a [warrant of arrest](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works) for any of the below listed Israeli cabinet members.

This could potentially appeal to swing voters and independents, making the election a close contest between Biden and Trump. However, it's essential to consider the current polling trends and the 2024 election landscape. As of my knowledge cutoff, the 2024 presidential election is still over a year away, and polling data is subject to significant fluctuations. However, based on historical trends and the current political climate, it's possible that Biden's popularity might have decreased due to various factors such as his age, the economy, and potential challenges from the Democratic primary. On the other hand, Trump's base remains strong, and he has a history of performing well in Republican primaries. Given these considerations, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether Biden would be the favorite on July 19, 2024. However, if we consider the historical trend of the FiveThirtyEight forecast, it often reflects the current polling data and the overall election landscape. If Tim Scott is the nominee, it's likely that the election would be competitive, and the FiveThirtyEight forecast might reflect this by making Biden and Trump close in the polls. Taking these factors into account, I would estimate that the probability of Biden being the favorite on July 19, 2024, with Tim Scott as the Republican nominee is around 40%.

First, let's consider the likelihood of Tim Scott being selected as the Republican nominee. As of now, it's difficult to predict with certainty who will be the Republican nominee, as the primary elections and caucuses have not yet taken place. However, Tim Scott is a well-known and respected figure within the Republican Party, and his chances of being selected as the nominee are not zero. I would estimate that the probability of Tim Scott being selected as the Republican nominee is around 10-20%. Next, let's consider the likelihood of FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024. FiveThirtyEight's election forecast is based on a complex model that takes into account various factors, including polling data, economic indicators, and historical trends. While it's impossible to predict with certainty how the election will play out, FiveThirtyEight's forecast has been a reliable indicator of election outcomes in the past. However, the forecast is subject to change based on new data and developments. Assuming that the forecast is based on a reasonable set of assumptions and data, I would estimate that the probability of FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024, is around 60-70%. Combining these two probabilities, we get a rough estimate of the overall probability of the question resolving as 'Yes'. However, since the two conditions are not independent, we need to consider the correlation between them. In this case, if Tim Scott is selected as the Republican nominee, it's possible that FiveThirtyEight may adjust their forecast to reflect his candidacy, which could affect the likelihood of Biden being projected as the favorite.

Given that we are looking at a specific date in the future, we can't know the exact polling numbers with certainty, but we can consider the general trends and the uncertainty surrounding polling data. The 538 national polling average is a commonly used metric for tracking presidential election polling, and it is updated regularly. However, predicting exactly how the polling numbers will change between now and July 15, 2024, is challenging, especially considering the many factors that can influence polling data, such as campaign events, candidate performances, and external factors like economic conditions and global events. For part (b), we are looking at the condition that Tim Scott will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. The Republican nomination process involves a series of primaries and caucuses across the United States, which will lead to a nomination at the Republican National Convention. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of these events with certainty, we can look at the current field of candidates and their past performances. Tim Scott is a US Senator from South Carolina and has been mentioned as a potential candidate, but the Republican nomination is often influenced by a variety of factors, including the candidate's name recognition, fundraising abilities, and the support of key party leaders and donors. Considering these points, I would estimate the probability of part (a) resolving as follows: The probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, is uncertain and depends on many factors that are difficult to predict.

Given that Francis Suarez is the Republican nominee, it is likely that the Republican Party will have a unified front behind their candidate. However, this does not necessarily imply that the Democratic Party will also have a unified front. In the US, the Democratic Party has a primary system where candidates compete against each other in various states. The candidate with the most delegates wins the nomination. However, if no candidate reaches the required number of delegates to win the nomination in the first round, the convention may become brokered. The key factor in determining the probability of a brokered convention is the number of candidates in the Democratic primary and their level of support. If there are multiple strong candidates with a significant number of delegates, it is more likely that the convention will become brokered. Currently, I do not have information on the specific candidates running in the Democratic primary or their level of support. However, I can provide a general assessment based on historical trends. In recent years, the Democratic Party has had a tendency towards a brokered convention, particularly in 2016 and 2020.

First, let's look at Francis Suarez's chances of being the Republican nominee. To be selected as the nominee, Suarez would need to win the majority of delegates at the Republican National Convention. While Suarez is a well-known figure in Republican politics, the Republican Party has a strong field of potential candidates, and the nomination process is highly unpredictable. Given the current pool of candidates and the fact that Suarez is not the most well-funded or established candidate, it's unlikely that he would be able to secure the majority of delegates. Regarding the possibility of a brokered convention for the Democrats, this would require a situation in which no candidate secures a majority of delegates by the time of the convention. This can happen when there are multiple strong candidates and no clear front-runner. While the Democratic field is competitive, it's possible that a clear frontrunner could emerge early in the process, reducing the likelihood of a brokered convention. However, considering the historical context and the current dynamics of the Democratic Party, it's not entirely impossible that a brokered convention could occur. The party has experienced brokered conventions in the past, and the nomination process can be highly fluid. Taking into account the above factors, I estimate the probability of Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election to be very low, around 2%. The probability of a brokered convention for the Democrats is slightly higher, around 10%.

In such a scenario, Biden's ability to accept the Democratic Party's nomination would be heavily scrutinized. If the declaration were to happen before August, it would be an even more significant concern, potentially leading to a swift reevaluation of Biden's viability as a candidate. There are a few key pieces of information that support a 'Yes' answer: 1. Biden would likely be facing a formal declaration of incapacitation. This would imply that a significant portion of his closest advisors and peers would doubt his ability to lead. It's difficult to envision a scenario where someone under such scrutiny would confidently continue to pursue the presidency. 2. In 1973, during Richard Nixon's presidency, after the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach him, he announced that he would resign. This precedent suggests that a president facing serious allegations or incapacitation may be more likely to step down than to continue in the role. 3. The Democratic Party's primary process is highly competitive, and the party has historically been willing to consider alternatives to its incumbent president when faced with significant challenges. However, there are also several factors that suggest a 'No' answer: 1. The 25th Amendment Section 4 is a rare and unprecedented event. It is unlikely that the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet would invoke this section without a compelling reason. This could be a desperate attempt to save the administration, rather than a genuine assessment of Biden's ability to lead. 2. The Democratic Party is known for its loyalty to its incumbent president. They may be reluctant to abandon Biden, even if he is declared incapacitated, in order to avoid a potentially divisive primary process. 3. The political climate in 2024 is highly uncertain. It's possible that the situation could be managed in such a way that Biden could continue to lead without serious consequences.

Jared Huffman, and several lawmakers have expressed their opposition to the plan. This suggests a strong likelihood of at least 20 House Democrats signing the letter.

Additionally, we need to account for the possibility of Senators also signing the letter, which might be less likely due to their different dynamics and priorities. For condition (b), a brokered convention typically requires significant divisions within the party, often resulting from a lack of a clear frontrunner or a strong preference for an alternative candidate. Given the ongoing debate about Biden's candidacy, there is a plausible scenario where the party could be divided, leading to a brokered convention. However, the party's ability to unify behind a candidate is a significant factor, and it's uncertain whether the divisions would be severe enough to prevent a single-ballot nomination. Considering both conditions, the joint probability is influenced by the potential overlap between the two events. If a significant number of Democrats sign the letter opposing the early nomination (condition a), it could indicate deeper divisions within the party, increasing the likelihood of a brokered convention (condition b).

In the 2024 election, the Democratic Party has a large and diverse field of candidates, which increases the likelihood of a brokered convention.

For (a), a brokered convention in the Democratic Party typically occurs when no candidate secures a majority of the delegates through the primary elections, forcing the party to hold multiple rounds of voting to select a nominee. The likelihood of this happening in 2024 depends on various factors, including the number of candidates, their popularity, and the primary election schedule. Given the current landscape, I assess the probability of a brokered convention as relatively low, as the Democratic Party has a large and diverse field of candidates, but none have yet gained significant traction. However, without more specific information about the candidates' standings and the primary election schedule, I will assign a moderate probability for this event. For (b), the condition of at least 20 House or Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the early nomination plan by market close on July 21st is more quantifiable. While it is difficult to predict the exact number of lawmakers who will sign such a letter, I consider the probability of this event as relatively low. The Democratic Party is generally unified behind President Biden, and the early nomination plan is likely to be seen as a way to ensure a smooth transition and maintain party cohesion. However, there may be some dissenting voices within the party, particularly among those who have been critical of Biden's leadership or have their own presidential ambitions.

To estimate this, we must first find out how many teams participate in each sport and what the distribution of NOC gold medals might look like in each sport.

We can use this data to estimate the probability of the same NOC winning more than one gold in the 8 team sports.

Firstly, let's consider the probability of a woman being nominated as the Democratic Presidential candidate. In recent US presidential elections, there has been a trend of increasing diversity in the party's nominees, with a higher likelihood of women being nominated. However, the Democratic Party has a history of selecting a diverse range of candidates, and it's difficult to predict with certainty who will be nominated. Given the current pool of potential candidates, I would estimate a moderate probability of a woman being nominated. Secondly, let's consider the probability of a single nation winning more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics. The Olympics are a global event with many top-level teams competing, and it's challenging to predict which teams will perform well. However, some nations have a strong track record in women's team sports, such as the United States, Australia, and Great Britain. Given the competitiveness of the Olympics and the strength of these teams, I would estimate a moderate probability of a single nation winning more than one event. To estimate the probability of both events occurring, we need to consider the intersection of these two probabilities. Since the two events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities together. However, we need to consider the fact that the probability of a single nation winning more than one event is not a straightforward calculation, as it depends on the performance of multiple teams. A more realistic approach would be to estimate the probability of a single nation winning at least two events and then adjust for the fact that this is a more specific outcome. Based on these considerations, I would estimate the probability of a woman being nominated as the Democratic Presidential candidate at around 0.6 (60%), and the probability of a single nation winning more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics at around 0.3 (30%).

While it's possible that a challenger could emerge, the convention's delegates have historically been loyal to the front-runner or the candidate with the most momentum. 4. Potential challengers: While there may be other candidates who could potentially challenge Trump, none have yet emerged as a strong alternative. The Republican Party has struggled to find a viable candidate to take on Trump in the past, and it's unclear whether anyone will be able to mount a serious challenge in 2024. 5. Trump's own ambitions: Trump has not ruled out running for president again and has hinted at his interest in seeking the Republican nomination in 2024.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the stock market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including economic indicators, global events, and political climate. However, the impact of a presidential election on the stock market is often more significant than other events. In the context of India, the BSE SENSEX is a leading indicator of the Indian stock market's performance. The BSE SENSEX is a market-capitalization-weighted stock market index of 30 of the largest and most liquid stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). It is widely regarded as the bellwether of the Indian stock market. Donald Trump's presidency in the US had a significant impact on the global economy and stock markets. His policies, such as tax cuts and deregulation, had a positive impact on the US economy, which in turn influenced global markets. However, his presidency was also marked by controversies and uncertainties, which contributed to market volatility. Considering the specific scenario where Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, it's challenging to predict the exact impact on the BSE SENSEX. However, given his presidency's history of affecting global markets, it's plausible that his nomination could have some influence on the BSE SENSEX.

The BSE SENSEX has historically been influenced by various domestic and global factors, including economic indicators, government policies, and geopolitical events. Given the lack of direct information linking Donald Trump's nomination to the BSE SENSEX's performance, and without specific economic indicators or events that would significantly influence the BSE SENSEX's value, I will rely on general market trends and the assumption that the BSE SENSEX's performance is influenced by a wide range of factors."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "99b84123-bda4-4103-a6a2-0e6c8aaee3d6", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election and (b) On July 21, 2024, the closing value of BSE SENSEX is greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

While Trump has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, his nomination is not a certainty. However, given his past performances and the current state of the party, I would assign a moderate probability to his nomination. For part (b), the probability of the BSE SENSEX closing value being within the specified range is a more straightforward statistical problem. The SENSEX is a widely followed stock market index, and its value is influenced by various macroeconomic factors, including GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates. While it's challenging to predict the exact closing value of the SENSEX on a specific date, we can use historical data and trends to estimate the probability of it being within a certain range.

The polling average on July 15, 2024, is a snapshot of the polling data up to that point, which might not directly correlate with the trend lines on July 19, 2024. Given that the FiveThirtyEight model is based on trend lines and polling averages, and considering that the polling average on July 15, 2024, is a snapshot of the data up to that point, it is reasonable to assume that the polling average on July 15, 2024, is more likely to reflect a tighter race than the trend lines on July 19, 2024, which might show Biden as the favorite. However, the question asks for a specific range of Trump's lead (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4). The fact that Biden is the favorite on July 19, 2024, suggests that his trend lines are stronger, but it does not guarantee that the polling average on July 15, 2024, will show a significant lead by Trump. In fact, it is possible that the polling average on July 15, 2024, could show a very tight race, with Biden still being favored but with a small lead. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability that Trump's lead over Biden will be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, as relatively low, around 0.2. This is because the information provided does not strongly suggest a large lead by Trump on July 15, 2024, and the polling average on that date is more likely to reflect a tighter race than the trend lines on July 19, 2024."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "7dd95894-6682-4483-b87d-0dfb652c6d89", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) 538 project Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024, and (b) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "(a) Joe Biden will have a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Donald Trump according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for the day of July 19, 2024.

For condition (a), we need to assess the probability that Joe Biden will be the favorite on July 19, 2024, according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast. This requires analyzing the historical trends and fluctuations in the forecast, as well as any potential changes in the methodology that might impact the outcome. For condition (b), we need to evaluate the probability that Trump's lead over Biden will be between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, based on the national polling average.

We also need to account for the fact that the resolution date is July 22, 2024, and the data for July 19 might not be available, in which case the resolution will be based on the nearest previous figures. Given the complexity of these tasks, I will provide a detailed breakdown of my reasoning: 1. For condition (a), I will consider the historical trends in the FiveThirtyEight forecast, which have shown a general stability in the odds of the candidates winning. However, there may be fluctuations due to various factors such as campaign events, new information, or changes in public opinion. To estimate the probability, I will use a combination of historical data and expert judgment. 2. For condition (b), I will analyze the historical polling data for the 2024 presidential election, focusing on the national polling average and the range of Trump's lead over Biden. I will also consider any potential biases or variations in the polling methodology that might impact the outcome. 3. To combine the probabilities for both conditions, I will use a logical AND operation, as both conditions need to occur for the overall question to resolve as YES. Based on my analysis, I estimate the probability of condition (a) as 0.6, as there is a reasonable chance that Biden will be the favorite on July 19, 2024, given the historical trends and the general stability of the FiveThirtyEight forecast. Based on my analysis, I estimate the probability of condition (b) as 0.4, as there is a reasonable chance that Trump's lead will be between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, given the historical polling data and the range of possible outcomes.

This condition is currently uncertain, but I'll assume it holds for the sake of this estimation. Given that the condition is met, the likelihood of opposition to the early nomination plan within the Democratic Party depends on several factors: 1. Party dynamics: The Democratic Party has a diverse range of views, and opposition to the early nomination plan might come from various factions, including progressive and moderate Democrats. However, the party is generally united behind Biden, and opposition to the plan might be limited. 2. Public opinion: If public opinion is strongly against the early nomination plan, it could embolden Democrats to speak out against it. However, without current data on public opinion, it's difficult to assess the impact. 3. Leadership support: If party leaders, such as Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer, oppose the early nomination plan, it could create a ripple effect among rank-and-file members. However, without explicit statements from these leaders, it's uncertain whether they would publicly oppose the plan. 4. Alternative options: If Democrats have alternative plans or strategies to address the nomination process, it might reduce the need for a public letter opposing the early plan. Considering these factors, while there might be some opposition to the early nomination plan, it's uncertain whether it would be significant enough to meet the threshold of 20 signatures. Without explicit statements from key party leaders or public opinion data, it's challenging to estimate the likelihood of this outcome.

Assuming Biden serves two full terms, he would be term-limited out of office by the end of 2024. However, if Biden were to be impeached and removed from office before the end of his term, he would not be term-limited out. Impeachment and removal are highly unlikely but not impossible.

The likelihood of at least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing such a letter is uncertain but can be informed by the political climate, party dynamics, and the specific issues surrounding the nomination plan.

Firstly, let's assess the likelihood of Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial. Given the high-profile nature of the trial and Trump's history of making statements that generate controversy, it's likely that he will testify. However, without specific information on the trial's schedule or Trump's intentions, we can't assign a precise probability to this event. For the sake of argument, let's assume a moderate likelihood of 0.7 (70%). Next, we need to consider the likelihood of Iran initiating military action on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory between July 30 and August 12, 2024. This requires an assessment of Iran's military capabilities, its goals and motivations, and the geopolitical context. Given the current tensions between Iran and Israel, as well as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, it's possible that Iran might initiate military action. However, without specific information on Iran's plans or intentions, we can't assign a precise probability to this event. For the sake of argument, let's assume a moderate likelihood of 0.3 (30%). Now, let's consider the potential correlation between the two events. If Donald Trump testifies at the hush money trial, it's possible that his statements or actions might have some impact on the geopolitical situation, potentially influencing Iran's decisions. However, without specific information on how Trump's testimony might affect Iran's actions, we can't assign a precise probability to this correlation. For the sake of argument, let's assume a moderate likelihood of 0.2 (20%) that Trump's testimony will have some impact on Iran's actions. Given these assumptions, we can estimate the probability that Iran will initiate military action before August 13th midnight Eastern Time, given that Donald Trump testifies at the hush money trial. This requires a combination of the probabilities of each event occurring independently and the potential correlation between them. Using a simple Bayesian approach, we can estimate the probability as follows: P(Iran initiates military action | Trump testifies) = P(Iran initiates military action) * P(Trump testifies) + P(Iran initiates military action) * P(Trump testifies) * P(correlation) = 0.3 * 0.7 + 0.3 * 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.21 + 0.042 = 0.252"}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "a834cc91-a1c2-4f03-94c5-52c1daecce64", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Will Donald Trump testify at the hush money trial?

Firstly, regarding the likelihood of Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial, we know that the trial is currently ongoing, and there have been no credible reports suggesting that Trump has testified. However, it's essential to note that Trump has a history of making dramatic entrances and announcements, so it's possible that he might decide to testify unexpectedly. On the other hand, Trump's lawyers and representatives have not indicated that he plans to testify. Considering these factors, I would assign a moderate probability to Trump testifying, around 30-40%.

The market statement specifies that a military response will be considered any use of force executed by Iran on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory, officially acknowledged by the Iranian government or a consensus of credible reporting. Given the current tensions between Iran and Israel, as well as the presence of proxy forces in the region, there is a non-negligible risk of military escalation. However, predicting the exact timing and circumstances of such an event is challenging. Based on historical patterns and current trends, I would assign a slightly higher probability to Iran initiating a military response, around 40-50%.

Firstly, the probability of Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee is difficult to estimate due to the lack of clear information on the current nomination process and the preferences of the Republican delegates. However, we can consider some general trends and facts: Francis Suarez is the current Mayor of Miami, Florida, and has gained attention for his conservative policies and his ability to mobilize the Hispanic vote in Florida. The Republican primary is expected to be competitive, with several strong candidates vying for the nomination. The current polling suggests that Suarez is a dark horse candidate, but he has a relatively low level of name recognition and support among Republican voters. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee as around 0.05 (5%). This is a rough estimate and should be taken as a rough order of magnitude. Secondly, the probability of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20 can be estimated based on the current trends and the resolution source provided: The resolution source is a live tracker of Democratic Senators who have called for Biden to drop out, and it shows that currently, only a handful of Senators have expressed support for this. The tracker is updated regularly, and it is likely that more Senators will be added to the list as the election approaches. However, it is also possible that some Senators who have expressed support for Biden may change their minds or remain silent on the issue. Based on these factors, I would estimate the probability of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20 as around 0.3 (30%).

Multiplying these two probabilities together, we get: 0.05 (probability of Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee) x 0.3 (probability of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out) = 0.015.

Firstly, Disney has a history of announcing new attractions and rides at D23, and Moana is a popular franchise with a dedicated fan base. However, the fact that the resolution is specific to Magic Kingdom and not a general announcement for any theme park in Florida or elsewhere suggests that Disney might be trying to create a sense of exclusivity around the announcement. On the other hand, the fact that betting closes on August 8, the day before the convention, suggests that Disney might be trying to create a sense of uncertainty around the announcement, which could be beneficial for the betting market.

Firstly, let's consider the probability of Disney announcing a new Moana-themed ride for Magic Kingdom at or before D23 2024. D23 is a bi-annual convention where Disney often announces new projects and updates. Given the popularity of the Moana franchise and the fact that Disney tends to announce new rides and attractions at D23, I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as high, around 70-80%. However, it's essential to note that this is a relatively subjective estimate and may not be universally agreed upon. Secondly, let's consider the probability of 'Deadpool x Wolverine' grossing more than $284.5M globally in its opening weekend and being reported as the record for an R-rated movie release by the Hollywood Reporter or equivalent publication. This is a more complex prediction, as it depends on various factors such as the movie's marketing campaign, competition from other releases, and the audience's response to the film. Given the popularity of the Deadpool and Wolverine franchises, I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as low to moderate, around 20-30%. Again, this is a relatively subjective estimate and may vary depending on the individual's assessment of the movie's chances. Given these independent estimates, the overall probability of the question resolving YES is the product of these two probabilities.

However, past elections have shown that polling trends can be relatively stable in the months leading up to the election. If we look at the 2020 election, Biden's lead over Trump was relatively stable in the last few months before the election, with a narrow margin of around 4-5 points. 2. Current polling: As of my knowledge cutoff, the national polling average has Trump leading Biden by around 1-2 points, with some polls showing a larger lead and others a smaller one. This variability suggests that the lead is not yet locked in and could fluctuate in the coming months. 3. Election cycle: Presidential elections often see a surge in support for the incumbent party's candidate in the first few months after the midterms, which might give Trump a slight boost. However, this effect is not guaranteed and may be offset by other factors such as the Democratic Party's mobilization efforts. 4. 538's polling methodology: FiveThirtyEight's polling average is considered a reliable indicator of national sentiment, as it aggregates data from multiple reputable pollsters and weights them according to their historical accuracy.

Firstly, there is no direct causal link between the US presidential election and Israel's military actions. Israel's decisions on military actions are primarily driven by its national security interests and regional dynamics. However, we can consider the potential indirect effects of the US presidential election on Israel's actions. A Trump presidency might lead to a more hawkish US foreign policy, which could embolden Israel to take more aggressive actions in the region. On the other hand, a Biden presidency might lead to a more dovish US foreign policy, which could restrain Israel's actions. Given that Trump's lead over Biden is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, this suggests that Trump is likely to win the election. If Trump wins, it's possible that Israel might feel more confident in taking military actions, including a deadly attack within Iran. However, there are many other factors that could influence Israel's decision to carry out a deadly attack, including Iran's nuclear program, regional tensions, and domestic Israeli politics.

For the first condition, I'll consider the historical polling trends and the general uncertainty in polling averages. The 538 national polling average is subject to fluctuations due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, new information, and sampling errors. However, the lead of a sitting president (or a well-known candidate like Trump) in the national polls is generally not that large, and it's reasonable to expect some variation. Given the context of the 2024 election, I'd estimate the probability of Trump's lead being within the specified range on July 15, 2024, as around 20-30%. This is because the lead is relatively narrow and could be influenced by various factors, including external events and the campaign dynamics. For the second condition, I'll consider the geopolitical context and the historical patterns of Israeli military actions. Israel has been known to carry out targeted attacks in the region, and Iran has been a frequent target of such actions.

The index measures the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index over the next three months, which can be affected by various market and economic conditions such as interest rates, stock market performance, and inflation expectations. Historically, the VXVCLS index has shown a positive trend, with some fluctuations during times of market stress. However, it's also subject to volatility itself. Looking at the data available from the St. Louis Fed, I see that the index has been ranging between 20 and 50 over the past year.

Given the information above, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether VXVCLS will be higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024. However, to make an educated guess based on historical trends, if we consider the general movement of the index over a year, it's often influenced by the overall volatility in the market, the expectations for future market trends, and the level of risk investors are willing to take on. Without making assumptions or predictions about specific future market conditions, such as a potential recession, economic downturn, or sudden shift in investor sentiment that might affect the index value, it's difficult to assert a high probability. Nonetheless, given the propensity of implied volatility indexes like VXVCLS to remain at relatively high levels especially in uncertain economic times or times of market stress (even though we don't know what the future economic times or market stress points are), I lean on a slight bias towards anticipating the possibility of the index being higher due to the historical tendency of such indexes to fluctuate and sometimes remain at higher levels during times of uncertainty."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "fafb22c4-91af-464a-94c3-e43f165f69a1", "title": "Conditional on the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index being higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024, will Israel carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024?", "body": "This question combines two conditions:\n\n1. **Condition**: The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) must be higher on July 20, 2024, than it was on July 20, 2023.

However, there is no clear indication that he will resign or be unable to complete his term due to health reasons. In fact, he has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. Therefore, I would assign a high probability to him remaining President through the end of July 2024. Next, let's consider condition (b). Ron DeSantis is a prominent Republican figure and has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2024 presidential election. However, the Republican nomination process is complex and influenced by various factors, including party politics, fundraising, and public opinion.

Firstly, I'll consider the potential impact of the in-person interview on Biden's polling numbers. A 45-minute in-person interview can provide an opportunity for Biden to connect with the public, showcase his personality, and address key issues, potentially improving his image and appeal. This could lead to a slight increase in his popularity, making it less likely that Trump's lead will be greater than 3 points. However, it's essential to note that the impact of a single event, like an interview, on a presidential candidate's polling numbers is typically limited and short-lived. The effects might be negligible or even offset by other factors, such as ongoing campaign events, debates, or external events that could influence public opinion. Considering the relatively short timeframe between the interview and the specified date (July 15, 2024), it's uncertain whether the interview will have a significant lasting impact on the polling numbers. Additionally, the 538 national polling average is an aggregation of multiple polls, which can be influenced by various factors, including sampling errors, methodology differences, and respondent biases.

Firstly, the probability of Joe Biden having an in-person interview for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024 is relatively high. As a presidential candidate, Biden is likely to engage in various media appearances to boost his campaign. Given the specified conditions (excluding press conferences, speeches, rallies, fundraisers, town halls, etc.), it's plausible that he will participate in a podcast, late-night show, or a show like 60 Minutes. The exclusions listed in the question suggest that the question is looking for a more informal, in-depth interview setting, which is not uncommon for presidential candidates. Secondly, the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, is more uncertain. The polling average on Metaculus is subject to fluctuations and may be influenced by various factors such as campaign events, debates, and other external factors.

Another factor to consider is the number of neutral athletes participating in the Paris 2024 Olympics. If the number of participating neutral athletes is significantly higher than in previous Olympics, it is more likely that they will win a larger number of gold medals.

Although I don't have real-time information, I can provide a general perspective on the likelihood of Joe Biden's mortality within the given timeframe. Given the average life expectancy in the US, a 78-year-old person's mortality rate is relatively high. However, it's essential to note that life expectancy can be influenced by various factors, including health conditions, lifestyle, and access to quality medical care. Since I don't have real-time information on Joe Biden's current health status, I will rely on general demographic data. Assuming Nikki Haley is the Republican nominee, which is a separate event from Joe Biden's health, we can consider the general probability of a 78-year-old person passing away within a few months. A commonly cited mortality rate for 78-year-olds in the US is around 10-15% within the next year. Since we're looking at a specific date (Friday, July 26th), we need to adjust this rate to a shorter timeframe. A rough estimate would be to assume a monthly mortality rate of approximately 0.7-1% for a 78-year-old person. Using this rough estimate, we can calculate the probability of Joe Biden dying before Saturday, given that Nikki Haley is the Republican nominee, as follows: Monthly mortality rate for a 78-year-old: 0.8% (avg of 0.7-1%) Probability of dying before Saturday (July 26th to August 1st): approximately 0.8% * 6 days \u2248 0.0048 or 0.48%.

First, let's consider the number of countries that have never won an Olympic gold medal. According to the Olympic Games' history, there are around 200 countries that have participated in the Olympics, and about 150 of them have never won a gold medal. Assuming that the number of countries winning their debut gold medal is a binomial distribution, we can estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal. Let's assume that the probability of a country winning its debut gold medal is around 0.05 (based on historical data). Using the binomial distribution, we can estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal to be around 0.23. Next, let's consider the probability of Individual Neutral Athletes winning at least 15 gold medals. The number of gold medals won by Individual Neutral Athletes has been increasing over the years, and it's difficult to predict the exact number for the Paris 2024 Olympics. However, we can look at the trend and make an educated guess. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Individual Neutral Athletes won 17 gold medals. Assuming a similar trend, we can estimate the probability of Individual Neutral Athletes winning at least 15 gold medals to be around 0.65. Now, let's combine the two probabilities.

Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of at least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the early nomination plan is around 0.4 (40%). For the second part of the question, regarding a brokered convention in 2024, I consider the following factors: 1. The fact that the Democratic Party has a relatively large number of candidates, which increases the likelihood of a contested convention. 2. The potential for a significant number of delegates to be uncommitted or to switch their support to a different candidate during the convention. However, I also consider the following factors that might reduce the probability: 1. The party's efforts to maintain unity and avoid a contested convention, which could lead to a smooth nomination process. 2. The fact that the convention is still several months away, which gives the party time to address any potential issues and avoid a brokered convention. Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of a brokered convention in 2024 is around 0.6 (60%). Since the two parts of the question are independent, I multiply the probabilities to get the overall probability of the combined question resolving YES. Therefore, the probability that at least 20 House/Senate Democrats will sign a public letter opposing the early nomination plan and the Democratic Party will have a brokered convention in 2024 is around 0.4 x 0.6 = 0.24 (24%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.22875890834475998, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

To answer this, we need to consider the implications of Ted Cruz being the nominee on the electoral landscape. Firstly, Ted Cruz is a conservative Republican, and his nomination would likely make the election more competitive in certain states that tend to vote Republican. However, it's essential to consider that Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee, and her campaign would likely focus on appealing to moderate voters and independents. Nate Silver's model takes into account various factors, including polling data, economic indicators, and historical trends. If Ted Cruz is the nominee, it's possible that his conservative platform might appeal to some voters who might otherwise support the Democratic candidate. However, it's also possible that the nomination of Cruz would energize the Democratic base, leading to increased enthusiasm and turnout. Given these considerations, it's challenging to predict how Nate Silver's model would respond to Ted Cruz being the nominee. However, we can look at the general trend of Nate Silver's model. In the past, his model has often adjusted to reflect changes in the election landscape, including shifts in the nominees or significant events. Assuming that Nate Silver's model is well-calibrated and responsive to changes in the election landscape, it's possible that the model would adjust Kamala Harris's odds of winning if Ted Cruz is the nominee. However, without specific information on how the model reacts to such a scenario, we can't be certain.

For part (a), I will consider the general trend of IMDB ratings for the first 7 episodes of Season 2, which show a slight decline from the peak of E7 (9.1) to E6 (6.1). However, the ratings have been increasing again with E8 (9.3) and E9 (8.7). Given that the final episode of the season (S2E8) has a high rating, it is likely that the finale, which is often highly anticipated and discussed, will have a high rating as well. Furthermore, the season finale often receives a boost in ratings compared to the rest of the season. Therefore, I assign a high probability to the event that S2E8 will be rated >8.5 on IMDB.

First, let's consider the likelihood of Kalenjin athletes winning the men's and women's marathons. The Kalenjin people are a prominent ethnic group from Kenya known for their exceptional athletic abilities, particularly in distance running. Historically, they have produced many world-class marathon runners, including multiple Olympic champions. Given their dominance in the sport, it's reasonable to assume that they will continue to have a strong presence in the marathon events at the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, it's difficult to predict the specific winners, as it depends on various factors such as training, competition, and course conditions. Assuming that Kalenjin athletes will be strong contenders, I'll assign a probability of 0.7 to the event of both men's and women's marathon winners having Kalenjin roots. This is a conservative estimate, as it's possible that other athletes from other ethnic groups or countries might also perform exceptionally well. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Sifan Hassan winning a medal. Sifan Hassan is a talented middle- and long-distance runner from the Netherlands, but she has not shown the same level of dominance in the marathon as some of the top Kalenjin athletes. While she has had success in shorter distances, the marathon is a different beast, and her chances of winning a medal in the 2024 Paris Olympics are uncertain. I'll assign a probability of 0.4 to Sifan Hassan winning a medal, considering her past performance and the competitiveness of the women's marathon field. Now, to estimate the probability of both conditions being met, I'll multiply the probabilities of each condition. This assumes that the two events are independent, which might not be the case, but it's a reasonable simplification for this analysis."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0976087442698424, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03253624808994746, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.460335672850556, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For condition (a), Liz Cheney becoming the Republican nominee, we need to consider her current position and the dynamics of the Republican primary election. Liz Cheney is a prominent figure in the Republican Party, but she has been a vocal critic of former President Trump, which may make her a long shot for the nomination. While she has a strong conservative record and a loyal following, the Republican Party has shifted significantly to the right in recent years, making it difficult for a moderate like Cheney to secure the nomination. Additionally, other candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley are likely to be strong contenders for the nomination. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of Liz Cheney becoming the Republican nominee as around 10-15%. This is a relatively low probability due to the competitive nature of the Republican primary and the party's shift to the right. For condition (b), Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination, we need to consider his current intentions and the dynamics of the Democratic primary election. Joe Biden has not publicly ruled out a re-election bid, but he has also not made any definitive statements about his intentions. The Democratic Party is likely to be a crowded and competitive primary, with several strong contenders like Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and Bernie Sanders. Given Biden's age and the increasing number of Democratic candidates, it's possible that he may decide not to seek re-election. However, it's also possible that he may choose to run again, especially if he feels he can win the nomination. Without clear signals from Biden or his campaign, it's difficult to estimate the probability of him announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination. However, I would estimate the probability of this event as around 20-25%, as it's not entirely implausible that Biden may decide not to run again.

Firstly, such an announcement would likely be a significant event, potentially leading to market volatility. The impact of the announcement on the USD/JPY exchange rate would depend on various factors, including the market's perception of its implications for the US economy, global trade, and the potential leadership vacuum in the US. Historically, significant political events, especially those involving the US presidency, can have a substantial impact on currency markets.

In this case, the announcement might lead to a short-term increase in the USD/JPY exchange rate due to potential safe-haven demand for the USD.

The ICC's jurisdiction and potential for issuing arrest warrants: The ICC has the authority to investigate and prosecute individuals for international crimes, but its jurisdiction is limited to situations where a country is unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute itself. Israel is a non-signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, and has not ratified the treaty. However, the ICC can still exercise jurisdiction if the UN Security Council refers the situation to the ICC, or if the situation is referred by a State Party to the Rome Statute. 2. The likelihood of the ICC taking action against Israeli leaders: The ICC has a history of investigating and prosecuting individuals from non-signatory states, but it has also faced significant challenges and pushback from the international community, particularly from the US and other Western countries. The ICC's ability to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders would depend on various factors, including the level of international support, the strength of evidence, and the willingness of states to enforce the warrants. 3. The specific circumstances of Biden's incapacitation: The question specifies that Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024, which would likely have significant implications for US foreign policy and international relations. However, it is unclear how this would directly impact the ICC's decision-making or ability to issue arrest warrants. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of the ICC issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024, as follows: The ICC's jurisdiction and potential for issuing arrest warrants are uncertain and depend on various factors, including international cooperation and the strength of evidence. The likelihood of the ICC taking action against Israeli leaders is low, given the country's non-signatory status and the potential for pushback from the international community. However, the specific circumstances of Biden's incapacitation could potentially create a unique situation that might influence the ICC's decision-making.

Condition (1) is related to Joe Biden's announcement. Given that the question specifies a specific date (July 15, 2024) and a clear condition for resolution (a definitive public announcement), I will consider the probability of Joe Biden making such an announcement before the specified date. Historically, presidential candidates often make their intentions clear well in advance of the election, but there is no clear precedent for a candidate announcing they will not accept the nomination. However, it is not entirely impossible, especially if Joe Biden's health or personal reasons make it difficult for him to continue his campaign. Given the uncertainty surrounding Joe Biden's health and the fact that he has not publicly ruled out running, I would estimate the probability of condition (1) occurring as around 0.2 (20%).

To estimate the probability of this occurring, I will consider the current state of the Republican primary and the likelihood of Chris Christie winning the nomination. As of my knowledge cutoff, Chris Christie is not a leading candidate in the Republican primary, and it is unclear whether he will even make a serious run for the nomination. However, the Republican primary is still in its early stages, and it is possible that Chris Christie could gain momentum or that other candidates could falter, allowing him to become a viable contender. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Republican primary and the fact that Chris Christie is not currently a leading candidate, I would estimate the probability of condition (2) occurring as around 0.1 (10%). This is a relatively low probability, as it would require a significant shift in the dynamics of the Republican primary.

However, there is no clear connection between the box office performance of a movie and the IMDB rating of a TV show episode. Box office performance is a measure of a movie's commercial success, while IMDB ratings are a measure of audience satisfaction and critical acclaim.

For condition (b), I will use the historical IMDB ratings for the previous episodes of 'House of the Dragon' to make an educated guess about the rating of S2E8. Based on the historical data, the IMDB ratings for the previous episodes of 'House of the Dragon' have been quite high, with most episodes receiving ratings above 8.0. However, there is some variation in the ratings, and it's difficult to predict with certainty how the audience will react to S2E8. Given that the previous season finale (E8) received a rating of 9.3, it's possible that S2E8 could also receive a high rating. However, it's also possible that the rating could be lower due to various factors such as changes in the show's direction, character development, or plot twists. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability that the domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will be higher than the combined box office openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' as 0.8 (80%). This is based on the assumption that the box office data for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is available and that its opening will be higher than the combined opening of the two previous movies. For condition (b), I estimate the probability that 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 will be rated >8.5 on IMDB as 0.4 (40%). This is based on the historical IMDB ratings for the previous episodes of the show, which have been generally high but with some variation. While it's possible that S2E8 could receive a high rating, it's also possible that the rating could be lower due to various factors.

First, let's consider Joe Biden's announcement. There is no clear indication that Joe Biden plans to resign before the end of his term. In fact, he has not publicly stated any intention to do so. However, it's also difficult to predict with certainty what he might do in the future. Considering his age and potential health issues, it's possible that he might choose to step down, but it's not a likelihood that can be estimated with high precision. On the other hand, Donald Trump has a history of facing legal troubles, and it's not unlikely that he could be charged with witness tampering in Georgia. The specific case in question, 'The State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump, et al,' has been ongoing, and there have been reports of ongoing investigations. However, without more information, it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of an indictment before June 1, 2024. Combining these two events, it's difficult to estimate the overall probability. However, since both events are relatively independent, we can use the product rule of probability. Assuming that the probability of Joe Biden announcing his resignation is around 0.2 (a rough estimate, given the uncertainty) and the probability of Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering is around 0.4 (a rough estimate, given the ongoing investigations), the overall probability would be the product of these two numbers: 0.2 x 0.4 = 0.08."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.02010729997152383, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0067024333238412765, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.21961956189715037, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Participation in Semi-finals: Both Iceland and Ireland have participated in Eurovision in recent years, so it's likely they will participate again in 2024. However, there's always a small chance they might not participate. 2. Qualification criteria: The EBU will select the top 10 countries from each Semi-final to qualify for the Grand Final. This means that both Iceland and Ireland will need to perform well in their respective Semi-finals to have a chance of qualifying. 3. Past performance: Iceland and Ireland have had varying levels of success in Eurovision over the years. Iceland has had some strong performances, while Ireland has had a few recent successes. However, past performance is not a guarantee of future success. Considering these factors, it's difficult to estimate a precise probability without more information about the competition. However, I'll provide a rough estimate based on my analysis. The probability that both Iceland and Ireland will participate in their respective Semi-finals is likely high, given their history of participation. Let's assume a probability of 0.9 (or 90%) for each country participating. The probability that both countries will qualify for the Grand Final is more difficult to estimate. Assuming they both participate, I'd estimate the probability of qualifying as follows: For Iceland, based on its past performance, I'd estimate a probability of 0.2 (or 20%) of qualifying for the Grand Final. For Ireland, based on its recent successes, I'd estimate a probability of 0.35 (or 35%) of qualifying for the Grand Final. Using these probabilities, we can estimate the probability that both countries will qualify for the Grand Final by multiplying the probabilities together: 0.9 (Iceland participating) * 0.9 (Ireland participating) * 0.2 (Iceland qualifying) * 0.35 (Ireland qualifying) \u2248 0.126 (or 12.6%). However, this is a relatively low estimate, and we might want to adjust it based on the specific details of the competition. To be conservative, let's round down the estimate to 0.1 (or 10%).

Firstly, the probability of Nikki Haley being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election is difficult to estimate with certainty.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment specifically states that any person who has engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or given aid or comfort to its enemies, shall be disqualified from holding any office, civil or military, under the United States. The key condition for this question is that Joe Biden has an in-person interview or conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024.

The fact that Joe Biden has been subject to such scrutiny and pressure already (he has made an announcement about running in the primaries), it seems highly probable that he would comply with a request or agreement for a 45+ minute interview, at some point, in this timeline, considering the frequency with which such events are reported on and the eagerness with which the press might arrange for such engagements in pursuit of new content for publication or broadcast before July ends.

Firstly, the condition that Trump leads Biden by more than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points on July 15, 2024, suggests that Trump is currently in a relatively strong position in the polls. However, this does not necessarily imply that he will remain the Republican nominee, as the nomination process involves various factors, including delegate selection, party politics, and potential challenges from other candidates. Secondly, Asa Hutchinson is an Arkansas-based politician who has not been a prominent figure in the 2024 presidential election. While he has expressed interest in running, it's unclear if he has the necessary support from Republican voters and delegates to secure the nomination. Considering these points, the probability of Asa Hutchinson being the Republican nominee given the specified polling condition is relatively low.

For condition (a), I'll consider the historical polling trends and the current state of the election. As of my knowledge cutoff, the 2024 presidential election is still in its early stages, and the polling numbers are subject to change. However, I can analyze the past polling trends to make an educated estimate. According to 538's national polling average, Trump's lead over Biden has fluctuated over time. Given the current state of the election, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether Trump's lead will be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024. However, I can estimate the probability based on the historical trends and the current polling numbers. For condition (b), I'll consider the current state of the Republican primary election and the likelihood of Asa Hutchinson being selected as the nominee. As of my knowledge cutoff, the Republican primary election is still ongoing, and several candidates are vying for the nomination. While Asa Hutchinson is a potential candidate, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether he will be selected as the nominee. However, I can estimate the probability based on the current polling numbers and the likelihood of Hutchinson being selected. To estimate the probability that both conditions will occur, I'll multiply the probabilities of each condition occurring. This is a simplification, as the two conditions are not independent, but it provides a rough estimate. For condition (a), I estimate the probability of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, to be around 20%. This is based on the historical polling trends and the current state of the election. For condition (b), I estimate the probability of Asa Hutchinson being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election to be around 5%. This is based on the current polling numbers and the likelihood of Hutchinson being selected.

The qualification of a country is typically based on jury voting and public voting outcomes in the Semi-finals, combined with an internal pre-voting qualification process carried out by the EBU. These processes may slightly favor established participating nations due to pre-existing structures for broadcasting, audience enthusiasm, and institutional support compared to new participants. Eurovision has over the years consistently featured participation from nearly all European countries, ensuring broad geographic diversity. Moreover, the format allows semi-finalists a chance, and there is a degree of unpredictability in each vote, given the significant number of jurors and votes, which suggests that either of these countries could receive sufficient votes. However, since both countries are relative newcomers to Eurovision relative to some more established players and their recent introduction may not immediately guarantee semi-final qualification or the internal support needed to bypass to the Grand Final, the question's 'either or' condition opens a door to both occurring simultaneously, although this involves higher probabilities as it reduces each individual event's certainty from 1 to allow room for their joint qualification as the basis of finalizing the yes condition which implies that a lower occurrence could be enough to affect its resolution probability. With that said, considering broad patterns of the competition\u2019s semi-final to Grand-Final qualification outcomes, country specific participation rates, likelihoods of individual performances positively contributing to such outcomes the possibility of the event itself could be perceived as substantial though the detailed probabilities rely heavily on those specifics above as well as any known past performance factors and possible political influences of participating in previous years for the overall nations participating that year at least. The final detailed reason is not possible and cannot be concluded with our data alone given the variable performance and subjective voting dynamics present in such a broadcast-based competition; hence leaving out a conclusion to either scenario and implying that resolution yes could potentially occur or does not and hence probabilities being more difficult to obtain through a solely logical deterministic system without having more contextual evidence or having to refer back to known historical competition performances and specific country details."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06468355635390688, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.021561185451302294, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3925679419426603, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Assuming Iceland's participation in a Semi-final is a given, the probability of them being officially announced as having qualified for the Grand Final by the EBU can be estimated based on their past performance.

Similar to Iceland, the probability of Georgia qualifying can be estimated based on their past performance. Let's assume a probability of 0.55 (55%) for Georgia qualifying. Since the question requires both countries to qualify, we need to consider the joint probability of both events occurring.
