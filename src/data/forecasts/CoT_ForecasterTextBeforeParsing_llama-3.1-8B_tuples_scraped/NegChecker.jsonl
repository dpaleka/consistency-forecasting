First, Elon Musk has been a well-known advocate for Bitcoin and has shown interest in the cryptocurrency in the past. This suggests that he might be interested in attending a conference like Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which could be a platform for him to share his views and engage with the community. However, there is no publicly available information that confirms his attendance, and the organizers of the event might not have made any official announcements about his participation. Additionally, considering the large number of attendees and speakers at such conferences, it's possible that even if Elon Musk is interested, his schedule might not allow him to attend. On the other hand, the organizers of the event might have tried to attract high-profile speakers like Elon Musk to increase the event's visibility and appeal. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Elon Musk showing up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 as follows: Elon Musk's interest in Bitcoin and his past behavior suggest a moderate likelihood of his attendance (40%). However, the lack of official confirmation and the uncertainty around his schedule reduce this likelihood (30%). The organizers' efforts to attract high-profile speakers add another 10% to the likelihood. Therefore, the overall probability is around 40% + 30% + 10% = 80%.

Considering these factors, it's challenging to assign a high probability to Croatia's qualification.

In fact, Croatia has participated in every Eurovision since 1993 and has a track record of qualifying for the Grand Final. The fact that the question asks for the probability of failure rather than success suggests that we should be cautious and not assume qualification. Additionally, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has strict rules and guidelines for participants, and it's likely that Croatia will follow them. However, without information on the specific rules, voting patterns, and artist performances, it's challenging to estimate the probability with high confidence. I'm also aware that there have been instances in the past where countries have been unable to qualify for the Grand Final, but these events are relatively rare.

Firstly, the combined peak for COVID, influenza, and RSV typically occurs in the winter months, with the exact timing varying from year to year. However, based on historical data, it is likely that the combined peak will occur sometime between December and February. Secondly, the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 for each of these viruses tends to occur shortly after the peak, often within 1-2 weeks. This is because the peak is typically a result of a rapid increase in cases, followed by a decline as the virus spreads and more people become immune.

However, the current record for the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie is held by the original Deadpool at $284.5M globally. To resolve the question in the affirmative, the movie would need to gross less than or equal to $284.5M globally this opening weekend, according to reports. Alternatively, the Hollywood Reporter (or equivalent publication) would need to not report it as the record for an R-rated movie release.

The Olympics typically feature around 200 countries, and each country has a unique combination of athletic abilities and resources. However, not all countries have the same level of competitive experience or success. Countries that have never won an Olympic medal before are more likely to win one in the 2024 Games, as they have not yet reached their peak or experienced the pressure of international competition. This suggests that the number of countries winning their first medal could be substantial. However, the number of countries winning their first medal is also influenced by the presence of strong teams and individual athletes from more experienced countries. These teams and athletes can dominate events and limit the number of first-time medal winners. Given these factors, we can expect a moderate to high number of countries to win their first Olympic medal at the 2024 Games.

Given the high level of competition, it's difficult to predict with certainty that Borussia Dortmund will not win the tournament. However, I can consider the following factors: Borussia Dortmund's current form and performance in the group stage and knockout rounds, the strength and form of other teams in the tournament, particularly those that have historically performed well in the Champions League, and the format of the tournament, which includes a group stage and knockout rounds, and the potential for upsets in each round. Taking these factors into account, I would estimate that Borussia Dortmund's chances of not winning the tournament are relatively high, but not extremely high. This is because they are a strong team, and while they may face challenges in the tournament, they also have the potential to advance and potentially win the title. However, considering the high level of competition and the unpredictability of the tournament, I would not assign a very high probability to Borussia Dortmund not winning the tournament."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.17089956220541458, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.08544978110270729, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5710402407201607, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Geomagnetic storms are caused by solar wind and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) interacting with the Earth's magnetic field. The intensity of the storm depends on the speed, density, and direction of the solar wind, as well as the orientation of the Earth's magnetic field.

Geomagnetic storms are more frequent and intense around the equinoxes (March and September) and during solar maximum, but the time period in question falls around solar minimum, suggesting a lower likelihood of intense storms. However, geomagnetic storms can still occur due to other factors such as coronal mass ejections not directly related to solar maximum.

However, there can be cases where a break is not explicitly stated, but still occurs due to various reasons such as production delays or editorial decisions. Given the information provided, the question aims to determine if there will be a break after chapter 40, which implies that the resolution is focused on the timing of the next chapter's release rather than the chapter's content itself. Without explicit information about the publication schedule or any leaks regarding a break, I must rely on general knowledge about the manga's release patterns. Considering that Shonen Jump typically releases new chapters every week, and the question does not provide any specific context or leaks suggesting a break, I would lean towards the likelihood of a break being relatively low.

Days with a Kp index greater than 4 are less common, occurring on around 10-20% of days in July.\n\nHowever, during intense space weather events, the Kp index can rise above 5, often as a result of high-speed solar wind or coronal mass ejections (CMEs) interacting with the Earth's magnetic field.

Firstly, the success of a movie is often dependent on its marketing, production quality, and the audience's reception. Since 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is a sequel to two successful movies, it's likely to have a built-in audience and a strong marketing campaign. However, the quality of the movie itself, the chemistry between the leads, and the direction of the film will also play a crucial role in determining its box office performance. Secondly, the box office performance of a movie can be influenced by external factors such as the time of release, competition from other movies, and the overall state of the economy. In this case, the release date of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is not specified, but it's likely to be released in a crowded summer movie season, which could impact its box office performance. Lastly, we can look at the box office performance of the original 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' movies. Both movies were successful, but 'Deadpool' performed significantly better, grossing over $782 million worldwide compared to 'The Wolverine''s $414 million.

Firstly, the opening weekend box office performance of a movie is influenced by several factors such as marketing, audience interest, release timing, and competition. The success of the original 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'The Wolverine' (2013) was significant, with the first one grossing $132.43 million and the latter grossing $53.11 million. The combined total is $185.54 million. The new movie, 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' is a crossover film that brings together two popular characters from the X-Men franchise. This could attract a large audience, potentially leading to a higher box office opening. However, the movie's marketing campaign, the overall quality of the film, and the current market conditions will also play a significant role in determining its opening weekend performance. Considering these factors, it's difficult to make a precise prediction without access to more specific data or information about the movie's marketing campaign, production quality, and audience reception.

Firstly, Joe Biden is the incumbent President of the United States and has a strong support base within his party. He has also shown resilience in the face of challenges in the past, including during his 2020 presidential campaign. However, the current market is likely influenced by various factors such as the ongoing Democratic primary elections, Biden's age and health, and potential challenges from other Democratic candidates. Given that the market will resolve on July 20, we are only considering the time frame up to that point. While there have been some recent polls and controversies surrounding Biden's candidacy, there is no clear indication that he will drop out before July 20. In fact, Biden has consistently maintained a strong position in the polls, and his campaign has shown no signs of faltering. However, it's also worth noting that the Democratic primary is inherently unpredictable, and unexpected events can occur that could impact Biden's candidacy.

On the other hand, not testifying could be a strategic decision to avoid potentially incriminating himself or to maintain a defensive stance.

As of my last update in 2022, Linda Yaccarino had been announced as the next CEO of NBCUniversal but had not officially taken on the role or been appointed to a CEO position at Twitter. My reasoning focuses on the announcement timeline, the specific details of Linda Yaccarino's career, and the competitive landscape of top executive roles in the technology and media sectors. While these are speculative considerations and not exhaustive, they do suggest some uncertainty around whether Linda Yaccarino would indeed be appointed Twitter's CEO by July 1, 2024. However, the crucial point in this reasoning process is that there's an inherent possibility of an unforeseen turn of events - such as a sudden and unexpected decision by Twitter's board, a dramatic change in global or industry events, or a significant move by competitors that could either accelerate or hinder Linda Yaccarino's chances of being appointed CEO at Twitter.

However, there are many other countries with a strong gaming culture and a large player base that are not listed in the question. To estimate the probability of a country other than the listed ones winning, we need to consider the number of teams that will participate in the championship and the likelihood of each team winning. Assuming that there are around 20-30 teams participating in the championship (a rough estimate, as the actual number is not provided), and that the teams from the listed countries have a strong chance of competing at a high level, the probability of a country other than the listed ones winning would be relatively low. However, it's also possible that teams from other countries have been working hard to improve their skills and have a good chance of winning. Additionally, the Warhammer 40,000 community is known for its diversity and inclusivity, and it's possible that teams from smaller or less well-known countries could surprise everyone and win the championship. Taking all these factors into account, I would estimate the probability of a country other than Poland, Germany, USA, Sweden, England, or France winning the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship to be around 0.2, or 20%. This is a relatively low probability, as the listed teams have a strong presence in the Warhammer 40,000 community and a good chance of competing at a high level. However, it's not impossible that a team from another country could win, and it's always exciting to see underdog teams succeed."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "e7016cb1-5854-40bd-872c-c33f712bb367", "title": "Will Poland, Germany, USA, Sweden, England, or France win the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship?", "body": "This question will resolve Yes if Poland, Germany, USA, Sweden, England, or France is the winner of the WTC 2024 as announced on the official site or the official social media of the organisation.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-12T00:12:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-25T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.167, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "This question is about the outcome of a specific event, the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship, which has not yet occurred.

However, specific plans such as introducing a new parade might be more tied to marketing strategies, operational timelines, and consumer interest surveys, which are less readily accessible. One clue within the resolution is the definition of NO: 'unless it is announced prior to the convention, in which case it will close as soon as I can after the announcement.' This condition hints that if there are strong reasons for the conclusion of the resolution, any update might trigger immediate changes to the status. Also, it is not too long before the event the announcement will happen at that, usually, big resorts have already finalized all its key offerings a long before D23 convention starts because planning this stuff take significant amount of time and would also allow to start producing, training the team who is working at night of this new show which helps for smoother operations on time when this event goes 'live'. Given this dynamic it would make the update that likely going to close it, but given those time frame I estimate some time has already gone after a key date the planner use for that which leaves just little window. Moreover, since D23's are often key moment at which resorts release all significant changes in resorts offerings then also increase of marketing the said change at said timeframe gives an evidence the release was not random event so given these fact gives reason to estimate some facts on it. However that might also not being something resort might decide do later which will have the little probability because all major release like that already made sometime in the summer to allows production, planning to meet summer crowds. Taking also that given it already on going it was some possible decision taken sometime back from current moment when resort are getting close to announce in next major marketing moment or might just been released today before announcement then still was also good indication.

Firstly, I will look at recent announcements and trends in new parades and attractions. Since the Magic Kingdom already has a night-time show, Happily Ever After, and has experienced closures due to COVID, a new parade could provide additional revenue and draw tourists in. However, Walt Disney World has had trouble scheduling new nighttime entertainment experiences that can compete with popular festivals like the EPCOT International Food & Wine Festival. Moreover, while the Main Street Electrical Parade has been successful when presented at Disneyland in Anaheim, its return to Disneyland for a limited time (which has been very profitable for Disney) does indicate an interest in presenting old Disney experiences in a re-vamped way, the move of Paint the Night would require significant logistics change at Magic Kingdom. A parade could be seen as something new and potentially expensive and complex to create given how many people would see the parade. There would likely be a high chance for a parade to take 1-2+ years to plan. But at the same time given all the other attractions going in, it might have potential for a high return. Given the time it would take to plan, Disney could potentially announce it in a year or two which is after the D23 event.

However, I also need to consider the possibility that they might reiterate their existing stance rather than making a new commitment. 2. The righttowarn.ai statement and its significance: The righttowarn.ai statement is a key reference point for this question. If OpenAI makes a statement that indicates a new level of commitment to the principle, it would suggest that they are taking the issue seriously. However, if they simply reiterate their existing stance, it would not be sufficient to resolve the question as Yes. 3. The verification process by Metaculus: Metaculus's verification process adds an additional layer of complexity to the question. If Metaculus is unable to verify that OpenAI has accepted the principle to the satisfaction of at least one member of righttowarn.ai, it would suggest that OpenAI has not made a sufficient commitment. 4.

However, there have been instances where the publication of results has been delayed due to various reasons such as technical issues, disputes, or political pressure. 2. Current political climate: The current political climate in Venezuela is highly polarized, and there may be potential for disputes or challenges to the election results. This could potentially lead to delays in the publication of full results. 3. The question specifies that the results must be published before August 12, 2024, at 12:01 AM Venezuelan Standard Time (VET).

The EBU typically announces the qualified countries for the Grand Final after the Semi-finals have taken place. If San Marino fails to qualify, it will be announced by the EBU. However, we do not have any information about San Marino's performance in the Semi-finals or its chances of qualifying for the Grand Final. Assuming that San Marino has a typical performance, the probability of them failing to qualify for the Grand Final is around 50%. Given that these two events are mutually exclusive, we can combine their probabilities to get the overall probability of San Marino failing to qualify for the Grand Final. However, since the first event (not participating in a Semi-final) is very unlikely, we can ignore it and focus on the second event (failing to qualify for the Grand Final)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.15423402496870198, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.07711701248435099, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5688989110008146, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The key factors to consider are the current political climate, the motivations of the Vice President and the Cabinet members, and the potential consequences of invoking the 25th Amendment. Firstly, the current political climate is highly polarized, and any move to invoke the 25th Amendment would be a highly contentious and potentially divisive action. The Vice President and Cabinet members may be hesitant to take such a step, especially given the potential backlash from the public, the Democratic Party, and other stakeholders. Secondly, the motivations of the Vice President and Cabinet members will play a crucial role in determining the likelihood of invocation. If they are motivated by a genuine concern for the President's ability to perform his duties, they may be more likely to invoke the 25th Amendment. However, if their motivations are driven by political considerations, such as a desire to remove Biden from office or to gain power, they may be less likely to take such a step. Thirdly, the potential consequences of invoking the 25th Amendment should also be considered. A successful invocation would likely lead to significant political upheaval, potentially destabilizing the government and the Democratic Party. This could have far-reaching consequences, including changes in the balance of power in Congress and the potential for a new presidential election. Considering these factors, I would estimate that the probability of the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment before August 2024 is relatively low.

Secondly, the number of world records broken can also be influenced by the specific events and the competition format.

Thirdly, we should consider the trend of world records in previous Olympics. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing record-breaking, with many athletes pushing the boundaries of human performance. However, there are also factors that could lead to fewer records being broken. For example, if there are changes in the rules or regulations of certain events, it could make it harder for athletes to break records.

Firstly, the relationship between Israel and Iran has been tense for decades, with both countries engaging in a prolonged conflict over issues such as nuclear development and regional influence. Given this history, it's plausible that Israel might attempt to disrupt Iran's nuclear program or retaliate against Iranian aggression. However, Israel has generally avoided direct military action against Iran in recent years, opting for covert operations and cyberattacks instead. This suggests that Israel may be cautious about escalating tensions with Iran, at least for now. That being said, there have been some recent developments that could increase the likelihood of an Israeli attack on Iran. For example, the recent tensions between the US and Iran over the latter's nuclear program may have led Israel to reassess its own options for countering Iranian nuclear ambitions. Additionally, Israel has been expanding its military capabilities and has been conducting exercises and drills that could be related to a potential attack on Iran. However, these developments are not necessarily indicative of an imminent attack, and it's possible that they are part of a broader strategy to deter or prepare for a potential Iranian attack. Considering these factors, I would assign a moderate probability to the event of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024.

Historically, China and Taiwan have had a complex relationship, with China viewing Taiwan as a part of its territory and Taiwan considering itself a sovereign state. In recent years, tensions have escalated, particularly under the presidency of Tsai Ing-wen, who has been seen as a strong advocate for Taiwan's independence. However, despite these tensions, there have been no major armed conflicts between China and Taiwan in recent years. In fact, the last major incident occurred in 1996, when China conducted a series of missile tests near Taiwan in response to Taiwan's first direct presidential election. More recently, China has been increasing its military presence around Taiwan, including sending warships and fighter jets through the Taiwan Strait. However, these actions have been largely seen as a show of force rather than an indication of an imminent attack. Given this context, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether there will be an armed conflict between China and Taiwan in 2024. However, based on recent developments, it seems unlikely that there will be a major conflict in the near future. One potential factor that could increase the likelihood of conflict is the upcoming Taiwanese presidential election, which is scheduled to take place in January 2024. If the election were to result in a president who is seen as more pro-independence, it could potentially increase tensions with China. However, even in this scenario, it is unlikely that China would launch a major attack on Taiwan before June 6th, as this would likely be seen as a provocative move that could lead to international condemnation.

Furthermore, pole vaulting is a highly competitive and unpredictable sport, with athletes frequently pushing the limits of what is thought possible.

Since we don't have access to Nate Silver's model or the actual probability values at that time, we can't directly calculate the probability.

Historically, the Core CPI has shown an upward trend over the past 5 years, with some minor fluctuations. The 12-month percentage change has been consistently above 2% since 2021. The 3-month percentage change has also shown an upward trend, albeit with some volatility. However, the 1-month percentage change has been more volatile, but still generally positive. Looking at the current economic indicators, the unemployment rate is low, and the labor market is strong, which tends to support inflation. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has been tightening monetary policy, which could lead to higher interest rates and, consequently, higher borrowing costs, potentially fueling inflation. However, the impact of these factors is uncertain and subject to change. Given these considerations, while there is a possibility of a small increase in the Core CPI, I lean towards a moderate increase, but not exceeding 0.1% due to the current economic conditions and the historical trend. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the Month-over-Month US Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July as follows."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "476df6fc-fbc9-477e-8062-c9025d1ea7f3", "title": "Will the Month-over-Month US Core CPI increase by 0.1% or less in July?", "body": "Resolves YES if the seasonally adjusted Core CPI for July 2024 increases by 0.1% or less compared to June 2024.\n\nThe Data for resolution will be https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPILFESL and will use the exact (not rounded) value.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-14T13:07:28Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-08-09T19:42:33Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.35, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability of the Month-over-Month US Core CPI increasing by 0.1% or less in July, we need to consider the historical trends and seasonality of the Core CPI data.

First, we note that the resolution source (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/biden-drop-out-democrats.html) is an interactive page that tracks the call for Biden to drop out by Democratic Senators. At the time of my analysis, the page does not provide a real-time snapshot of the current number of Senators calling for Biden's drop out. However, we can make an educated guess based on historical and current events. Since it's difficult to estimate the exact number of Democratic Senators who might call for Biden to drop out, let's consider the potential number of Senators who might potentially call for his drop out. According to historical context, it's been more than a decade since Vice President Biden was a high-profile politician, and any call for him to drop out might be largely speculative or related to more partisan issues. Given this uncertainty, I'll focus on a few potential indicators and use a combination of the following: (1) The relatively low probability (20%) of 3 or more Senators calling for Biden to drop out after a significant drop in trust and the high stakes related to the election (3 Senators called for his dropping out after a speech but not enough to pass), (2) a strong negative sentiment against President Trump among Democratic voters which creates an uncertain scenario in potential primary scenarios and potential cross-over appeal among the parties (in some primary cycles), and (3) a potential moderate split vote within the Democratic Party to choose the primary winner; and given these points will make a relatively weakly informed estimate. Considering a split in the vote at the primaries, we get a rough estimate for '10 or more Senators willing to call for his withdraw' being about 27% in the range; and that this probability also accounts for a strong polarization within the Democratic party."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "5f99a1ff-c470-42bf-b8bd-f20a8c27ca04", "title": "Will fewer than 10 Democratic Senators call for Biden to drop out before July 20?", "body": "Resolution source: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/biden-drop-out-democrats.html\n\nIf at no point before midnight July 20 Central Time, it shows 10 or more Dem Senators, this market will resolve to yes.

The time frame before July 20 is relatively short, which implies that the number of Senators calling for Biden to drop out may increase as the deadline approaches. 3. However, the current political climate and the upcoming elections may also influence Senators' decisions, potentially causing some to hold back or delay their calls for Biden to drop out. 4. Without real-time updates or current polling data on Senators' intentions, I rely on general knowledge that politicians often consider their opinions and actions carefully, balancing their own interests with potential consequences for their party. Considering these factors, while it's uncertain how the situation will unfold, there's a plausible scenario in which fewer than 10 Democratic Senators might call for Biden to drop out.

However, the US has also been investing heavily in Olympic sports programs, which may give them an advantage in other sports like basketball, soccer, and volleyball. It's also worth noting that the Paris 2024 Olympics will feature a new format, with a greater emphasis on gender equality and more opportunities for teams to compete in new sports.

He has consistently shown his ability to score goals at an elite level, and his transfer to Manchester City in 2022 has given him access to a top-class team with a strong squad and a high-powered attack. However, the Premier League is a highly competitive league with many talented goal-scorers, and several teams have strong attacking lineups. For Haaland to score the most goals, he will need to maintain his goal-scoring form throughout the season, and also outperform other top strikers such as Harry Kane, Mohamed Salah, and Son Heung-Min. Additionally, the Premier League season is long and grueling, with 38 games per team, which can lead to injuries and dips in form. While Haaland has shown his durability and ability to play at a high level consistently, there is always a risk of injury or fatigue affecting his performance. Considering these factors, I believe that while Erling Haaland is a strong contender to score the most goals in the 2023/24 Premier League season, the competition is fierce, and there are several other talented goal-scorers who could potentially challenge him.

Albania has had some successful years, but they have also had some years where they did not qualify for the Grand Final. However, in recent years, they have shown improvement in their performances. Given this information, we can assume that Albania has a reasonable chance of qualifying for the Grand Final, but it's not a certainty.

Firstly, I note that the question is asking about the control of a specific location, Chasiv Yar, which is a town in eastern Ukraine. The conflict in Ukraine has been ongoing for several years, with Russia having control over parts of the country, including the Donbas region, where Chasiv Yar is located. However, the situation on the ground has been dynamic, with Ukrainian forces making gains in certain areas and Russian forces pushing back in others. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map, which is used to determine the resolution of this question, is a reliable source of information on the conflict, and its categories for assessing control are well-defined. Given the current situation, I believe that the probability of Russia not having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, is relatively low. This is because Russia has a significant military presence in the Donbas region, and it is likely that they will continue to maintain control over Chasiv Yar in the short term. However, I also consider the possibility of Ukrainian forces making gains in the area, which could potentially lead to a change in control. The ISW map categories for assessing Ukrainian control, such as 'Reported Ukrainian Territorial Gains in the Past 24 Hours' and 'Claimed Ukrainian Counteroffensives,' suggest that there is a possibility of Ukrainian forces making progress in the area.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge the historical dominance of Kenyans, primarily of Kalenjin origin, in long-distance events, particularly marathons. Kenya has consistently produced world-class marathon runners who have taken home numerous gold medals, including at the Olympic Games. However, the ability of Kalenjin athletes to win both the men's and women's events at the 2024 Paris Olympics requires considering more recent trends, including recent performances and updates on contenders. While past performance does not guarantee future success, the historical record of the Kalenjin people being a significant contributor to successful marathon runners cannot be disregarded. At the same time, acknowledging the international field and competitors from various countries, there's potential for athletes not of Kalenjin descent to push for top positions. But given the recent success and the fact that the top athletes often peak around major competitions, a strong pool of Kalenjin competitors is likely. However, the Olympics involve a huge pool of global talent and the ability to win such a prestigious race is as much about competition as form. Therefore, while I believe there will be both men's and women's Kalenjin athletes strong contenders, other factors include the performance at the pre-Olympics competitions. The recent injury history or form of these athletes needs to be evaluated. But, given their historical strong performance, strong training camp, and experience, combined with the unpredictable nature of major competitions like the Olympics, I anticipate a fairly high chance that at least one of these races may be won by a Kalenjin athlete. Considering these factors and the difficulty of predicting future outcomes of high-level international competitions without access to more current detailed information, a reasonable assessment leans towards it being highly likely that one of these races may be won by a Kalenjin athlete, but the outcome of each race is harder to estimate. Despite the historical data suggesting there will be Kalenjin athletes in strong contention in both races, the Olympic competition is global, competitive, and very unpredictable on a race by race level. However, the pattern of success historically and, more importantly, the probability of at least one event being won by a Kalenjin, makes this a reasonable bet. I conclude that it is relatively likely that one of these races will be won by a Kalenjin, but the outcome of each race is harder to estimate. Given that the Olympic marathon is just one competition, and performance can greatly vary from competition to competition, I still lean slightly towards the affirmative outcome on the basis that there would be a chance for such an outcome considering the competitiveness of the global field of athletes. But, putting all these complexities aside and focusing on the specific chance of both the men\u2019s and women's races at the 2024 Olympics being won by Kalenjin athletes without access to the current forms and without the ability to predict Olympic performances accurately based on just historical data alone, suggests that the prediction should remain cautious. Thus, without current information or a precise method to account for variables such as global competition field, the detailed reasoning remains that there would be high chances of success for some Kalenjin athletes due to their historic dominance of the marathon discipline, their strong training regimen, global competition experience and their likelihood of being highly competitive due to their origins. Based on this information, though, the overall probability slightly leans towards this being true, given historical trends that suggest that, at a minimum, Kalenjin athletes have consistently been and will likely be strong competitors in the marathons at the 2024 Olympics. But, there is a level of variability in predicting exact outcomes with such a method, therefore, I do not strongly lean towards yes or strongly lean towards a high certainty of this prediction. And, therefore, I place the probability in the reasonable range that one of these races will indeed be won by a Kalenjin athlete, making the most likely outcome not to meet the specific requirements of winning both races a slightly better chance than an affirmative for both races without more updated information. Hence, the probability would be slightly on the higher end of a reasonable estimate."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "bc1f69ec-0c29-4228-8591-debd6a25fb70", "title": "Will Kalenjin athletes fail to win at least one of the men's or women's marathon races at the 2024 Paris Olympics?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if either the winner of the men's marathon or the winner of the women's marathon at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris does not have Kalenjin roots.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-11T11:12:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-15T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.7, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability that Kalenjin athletes will fail to win at least one of the men's or women's marathon races at the 2024 Paris Olympics, we need to consider the historical performance of Kalenjin athletes in long-distance running events, particularly in the marathon.

Historically, Kalenjin athletes have dominated long-distance events at the Olympic Games, and it's likely that they will continue to be competitive in the marathon events at the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, it's also possible that other athletes from different backgrounds may have been training and preparing specifically for the Olympics, and may have a good chance of winning.

While I don't have access to real-time data, I can infer that drivers who have historically performed well at the circuit are more likely to outscore their opponents. Secondly, I will consider the current form of both drivers. If one driver has been consistently performing well in recent races, they may be more likely to outscore their opponent.

This means that the outcome is not solely dependent on the main race, but also on the performance of both drivers in the sprint race.

Firstly, I look at the performances of both drivers in similar conditions and their past races. Yuki Tsunoda has shown potential and occasional flashes of brilliance in his Formula 1 career, but he often falls short of consistent high performances. Daniel Ricciardo, on the other hand, is a more experienced driver with a strong background in Formula 1, having competed at a high level for many years. He has a reputation for being able to adapt to different cars and conditions, which can give him an edge in unpredictable races like the Belgian Grand Prix. Secondly, I consider the specific characteristics of the Belgian Grand Prix circuit. The circuit is known for its challenging weather conditions, with high winds and unpredictable rain showers. This can make it difficult for drivers to maintain a consistent pace and make strategic decisions about when to push hard and when to play it safe. Given Yuki Tsunoda's tendency to struggle with consistency, I believe he may find it harder to adapt to these conditions than Daniel Ricciardo. Finally, I look at the general trends in the Formula 1 season so far. While there have been some surprises and upsets, the top drivers have generally been able to maintain their positions at the front of the grid. Given this, I believe that Daniel Ricciardo's experience and consistency will give him an advantage over Yuki Tsunoda at the Belgian Grand Prix."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.012003969168639106, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.006001984584319553, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15504341823651052, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The outcome of the convention will depend on a variety of factors, including the candidates' campaign strategies, fundraising abilities, and the support they receive from party delegates.

Both Drake and Kendrick Lamar are prominent figures in the hip-hop world, and diss tracks are a common way for artists to respond to perceived slights or to gain attention. However, diss tracks are often released in response to a provocation or a perceived slight, which is a subjective and unpredictable trigger. In the past, both artists have released diss tracks in response to perceived slights or to address controversies. For example, Drake released 'Take Care' in response to Pusha T's diss track 'The Story of Adidon,' and Kendrick Lamar released 'King Kunta' in response to a perceived diss from Drake. However, they have also released diss tracks without a clear provocation, such as Drake's 'The Rake' and Kendrick Lamar's 'The Heart Part 4.'

The Olympics typically feature around 200 countries, and each country has a unique set of athletes and sports. However, the likelihood of a country winning its first gold medal depends on various factors such as the country's athletic talent, the sports they participate in, and the competition level. Given that there are 200 countries participating, and assuming that each country has an equal chance of winning its first gold medal, we can estimate the probability of a country winning its first gold medal as 1/200. However, this is a simplification, as some countries are more likely to win due to their athletic talent, sports participation, and competition level. To estimate the probability that fewer than 5 countries will win their debut gold medal, we need to consider the cumulative probability of 5 or more countries winning their first gold medal. This can be calculated using the binomial distribution, which models the probability of k successes in n independent trials, where the probability of success in each trial is p. Using the binomial distribution, we can estimate the probability that 5 or more countries will win their debut gold medal as follows: P(X \u2265 5) = 1 - P(X < 5) = 1 - \u2211[P(X = k)] from k=0 to 4, where P(X = k) is the probability of k countries winning their debut gold medal, calculated using the binomial distribution.

However, Portugal has often been able to secure a spot in the Grand Final, even in years when they haven't been among the favorites. 4. The European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) selection process: The EBU selects the participants for the Eurovision contest, and they have a process in place to ensure that all participating countries meet certain criteria.

Portugal's qualification chances depend on their performance in the semi-final. However, the question does not provide any information about Portugal's performance or the competition.
