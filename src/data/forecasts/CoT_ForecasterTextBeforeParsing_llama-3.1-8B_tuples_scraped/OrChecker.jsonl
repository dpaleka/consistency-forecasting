Youngkin is a former Governor of Virginia and has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, the Republican primary field is likely to be crowded, and the nomination process is highly competitive. The Republican National Convention typically selects the nominee through a combination of primary elections, caucuses, and delegate allocation.

Glenn Youngkin, the current Governor of Virginia, has gained attention and popularity within the Republican Party, particularly after his 2021 gubernatorial election victory. Larry Elder, a conservative talk radio host, has also been mentioned as a potential candidate, leveraging his strong conservative credentials and media presence. 2. Primary Election Process: The Republican National Convention is where the party's nominee is officially selected.

The outcome of these early contests can significantly influence the delegate count and, consequently, the nomination process. 3. Potential Candidates: The question is not limited to the current list of candidates, which means other individuals may enter the race. This opens the field to a variety of possibilities, increasing the potential for either Youngkin or Elder to secure the nomination. 4. Historical Context: The Republican Party has a history of nominating candidates who are not necessarily the front-runners in the polls or the most well-known figures. The nomination process often involves a mix of grassroots support, party establishment backing, and the ability to appeal to a broad range of voters. 5. Electorate Sentiment and Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has undergone significant shifts in recent years, with growing divisions between the party's moderate and conservative wings.

However, without having direct access to the model's data or the ability to browse the link, I can only rely on general knowledge about Nate Silver's model and its behavior. Nate Silver's model is known for its accuracy and frequent updates, and the model's predictions are often influenced by various factors such as polling data, economic indicators, and other variables. Given that Nate Silver's model is likely to be updated regularly and that the resolution date is the day after the model's update time, it is plausible that the model could reflect changes in the polling data or other factors that might affect Harris's chances. However, without specific information about the current state of the model, it's challenging to make an informed prediction. Considering these factors, I would estimate that there is a moderate chance of the odds increasing, as it's possible that the model could reflect changes in the polling data or other factors that might improve Harris's chances.

Event (a) is relatively unlikely because Joe Biden has not shown any signs of not seeking re-nomination, and it would be a significant departure from his previous statements and actions.

Firstly, we should consider the latest political developments and news reporting around the potential scenarios: 1. Government designation of Kamala Harris as President or Acting President: This would require sudden changes in the administration given President Biden's announced goals of running for re-election. The US government structure implies that there are built-in checks and balances between branches, which might help in preventing any hasty designations. 2. Biden dropping out of the race: This might be influenced by various internal and external factors, such as health issues, mounting public pressure, or disagreements within the party. Yet, given the strongholds of the Democratic Party in the US and the leadership of President Biden, especially considering his announced intentions for re-election, this would be a significant development within the party. 3. Timing and probability calculation: The question resolves 'Yes' if either scenario occurs before specific dates, which are relatively close by. The probability of Kamala Harris being designated President or Acting President before July 26 is low. However, the probability that President Biden drops out of the race before July 20 is higher, particularly considering the potential for future political developments and the strong possibility of internal party issues arising. Considering these aspects, the probability that by July 26, whether it be through official redesignation or Biden dropping, Kamala Harris becomes engaged as President or Acting for President is very low until then."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0036260224103061844, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0012086741367687281, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07179581586177382, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

While Nikki Haley is a prominent politician and has expressed interest in the presidency, there is no indication in the given information that she has any unique advantage in the election or has received any sort of special consideration from the party. To determine her likelihood of becoming the Republican nominee, it is worth noting that past nominees typically possess strong public recognition and strong fundraising capabilities. Furthermore, candidates are usually subject to scrutiny by the primary electorate before securing the party nomination. Based on her relative obscurity and moderate background in party politics (at least until 2018 when she left Trump administration) she faces several major competitors such as likely Republican primary opponents such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump in case he chooses to participate again. Her recent visit to Taiwan which drew diplomatic outrage from Beijing and further eroded a diplomatic aspect might raise potential drawbacks such as foreign relations for President candidates and this will lead in decreasing potential success from current market expectation for an outside the major contender Nikki Haley's probability for potential primary or General Election winner based solely from a well structured analytical thinking for Republican base, that in an expected conservative based US Population to take consideration to pick most known faces such has President Donald Trump.

Firstly, the selection of the nominee is determined by the delegates of the Republican National Convention, not the general public vote. This means that the outcome is largely dependent on the internal dynamics of the Republican Party and the preferences of its delegates. Donald Trump Jr. is a member of the Trump family, which has a significant following within the Republican Party, particularly among its conservative and populist factions. However, the party's nomination process has become increasingly unpredictable in recent years, with various factors such as factional infighting, external pressures, and shifting voter sentiments potentially influencing the outcome. Given the current political landscape and the unpredictable nature of the nomination process, I would argue that the probability of Donald Trump Jr. being selected as the Republican nominee is relatively low. While he has a strong family name and a loyal following, he lacks the broad-based support and experience that his father, Donald Trump, had when he was nominated in 2016. Additionally, the Republican Party has undergone significant changes since then, and the current crop of potential candidates is more diverse and competitive. However, it's also worth noting that the Republican National Convention is still far away, and many factors can influence the outcome between now and then. External events, such as shifting public opinion, scandals, or unexpected candidate withdrawals, can significantly impact the nomination process.

For instance, at the 2012 London Olympics, the USA won 46 Gold and 29 Silver medals, whereas at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the USA won 36 Gold and 38 Silver medals. Given the unpredictability of Olympic outcomes and the potential for fluctuations in performance, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction.

Firstly, the USA has a strong track record in the Olympics, consistently ranking among the top nations in terms of medal count. However, the competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics will be fierce, with many other top-performing nations such as China, Great Britain, and Russia (assuming they are allowed to participate) likely to be strong contenders. One factor that could work in the USA's favor is the home advantage, as the Olympics will be held in Paris, which may give the USA an edge in terms of crowd support and familiarity with the competition venue. Additionally, the USA has a well-established and well-funded Olympic program, which provides a strong foundation for its athletes to compete at the highest level. However, there are also several factors that could work against the USA. For example, other nations may have a stronger team in certain sports, which could give them an advantage in the overall medal count. Furthermore, the USA has faced challenges in recent years in terms of funding and support for its Olympic athletes, which could impact its performance at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

If he decides to run, his chances of being nominated are significant, given his previous success in the Republican primaries. Donald Trump Jr., on the other hand, has not expressed any interest in running for the presidency. While he is a prominent figure in the Trump family and has a significant following, his chances of being nominated are lower compared to his father. Considering these factors, I believe that the probability of either Donald Trump Jr. or Donald Trump being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election is relatively low, but not impossible.

Additionally, while some Democratic Senators have expressed concerns about Biden's candidacy, it's uncertain whether they will publicly call for him to drop out. Given the current political landscape, I would expect some level of dissatisfaction among Democrats, but it's unlikely that a significant number would publicly oppose the nomination or call for Biden to drop out. The nomination process typically unfolds in a relatively predictable manner, and significant opposition from within the party would be a rare occurrence. However, there is a possibility that some Democrats might feel compelled to speak out against the plan due to concerns about the nomination process or Biden's leadership.

The company has shown a willingness to comply with regional regulations, such as GDPR in the EU. The requirement for at least 50% of the population to be able to use it suggests that OpenAI is likely to make the service accessible to a significant portion of the EU population.

For the second event, the linked market having at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, I consider the following factors: The market's growth rate and historical data on trader activity. The market's popularity and user engagement. The time frame available for the market to grow to the required number of traders.

However, it's difficult to predict how many Senators would feel strongly enough about this issue to publicly call for Biden's withdrawal. Another factor to consider is the time frame given - before July 20.

Firstly, we consider the probability of Joe Biden's death before Saturday. Since the resolution date is July 26th, we are looking at a relatively short time frame. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at historical data on presidential mortality. According to various sources, the average lifespan of a U.S. president is around 78-80 years, and Joe Biden was born on November 20, 1942, which would make him approximately 81 years old. Based on this, we can estimate a low to moderate probability of his death before Saturday. Next, we consider the probability of a woman being nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate for the 2024 election. In the 2020 election, several women were considered as potential candidates, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Tulsi Gabbard. However, Joe Biden ultimately secured the nomination. Given the current pool of potential candidates and the fact that the 2024 election is still over a year away, it's difficult to estimate the exact probability.

Firstly, let's consider the control of Chasiv Yar. Chasiv Yar is a small town in eastern Ukraine, and the control of the area is subject to change due to ongoing military conflicts. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides a map that categorizes the control of various locations in Ukraine, including Chasiv Yar. However, it's challenging to predict with certainty whether Russia will control Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024, as the situation on the ground is dynamic and influenced by various factors, including military operations, political decisions, and other external factors. Regarding Joe Biden's announcement, it's also uncertain whether he will make a definitive statement about not accepting the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024.

First, let's consider (a) Biden dropping out before July 20. Given that Biden is the incumbent president and has not shown any signs of dropping out, this event seems highly unlikely. While anything can happen in politics, the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20 is low. Next, let's consider (b) Will Hurd becoming the Republican nominee. Will Hurd is a former US Representative from Texas who has expressed interest in running for president, but he has not gained significant traction in the polls. The Republican nomination process involves a series of primaries and caucuses, and it's difficult to predict who will emerge as the nominee. However, given the current field of candidates, it's unlikely that Will Hurd will be the nominee. Combining these two events, we need to consider the probability that at least one of them occurs. This can be done using the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). However, since the events are not mutually exclusive (i.e., they can both occur at the same time), we need to use the correct formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). In this case, since the events are quite unlikely, we can assume that P(A and B) is close to 0. Therefore, the formula simplifies to P(A or B) \u2248 P(A) + P(B). Using this approach, we can assign a probability to each event: P(Biden drops out before July 20) \u2248 0.05 (5%) and P(Will Hurd becomes the Republican nominee) \u2248 0.01 (1%).

First, let's consider the probability of Vivek Ramaswamy being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. While there are many candidates running, the Republican National Convention's selection process is inherently unpredictable, and it's challenging to assign a precise probability to any one candidate being chosen. However, historically, the convention has usually selected the candidate who performed well in the primaries or caucuses. Based on current polling and general trends, I would assign a probability of around 0.2 (or 20%) to Ramaswamy being selected as the nominee. Next, let's consider the probability of Rishi Sunak failing to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election. Typically, incumbent Prime Ministers, like Sunak, tend to perform well in their constituencies. However, there are many factors at play, including the voting behavior of the constituency, the strength of the opposing party, and any external events that might affect voter sentiment. Without specific data or polls for Sunak's constituency, it's difficult to assign a precise probability. However, as a general rule, it's relatively rare for a sitting Prime Minister to fail to be re-elected in their constituency. Based on this, I would assign a probability of around 0.1 (or 10%) to Sunak failing to be elected. Since these events are independent, we can simply add the probabilities to get the final probability. 0.2 (Ramaswamy being the nominee) + 0.1 (Sunak failing to be elected) = 0.3"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.006098957215731171, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.002032985738577057, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1609556949949126, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The question does not provide explicit information about the performance of Greece and Lithuania in the competition, nor the overall competitiveness of the Semi-finals. However, we can make some general assumptions based on the structure of the Eurovision competition. Eurovision has two Semi-finals, each with a limited number of spots available for the Grand Final. The allocation of spots is typically determined by a combination of jury and public voting. The countries that are likely to qualify are often those with strong performances in the past, a large and dedicated fan base, or a combination of both. Given that Greece and Lithuania are both participating countries, it is possible that they could both qualify for the Grand Final. However, the likelihood of this occurring depends on various factors, such as their performance in the Semi-finals, the voting patterns of the jury and public, and the overall competitiveness of the competition. Without more specific information about the performance of Greece and Lithuania, it is difficult to provide a precise estimate of the probability. However, we can make an educated guess based on the general trends and patterns of the competition. Assuming that both countries have a decent chance of qualifying, but not an extremely high chance, we can estimate the probability as follows: The probability that Greece qualifies for the Grand Final is around 30-40% (based on their past performances and the general competitiveness of the competition). The probability that Lithuania qualifies for the Grand Final is around 25-35% (based on their past performances and the general competitiveness of the competition). Since the question asks for the probability that either Greece or Lithuania qualifies, we need to consider the probability of at least one of them qualifying. This can be estimated using the formula: P(Greece or Lithuania qualify) = 1 - P(Both Greece and Lithuania do not qualify). Using the probabilities above, we can estimate the probability as follows: P(Greece or Lithuania qualify) = 1 - (1-0.35)(1-0.4) \u2248 0.63.

Given the complexity of the legal issues involved and the potential for ongoing litigation, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Trump will be removed or blocked from any state's primary election ballot by July 15, 2024. However, I would argue that the probability of such an event occurring is relatively low, as it would require a significant shift in the legal landscape and a consensus among state election officials, courts, and lawmakers."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "7297874a-affd-4f19-9aea-9dbbcf2c413d", "title": "Will either Biden remain President through the end of July 2024 or Trump be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) Biden remains US President through the end of July 2024 (ET).

Firstly, let's consider Biden's chances of remaining President. Assuming he is healthy and there are no unforeseen circumstances, it is likely that he will complete his term. However, there is always a small chance of unexpected events such as a serious illness or a scandal that could lead to his resignation or removal. Given the current information, I would estimate the probability of Biden remaining President through the end of July 2024 as around 0.95 (95%). Next, let's consider the likelihood of Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This scenario is more uncertain and depends on various factors such as the outcome of ongoing legal battles, the actions of state election officials, and the decisions of courts. While there have been efforts to remove or block Trump from the ballot in some states, it is unclear whether these efforts will be successful. Given the current information, I would estimate the probability of Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as around 0.2 (20%). Since the question asks for the probability that either of these scenarios occurs, we need to consider the probability of their union. Assuming that the two events are independent, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). In this case, P(A and B) is the probability that both events occur, which is zero since they are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the probability of either event occurring is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.95 + 0.2 = 1.15, which is not possible since probabilities cannot exceed 1.

Condition (a) involves the EU announcing tariffs on Chinese EVs before July 5, 2024. The EU has been increasing its scrutiny of Chinese imports, including electric vehicles, due to concerns over trade imbalances and national security. However, the EU's decision-making process on trade policies can be complex and influenced by various factors, including diplomatic relations with China, economic considerations, and internal politics. While it's possible that the EU might announce tariffs, there's no concrete evidence to suggest it's a high-probability event. I'd estimate the likelihood of this occurring as around 0.3, as it's not a certainty but not entirely implausible either. Condition (b) involves at least 5 Democratic House Members or Senators urging Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024. This condition is more speculative, as it relies on the actions of individual politicians and their willingness to publicly express their opinions. While there have been instances of politicians questioning Biden's candidacy, it's uncommon for a group of 5 or more to collectively ask him to drop out. The likelihood of this occurring is harder to estimate, but considering the current political landscape and the fact that Biden is still a popular figure within the Democratic Party, I'd assign a lower probability to this event.

Since the question resolves as 'Yes' if either condition is met, I'll combine the probabilities using the OR rule, which states that the probability of an event A or B occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each event minus the probability of both events occurring.

First, let's consider Joe Biden's announcement. As of the current date, there is no indication that Joe Biden plans to not seek re-election. In fact, he has expressed his intention to run for re-election in 2024. However, it's also possible that he may change his mind or face unexpected circumstances that could lead him to withdraw from the race. Given the current information, I would estimate the probability of Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President before July 15, 2024, as relatively low, around 10-20%. Next, let's consider the likelihood of a member of the Trump family becoming the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. While it's possible that one of the Trump family members could run for the nomination, the Republican primary field is likely to be crowded, and it's difficult to predict who will emerge as the nominee. However, if we consider the popularity and name recognition of the Trump family members, it's possible that one of them could gain traction and become a serious contender. I would estimate the probability of a member of the Trump family becoming the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 as around 20-30%. However, since we are interested in the probability that either of the two events will occur, we need to consider the intersection of these two probabilities. In other words, we need to consider the probability that both events occur. Since these events are not mutually exclusive, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the probability. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate the probability as follows: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) where P(A) is the probability of Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President before July 15, 2024, and P(B) is the probability of a member of the Trump family becoming the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024.

First, let's consider the men's 100m dash record. The current Olympic record is 9.63s, set by Usain Bolt in 2009. To break this record, an athlete would need to run significantly faster than the current world record holder, which is still under 9.5s. While it's possible that a talented athlete could achieve this, it's a challenging task, and the probability of someone breaking the record is relatively low. Assuming a 10% chance of an athlete breaking the record (a generous estimate), we can proceed with this value. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Individual Neutral Athletes winning \u226515 gold medals. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the top 5 countries by gold medals were the United States, China, Japan, Great Britain, and Russian Olympic Committee (ROC). Individual Neutral Athletes (INA) finished 6th with 5 gold medals. Given the competitive nature of the Olympics, it's difficult to predict which countries will perform well. However, assuming a 20% chance of INA winning \u226515 gold medals (a relatively high estimate), we can proceed with this value. Since these events are independent, we can combine their probabilities using the multiplication rule. The probability that either event occurs is the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring, which is 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3. However, we need to consider the possibility that both events occur simultaneously. This is a more complex scenario, and it's difficult to estimate the probability of both events happening. For the sake of this analysis, let's assume that the probability of both events occurring is negligible (less than 0.05). This is a conservative estimate, as it's unlikely that both events would occur simultaneously.

However, the real factor that could influence my prediction is how the rules have changed. The 'jury and public voting threshold' rule could make all the difference, as having more countries voting for or against them might affect qualification. Without specific information that they have qualified, their participation in a Semi-Final is necessary for an answer. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) typically announces qualification for those that have a high or close enough number of public and jury votes. Overall, while I think that they have a chance (the 10th rank they got last time will likely be beaten), that they have been chosen with an artist who has even participated in the contest the previous year with a lower ranked song in the current competition year will likely limit the chances for a rank in the top 9 spots that qualify for Grand Final.

Firstly, let's consider the market capitalization aspect. As of my last update, Apple's market capitalization is generally larger than Nvidia's. However, market capitalization can fluctuate significantly due to various market and economic factors. To estimate the probability of Nvidia's market capitalization surpassing Apple's on a specific date, we would need to consider historical trends, the companies' financial performance, and current market conditions. However, without access to real-time or more detailed financial data, I'll provide a conservative estimate based on general market trends. Historically, Nvidia's market capitalization has been volatile and has shown rapid growth due to its strong performance in the tech sector, particularly in the areas of graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, Apple, being a more diversified company with a significant presence in consumer electronics and services, has a more stable market capitalization. The likelihood of Nvidia surpassing Apple's market capitalization by a significant margin on a specific date, like July 17, 2024, is low but not impossible, especially if there are unforeseen events or significant market shifts. Next, let's consider the second condition: at least 5 named Democratic lawmakers pressuring Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024. Political decisions and the dynamics of political pressure are inherently difficult to predict with certainty. However, it's worth noting that the political landscape can be influenced by a variety of factors, including party dynamics, public opinion, and the specific policies or scandals surrounding the President. While there have been instances in the past where political pressure has led to significant changes in political decisions, predicting such an event requires a deep understanding of the political climate, which can be subject to numerous variables and uncertainties. Given the complexity of these factors and the lack of specific information about future political developments, it's challenging to assign a precise probability to either condition. However, considering the general trends in both the tech and political sectors, I'll provide a conservative estimate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.19972386430977584, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.06657462143659194, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6523280730534423, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, regarding event (a), Joe Biden has not shown any signs of stepping down as the Democratic nominee for President. He has been actively campaigning and has not publicly expressed any intention to withdraw from the race.

The probability of a country qualifying is influenced by various factors, including the quality of their entry, the voting system, and the competition from other participating countries.

The Olympics bring together top athletes from around the world, and the selection process for participating countries results in a diverse set of teams with varying levels of athletic development. However, several factors suggest that seeing 5 or more nations achieving their first-ever Olympic gold medal is plausible during any Olympics. Firstly, there are a large number of participating countries, so there's a higher pool of nations that could still be looking for their Olympic breakthrough. Secondly, events with high participation numbers sometimes give countries their first big breakthrough, and there would likely be several such gold medals given out. Yet, a key factor preventing 5 or more than countries winning their first was not that it was physically impossible but rather that every Olympics usually has a big number of countries that typically dominate gold medals. Also, gold medals are most commonly awarded in sports areas like swimming, track/field, and gymnastics which often have a concentration of a few countries making them highly competitive.

First, let's consider Sha'Carri Richardson's chances of winning a gold medal. Richardson is a talented sprinter, and her participation in the Women's 100m and Women's 4x100m Relay events increases her chances of winning a gold medal. However, the competition in track and field events at the Olympics is extremely high, and Richardson will face stiff competition from other top athletes.

Next, let's consider the likelihood of France placing in the top 5 in the medal table. France has a strong track record in the Olympics, and their athletes have consistently performed well in various events. However, the medal table is highly competitive, and many countries will be vying for a top 5 spot. Assuming France's athletes perform at a similar level to their past performances, I would estimate their chances of placing in the top 5 to be around 20-25%. Now, since the question resolves positively if either of the events occurs, we need to consider the probability of at least one of these events happening. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this probability. Let's assume the events are independent (which is a reasonable assumption given the different nature of the events). Then, the probability of at least one event occurring is given by: P(at least one event) = P(event a) + P(event b) - P(event a and event b).

Firstly, let's consider the likelihood of Biden dropping out before July 20. As of my knowledge cutoff, there hasn't been any credible information suggesting that Biden plans to drop out, and he has consistently maintained a strong position in the polls. However, it's essential to consider the uncertainty surrounding his health and any potential challenges he might face in the campaign. The probability of Biden dropping out before July 20 is relatively low, but not impossible. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Kamala Harris announcing her VP pick as Kelly or Shapiro before August 7. The VP selection process is often a closely guarded secret, and it's challenging to predict with certainty who the final pick will be. However, Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are both well-known and respected figures in the Democratic Party, and they have been mentioned as potential VP candidates. The probability of Harris announcing either of them as her running mate before August 7 is higher than Biden dropping out, but still uncertain. To combine these probabilities, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The probability of either event occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring. However, since the events are not mutually exclusive (i.e., Biden dropping out could potentially influence Harris's VP pick), we need to be cautious when combining the probabilities. Assuming a conservative estimate for Biden dropping out before July 20 (10%) and a moderate estimate for Harris announcing Kelly or Shapiro as her VP pick before August 7 (30%), we can combine these probabilities. However, we need to consider the potential overlap between the two events, which is difficult to quantify. To err on the side of caution, let's assume a low overlap (5%).

The K-index is a measure of the geomagnetic disturbance, with higher values indicating more intense storms. 2. Solar activity: The K-index is influenced by solar activity, particularly solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). During periods of high solar activity, the likelihood of strong geomagnetic storms increases. 3.

Frequency of geomagnetic storms: Geomagnetic storms are relatively rare events, and a K-index of 5 or higher is even less common. According to the National Weather Service, the K-index is a scale that measures the intensity of geomagnetic storms, with Kp = 5 being a moderate storm and Kp = 6 being a strong storm. 2. Seasonal variation: Geomagnetic storms are more frequent during the solar maximum, which typically occurs every 11 years. However, the current solar cycle (Solar Cycle 25) is expected to be relatively weak, which might reduce the likelihood of intense geomagnetic storms. 3. Predictive models and forecasts: While I don't have direct access to real-time data or predictive models, I can use general knowledge to make an educated estimate. Typically, space weather forecasting relies on monitoring solar activity, such as sunspot activity and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), to predict geomagnetic storms. 4. Historical data: Although I don't have specific historical data on geomagnetic storms during the specified period, I can consider the general trend of geomagnetic storms over the past few years. There have been some notable storms in recent years, but their intensity and frequency have been relatively low. Considering these factors, while it's difficult to predict the exact likelihood of a geomagnetic storm with a K-index between 5 and 6, I'm inclined to think that such an event is not extremely unlikely, but also not highly probable.

The Kp index is a measure of the disturbance of the Earth's magnetic field caused by solar activity, with higher values indicating more intense storms. The Kp index is typically measured on a scale from 0 to 9. The probability of a geomagnetic storm with a K-index greater than 4 and less than or equal to 6 can be influenced by several factors, including solar activity, the orientation of the Earth's magnetic field, and the strength of the interplanetary magnetic field. However, without specific data on these factors, we can make an educated estimate based on general trends. Geomagnetic storms with a K-index greater than 4 are relatively common during periods of high solar activity, while the likelihood of a storm with a K-index less than or equal to 6 is lower, as this range typically corresponds to moderate to strong storms. Considering the time frame of July 17 to July 28, 2024, July is usually a relatively quiet month for geomagnetic storms, with occasional minor disturbances.

Firstly, the Republican National Convention is a democratic process where delegates vote to select the party's nominee. This process can be unpredictable and influenced by various factors such as campaign strategies, debate performances, and shifts in public opinion. While Vivek Ramaswamy has been a vocal figure in the Republican Party, his chances of being selected as the nominee depend on his ability to appeal to a broad base of Republican voters and delegates. Furthermore, the Republican Party has a history of selecting nominees who have a strong appeal to its conservative base, and Vivek Ramaswamy's ideology aligns with this. However, the party also needs to consider the broader national appeal of its nominee, and Ramaswamy's chances of being selected as the nominee would be higher if he can demonstrate a strong ability to appeal to a wider audience. Given these considerations, while it is difficult to assign a precise probability to Ramaswamy being the Republican nominee, I believe that his chances are low but not negligible.

First, let's consider Trump's lead over Biden. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the polling averages were relatively close, with Trump leading by a small margin. However, given the dynamic nature of the election and the potential for changes in polling averages, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether Trump's lead will be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024. Regarding Vivek Ramaswamy's chances of becoming the Republican nominee, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, he was considered a long-shot candidate. While it's possible that he could gain traction and be selected as the nominee, it's also possible that other candidates, such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley, could emerge as the front-runners. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability that Trump's lead over Biden will be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, as 0.2 (20%). This is a relatively low probability, as the polling averages are subject to change and it's difficult to predict with certainty. Similarly, I would estimate the probability that Vivek Ramaswamy will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election as 0.05 (5%). This is a very low probability, as he is considered a long-shot candidate and other candidates are more likely to emerge as the front-runners. However, since the question resolves as Yes if either of the two conditions are met, we need to consider the probability of either event occurring. Assuming that the two events are independent, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). In this case, P(A) is the probability that Trump's lead over Biden will be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, and P(B) is the probability that Vivek Ramaswamy will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Since P(A and B) is the probability that both events occur, and it's unlikely that both events will occur simultaneously, we can assume that P(A and B) is close to 0. Therefore, the probability that either Trump's lead over Biden will be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, or Vivek Ramaswamy will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election is: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) \u2248 0.2 + 0.05 - 0 \u2248 0.25 (25%)"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, their recent performances have been less impressive. In the 2020 contest, Lithuania finished 17th in the semi-finals, and Azerbaijan finished 8th in the same semi-finals.

Additionally, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has a set of rules and selection processes that determine which countries participate in the semi-finals and the Grand Final.

While it is difficult to predict which specific candidates will emerge as front-runners or contenders, the mentioned individuals (Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, and Biden) are all plausible candidates who could potentially participate in debates. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has a history of organizing debates, and it is likely that they will continue to do so in 2024 to facilitate the nomination process. However, there are also some factors that could potentially reduce the likelihood of debates: The DNC has been exploring alternative formats for debates, such as town halls or online forums, which could potentially reduce the number of traditional debates.

First, let's analyze the likelihood of (a). The Republicans Party and the National Rally have a history of cooperation, and they have been discussing a potential alliance for the 2024 legislative election. However, the parties have not yet made an official announcement about a coalition agreement.

The resolution is based on a specific formula, but without access to the actual poll results, we can't directly calculate this. However, we can consider the general trend of Trump's popularity and the potential factors that might influence his vote share in a poll. The condition requires a 3% difference, which is a relatively small margin, and it's uncertain whether this will happen given the variability in poll results. For condition (2), we are looking at whether credible sources report that Donald Trump has testified at the hush money trial. This is a more concrete event that can be tracked, but the uncertainty lies in whether the sources will report it in a timely manner and whether the event will occur at all. Considering these factors, the probability of condition (1) resolving YES is relatively low, around 20-30%, due to the small margin required and the uncertainty in poll results. The probability of condition (2) resolving YES is harder to estimate without real-time information on the trial and the sources reporting on it. However, given the importance of the trial and the likelihood of it being reported, I would estimate this probability to be around 40-50%.

Croatia must participate in a Semi-final and be officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Grand Final. Given that the resolution date for this question is May 7th, 2024, we can infer that the Semi-finals for Eurovision 2024 have likely taken place around this time. The EBU typically announces the qualified countries from each Semi-final shortly after the live broadcast. While we don't have information on whether Croatia participated in the Semi-final or not, the fact that the resolution date is close to the time when the qualified countries would have been announced suggests that the outcome is likely to be known by then. However, without explicit information on Croatia's participation status or the outcome of the Semi-final, we can't definitively conclude that they will qualify. But considering the proximity of the resolution date to the announcement of qualified countries, it's reasonable to assume that the outcome is likely to be known. Assuming that the EBU's qualification process is fair and unbiased, and that the Semi-finals have taken place, the probability of Croatia being officially announced as a qualified country would depend on their performance in the Semi-final. However, without any information on Croatia's performance, we can make an educated guess based on the typical distribution of qualified countries. In previous Eurovision contests, around 7-8 countries from each Semi-final have qualified for the Grand Final. Assuming a similar distribution for Eurovision 2024, the probability of Croatia qualifying would be roughly around 1 in 10, or 10%, assuming they participated in the Semi-final. However, since we don't know if Croatia participated or not, we should adjust the probability downwards to account for this uncertainty. Let's assume a 50% chance that Croatia participated in the Semi-final (this is a rough estimate and could be higher or lower depending on various factors). Combining these probabilities, we get: P(Croatia qualifies | participated) = 10% P(participated) = 50% Using the law of total probability, we can calculate the overall probability of Croatia qualifying as follows: P(Croatia qualifies) = P(Croatia qualifies | participated) * P(participated) + P(Croatia qualifies | did not participate) * P(did not participate) = 0.1 * 0.5 + 0 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.05. However, this calculation assumes that Croatia cannot qualify if they did not participate, which is not necessarily true. If Croatia did not participate, they would still be considered qualified for the Grand Final. To account for this, we can adjust the calculation as follows: P(Croatia qualifies) = P(Croatia qualifies | participated) * P(participated) + P(Croatia qualifies | did not participate) * P(did not participate) = 0.1 * 0.5 + 1 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.05 + 0.5 = 0.55. However, this is still an overestimation, since we know that Croatia cannot qualify if they did not participate, and the probability of them participating is only 50%. A more accurate calculation would be: P(Croatia qualifies) = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05. This calculation assumes that Croatia's qualification status is independent of whether they participated or not, which is not necessarily true. However, it provides a lower bound on the probability of Croatia qualifying.

First, let's consider the number of Semi-finals. Eurovision 2024 will likely have two Semi-finals, as it has in previous years. This means that each country will have two opportunities to qualify. Next, we need to consider the likelihood of each country qualifying. The qualification process is based on a combination of jury and public votes. While we don't have specific information on the voting patterns for Czechia and Georgia, we can look at their past performance in Eurovision. Czechia has participated in Eurovision several times, but has not yet qualified for the Grand Final.

However, the recent trend has been relatively stable, with only a few instances of significant increases. Given the current economic conditions and the fact that the question is asking for a specific threshold (0.1% increase), I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as relatively low, around 20-30%. This is because a 0.1% increase is a relatively small change, and the Core CPI has been trending downward or stable in recent months. Next, let's consider the probability of Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4. This event is extremely rare and would require a significant and unexpected development. The 25th Amendment has been invoked only a handful of times in U.S. history, and Section 4 has never been used. The process of invoking Section 4 also involves a high level of coordination and agreement among the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet, which makes it even more unlikely. Given the current political climate and the fact that there is no clear indication of Biden's incapacitation, I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as extremely low, around 1-5%. Since these two events are independent, I can combine their probabilities using the rule of multiplication. However, since the second event is so unlikely, it will have a negligible impact on the overall probability. Therefore, the combined probability will be roughly equal to the probability of the first event, which is around 20-30%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.012003936033167628, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.004001312011055876, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15504341823651052, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

His experience and name recognition could be assets in his bid for the nomination. However, the Republican Party has undergone significant changes since Christie's last presidential run, with the rise of new figures and shifting ideological currents. The party's base has become increasingly conservative, and Christie's moderate reputation might make it challenging for him to appeal to this faction. Additionally, the 2024 Republican primary field is expected to be crowded, with several potential candidates already mentioned or rumored to be considering a run. This could make it difficult for Christie to stand out and secure the nomination.

Firstly, Chris Christie's chances of becoming the Republican nominee are not explicitly stated, but based on the current political landscape, he is one of the many candidates vying for the nomination. Without recent polls or updates, it's difficult to assign a specific probability to his nomination. However, considering the number of candidates and the unpredictable nature of primary elections, I'll assign a relatively low probability to this event. Secondly, regarding Biden dropping out before 7/13, the probability of this event occurring is also difficult to estimate. While it's possible that Biden might face challenges or controversies that could lead to his withdrawal, his decision to run for re-election was announced in April 2023, and he has been actively campaigning. Without any recent indicators of his intention to drop out, I'll assign a low probability to this event as well. However, considering the two events separately, the probability of either occurring might be higher when combined. This is because the probability of both events happening is lower than the probability of at least one of them occurring. Using the principle of complementary probability, we can estimate the probability of at least one of these events happening. Assuming a low probability of Chris Christie becoming the nominee (let's say 0.05) and a low probability of Biden dropping out before 7/13 (let's say 0.02), the probability of neither event occurring would be approximately 1 - (0.05 + 0.02 - 0.05*0.02) = 0.9323.

However, the UK government has consistently refused to grant permission for a referendum, citing the need for a Section 30 order, which would require the approval of the UK Parliament. Despite this, there are ongoing efforts to hold a referendum through other means, such as a private members' bill or a court challenge. Additionally, the Scottish Government has been exploring the possibility of holding a referendum under the Scotland Act 1998, which would not require UK government consent. However, the UK government has also taken steps to prevent a referendum from being held, including the introduction of the Elections (Reform etc.) Bill, which would make it more difficult for a referendum to be held.

For event (a), Inflection publishing a report with results from external red-teaming of their models by June 30, 2024, we can consider the company's past behavior and the general pace of AI model development and safety research. Inflection has been actively working on AI models and has made significant progress in the field. While there is no public information on their specific plans for external red-teaming, it is common practice in the industry to conduct such evaluations to ensure model safety. Given the importance of model safety, it is likely that Inflection will prioritize this aspect and publish a report on the results of external red-teaming. However, without explicit information on their plans, we cannot assign a high probability to this event. For event (b), OpenAI's ChatGPT being generally available in the European Union by June 30, 2024, we can look at OpenAI's past behavior and the regulatory environment in the EU. OpenAI has been expanding its services to new regions, and the EU has been a significant market for them. However, the company has also faced regulatory challenges in the past, which may have delayed the rollout of ChatGPT in the EU. Considering the complexity of regulatory compliance and the potential for further delays, it is uncertain whether ChatGPT will be generally available in the EU by June 30, 2024. Given the uncertainty surrounding both events, we can estimate the probability of either event occurring by June 30, 2024. The probability of event (a) is around 0.6, considering the likelihood of Inflection prioritizing model safety and publishing a report on external red-teaming. The probability of event (b) is around 0.4, considering the regulatory challenges and potential delays in the rollout of ChatGPT in the EU. To estimate the probability of either event occurring, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's assume that the probability of event (a) is 0.6 and the probability of event (b) is 0.4. The probability of either event occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each event minus the probability of both events occurring. However, since the events are not mutually exclusive, we need to consider the probability of both events occurring. Without explicit information on the relationship between the two events, we can assume that they are independent. In this case, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the probabilities of each event: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.

For event (a), Joe Biden dropping out of the presidential race at least 6 hours in advance, I consider the following factors: Joe Biden's age and health: As a 80-year-old candidate, there is a risk of health issues that could force him to drop out. However, he has shown resilience and determination to continue his campaign. Campaign dynamics: The Democratic primary is highly competitive, and Biden's chances of winning the nomination are uncertain. If he faces a strong challenge, he might consider dropping out to avoid a damaging defeat. Media coverage: A reliable media outlet covering Biden's dropout would require a credible source to confirm the news. This could happen if Biden's team announces his withdrawal or if a significant number of delegates switch their support to another candidate. Given these factors, I assess the likelihood of event (a) as relatively low, around 10-20%.

For event (b), Donald Trump Jr. being selected as the Republican nominee, I consider the following factors: Donald Trump Jr.'s popularity and electability: While he is a well-known figure, his popularity and electability are uncertain. He lacks the experience and charisma of his father, and his nomination would be a significant departure from the traditional Republican Party. Republican Party dynamics: The Republican Party is known for its conservative and establishment wings. Donald Trump Jr.'s nomination would require a significant shift in the party's ideology and a strong endorsement from the Trump family.

Firstly, let's consider the probability of Francis Suarez being selected as the Republican nominee. As of now, it's difficult to predict with certainty who will be the nominee, but we can make an educated guess based on current trends and polling. While Suarez has been mentioned as a potential candidate, he is not a well-known figure, and it's uncertain whether he will gain enough support from the delegates at the Republican National Convention. I will assign a relatively low probability to this event. Next, let's consider the probability of FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024. FiveThirtyEight's election forecast is based on a complex model that takes into account various factors, including polling data, economic indicators, and other variables. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, FiveThirtyEight's model has a good track record of accuracy in previous elections. However, the 2024 election is still over a year away, and many factors can influence the outcome. I will assign a moderate probability to this event. Now, let's consider the combined probability of either condition being met. Since these events are not mutually exclusive, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the combined probability. However, without more information about the relationship between these events, we will simply add the probabilities. Based on these considerations, I estimate the probability of Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee as 0.05 (5%) and the probability of FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024, as 0.30 (30%).

Taylor Swift's past collaborations with Deadpool creator Ryan Reynolds: There is no public information about Taylor Swift working with Ryan Reynolds on any projects, which suggests a low likelihood of her cameoing in the movie. 2. The movie's production timeline: The movie's release date is July 29, 2024, which means the production likely started at least a year ago. Given the high profile of the movie and the involvement of major studios, it's likely that the cast has been finalized. 3. The type of movie: Deadpool and Wolverine is an action-comedy superhero film, which typically involves a large ensemble cast. Taylor Swift's cameo would be a significant surprise, and it's unlikely that the filmmakers would keep it under wraps without any leaks. Considering these factors, I would say that the probability of Taylor Swift cameoing in Deadpool and Wolverine is low. For the second part of the question, I'll consider the following factors: 1.

This is a relatively high sum, and it's likely that the movie's opening will be close to or exceed this amount. 2. Marketing and hype: The movie has a large marketing budget, and the involvement of major studios suggests that they are expecting a significant box office performance. 3. Competition: The movie is opening in a crowded summer season, which might affect its box office performance.

As of my knowledge cutoff, Tucker Carlson is a well-known media personality and a prominent figure in the Republican Party, but he has not been a serious contender for the presidential nomination in the past. The Republican National Convention typically selects the nominee through a combination of primary elections, caucuses, and delegate selection.

Given the current field of candidates and the party's past preferences, I would estimate the probability of Carlson being nominated as low.

While it's possible that he could drop out due to health issues, family concerns, or other personal reasons, it's unlikely given his experience and the fact that he has already announced his candidacy.

While it's difficult to predict future market performance, Nvidia has been a growing company in the tech sector, especially with its dominance in the field of artificial intelligence and graphics processing units (GPUs).

Elon Musk's compensation package: The package is highly unusual, with a $57 billion value, which is likely to attract attention from investors and proxy advisory firms. ISS has previously criticized similar compensation packages as excessive. 3. Kimbal Musk's re-election: As a director on the Tesla board, Kimbal Musk may have a conflict of interest, given his family relationship with Elon Musk. ISS may scrutinize his re-election bid, especially if they perceive it as a potential conflict of interest. 4. ISS's past behavior: ISS has a history of criticizing excessive executive compensation and has been vocal about the need for more transparency and accountability in corporate governance. 5.

Firstly, for condition (a), we need to consider the number of traders in the linked market before the market close on July 15th. The number of traders required is 377, which is a specific threshold. While I don't have real-time data on the current number of traders, I can consider general trends in the market and the time frame given. Typically, the number of traders in a market grows over time as more people become aware of it and participate. However, without specific information about the market's growth rate or any factors that might hinder its growth, it's difficult to accurately predict the number of traders by the end of July 15th. Nonetheless, it's reasonable to assume that the market will likely have at least some growth, but whether it reaches 377 traders is uncertain. I'll assign a moderate probability to this condition. For condition (b), the likelihood of ISS advising Tesla shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election depends on ISS's general stance and the factors they consider when making recommendations. ISS typically bases its recommendations on a variety of factors, including governance practices, executive compensation, and company performance. While it's possible that ISS could recommend against the pay package or the re-election, their stance is usually influenced by a thorough analysis of these factors. Without specific information on ISS's current views or any recent changes in Tesla's governance or performance, it's hard to estimate the likelihood of ISS advising a vote against. However, given the significant attention and scrutiny around executive compensation and governance practices in high-profile companies, it's plausible that ISS might advise against certain executive compensation packages or board member re-elections in certain circumstances. Thus, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to this condition. Considering these assessments, the probability of either condition occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each condition occurring.

Secondly, the World Health Assembly is a global gathering of health ministers from WHO member states, and the approval of the agreement would require a majority vote. While it's difficult to predict the voting behavior of individual countries, we can look at the current momentum and support for the agreement. Thirdly, the resolution date is set for June 2, 2024, which is after the May 2024 World Health Assembly. This suggests that the outcome of the vote will be known by then, and the question will resolve based on the official reports from credible sources.

Firstly, OpenAI's commitment to the principle is not a given.

Historically, the number of world records broken at the Olympics has varied greatly. In some Olympics, there were few or no world records broken, while in others, many records were broken. For instance, at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, 24 world records were broken, but at the 2012 London Olympics, only 8 world records were broken.

Given these factors, it's difficult to make a precise prediction about the number of world records that will be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, we can consider the historical trend of the Olympics and the factors that influence world records being broken. On average, world records are broken at a rate of around 10-20 per Olympics. However, considering the factors mentioned above, it's possible that the Paris Olympics could see a higher number of world records broken.

The Semi-finals are typically held before the Grand Final, and the top 10 countries from each Semi-final qualify for the Grand Final. Considering these factors, while it's difficult to predict with certainty whether Switzerland will qualify for the Grand Final, I would argue that they have a moderate chance of doing so.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) typically announces the qualified countries through a random draw, but the exact process and weights for the draw are not publicly disclosed. However, we can make some general assumptions based on past performance and other factors. Both Norway and Switzerland have been regular participants in Eurovision and have had some successful runs in the past. Norway has won the competition twice, and Switzerland has also had some top 10 finishes. However, the competition is highly unpredictable, and many factors can influence a country's chances of qualifying, such as the quality of their entry, the voting patterns of the jury and public, and the overall mood of the competition. Given these factors, it's difficult to assign a precise probability to either country qualifying. However, we can consider the general odds of qualifying for the Grand Final, which are typically around 40-50% for the top 10 countries in the Semi-finals. Assuming that Norway and Switzerland are among the top 10 countries in their respective Semi-finals, we can estimate their probability of qualifying as follows: Norway: 45% (based on their past performance and the quality of their entries) Switzerland: 42% (based on their past performance and the voting patterns of the jury and public) Since the question asks for the probability that either Norway or Switzerland will qualify, we need to add the probabilities of each country qualifying and subtract the probability of both countries qualifying (to avoid double-counting). Assuming that the probabilities of qualifying are independent, we can estimate the probability of either country qualifying as follows: P(qualifying) = P(Norway qualifying) + P(Switzerland qualifying) - P(both qualifying) = 0.45 + 0.42 - 0.18 (assuming a 40% chance of both countries qualifying) = 0.69. However, this calculation assumes that the probabilities of qualifying are independent, which may not be the case. The EBU's draw process and the voting patterns of the jury and public can influence the chances of both countries qualifying. Therefore, we may need to adjust the probability downward to reflect the potential correlation between the two countries' performances.

This slowdown is likely to impact Nvidia's revenue and profitability, which could lead to a further decline in its stock price. 4.

Looking at the past data, the Core CPI has shown a relatively steady increase over the years, with some fluctuations. However, there is no clear indication of a significant increase or decrease in the near future. One thing to consider is the current economic conditions, such as inflation rates, interest rates, and employment rates. However, without access to real-time data, it's difficult to make a direct correlation between these factors and the Core CPI increase. Another factor to consider is the seasonality of the data.

First, let's look at Nvidia's stock price. Historically, the stock price has been volatile, but it has generally trended upwards over the long term. However, there have been periods of significant decline, such as in 2022 due to the crypto market downturn and the ongoing semiconductor industry challenges. Given the current economic uncertainty and the potential for further market volatility, it is plausible that Nvidia's stock price could close below $100 per share on any day before 7/31. Next, let's consider the trend of the US Core CPI. The Core CPI has been increasing steadily over the past year, with some fluctuations. However, the month-over-month increase has been relatively stable, with an average increase of around 0.2-0.3%. While it's possible that the Core CPI could increase by more than 0.1% in July, it's also possible that it could continue to follow its historical trend and increase by a more moderate amount. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of event (a) occurring (Nvidia's stock price closing below $100) as around 0.4. This is because while there are historical precedents for significant declines in Nvidia's stock price, there is also a strong upward trend in the long term. For event (b) (the month-over-month US Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1%), I would estimate the probability as around 0.6. This is because the Core CPI has been increasing steadily over the past year, and while there is some variability from month to month, an increase of more than 0.1% is not an uncommon occurrence. However, since the question asks for the probability of either event occurring, I will need to combine these two probabilities. Since the two events are not mutually exclusive, I will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the combined probability. Assuming the events are independent, the combined probability would be the sum of the individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring together.

However, without access to real-time information or specific details about Joe Biden's health, I must rely on general knowledge and the passage of time. As of my knowledge cutoff, there is no publicly available information suggesting that Joe Biden's health is deteriorating or that he is in a critical condition.

Firstly, regarding condition (a), the probability of Joe Biden's death before a specific date is inherently difficult to estimate, as it depends on various factors such as his health status, which is not publicly disclosed. However, considering the fact that Joe Biden is 81 years old and has been in good health for the most part of his presidency, it's reasonable to assume that his death before a specific date is a low-probability event. As for condition (b), the probability of the Director of the U.S. Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, resigning or being fired within the next 90 days is also uncertain. While it's possible that she might leave her position due to various reasons such as disagreements with the administration or personal reasons, there is no public information that suggests her departure is imminent. However, considering the high profile nature of the position and the typical tenure of such roles, it's not entirely impossible that she might leave within the specified timeframe. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of condition (a) resolving YES as 0.05 (5%), as it's extremely low for a person of Joe Biden's age to pass away unexpectedly. The probability of condition (b) resolving YES is slightly higher, around 0.3 (30%), considering the uncertainties associated with the tenure of high-profile government officials.

For part (a), we're looking at the possibility of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average. The key information here is the specific date and the polling average value. Since the question is about a future event, we can't rely on historical data, and we'll have to make an educated guess based on general trends and patterns in polling averages. In general, polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as changes in public opinion, campaign events, and sampling errors. However, in the context of a presidential election, it's not uncommon for candidates to have a lead that is within a few percentage points of each other. Given the specificity of the question (Trump's lead being exactly between 2 and 3 points), it's likely that this scenario is possible, but not particularly likely due to the narrow margin. I'd estimate that this scenario has a moderate probability of occurring, but not extremely high or low. For part (b), we're looking at the possibility of a member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. This question is more straightforward in that it's based on a specific event that can be influenced by various factors such as the nomination process, candidate choices, and voter preferences. While it's possible for a member of the Trump family to become the Republican nominee, the nomination process is complex, and there are many factors that can influence the outcome.

Historically, debates have played a significant role in the Democratic primary process, providing a platform for candidates to showcase their policies, leadership skills, and vision for the country. Given the competitive nature of the Democratic primary, it's likely that multiple candidates will emerge as strong contenders, necessitating debates to help voters differentiate between them. Furthermore, the Democratic Party has a history of hosting debates in the lead-up to their national convention. In 2020, for example, there were several debates and town halls featuring Democratic presidential candidates. Given this precedent, it's reasonable to expect that the party will continue this tradition in 2024. Additionally, the fact that the question mentions specific potential nominees, such as Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, and Biden, suggests that these individuals are already being considered as potential candidates. This further supports the likelihood of debates occurring, as these individuals would likely be among those participating in the debates.

First, let's consider the likelihood of Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024. As of my knowledge cutoff, Joe Biden has not made any public statements indicating that he will not seek re-election. In fact, he has expressed his intention to run for re-election in the past. However, it's also possible that he may change his mind or face unexpected challenges that could lead him to reconsider his candidacy. Without any concrete evidence or public statements to the contrary, I would estimate the probability of Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024, to be relatively low, around 0.2 (20%). Next, let's consider the likelihood of there being another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention. The Democratic Party typically holds debates and forums to allow candidates to discuss their platforms and policies. Given the competitive nature of the Democratic primary, it's likely that there will be multiple debates and forums before the convention.

Therefore, I would estimate the probability of there being another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention to be relatively high, around 0.8 (80%). Since the question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs, we can use the law of total probability to combine the probabilities. Let's assume that the two events are independent, which is a reasonable assumption given that they are distinct events. Then, the probability of either event occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring, minus the probability of both events occurring (since we don't want to double-count the overlap). In this case, the probability of both events occurring is very low, since it would require Joe Biden to announce he will not accept the nomination and simultaneously, there would be another Democratic party presidential debate. Therefore, we can ignore the probability of both events occurring.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume a neutral stance and assign a 50% probability to the index being higher on July 20, 2024, than it was on July 20, 2023. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Donald Trump being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at past trends and current events. Donald Trump has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, and his popularity can ebb and flow. However, the Republican National Convention's delegate selection process is complex, and many factors can influence the outcome, including other candidates' campaigns, party politics, and external events. Given the unpredictability of political events, it's challenging to assign a precise probability. However, considering Trump's past performances and his current standing within the party, let's assign a 30% probability of him being the Republican nominee. Finally, we need to combine these two probabilities to find the overall probability that either event occurs. Since the two events are independent, we can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). However, since we're considering the probability of either event occurring, we should actually use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), but in this case, P(A and B) is 0 since the events are mutually exclusive (i.e., the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index cannot be influenced by the Republican National Convention's selection of a nominee). Therefore, the overall probability is simply the sum of the individual probabilities."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, it's essential to note that polling averages can fluctuate over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, campaign strategies, and external events. However, 538's national polling average is considered a reliable indicator of the election landscape. As of my knowledge cutoff, the 2024 presidential election is still in its early stages, and the polling data is subject to change.

However, the lead tends to converge as the election approaches, with the eventual winner often having a narrow lead in the final weeks. Given the current state of the election, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether Trump's lead will be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024.

In the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden's lead over Donald Trump was relatively stable in the final weeks, with Biden maintaining a narrow lead of around 2-4 points in the national polling average. Considering this historical context, it's possible that Trump's lead could be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, especially if there are external events or campaign strategies that shift voter sentiment in Trump's favor.

Firstly, the probability of Ted Cruz being the Republican nominee is difficult to estimate with precision, as it depends on various factors such as the outcome of the primaries, the delegates' decision at the convention, and potential third-party candidates. However, it's worth noting that Ted Cruz has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, and his chances of being nominated are not entirely negligible. Secondly, regarding Trump's lead over Biden, we can look at historical trends and polling averages. In the past, Trump's lead over Biden has fluctuated, and it's impossible to predict with certainty what the polling average will be on July 15, 2024. However, given the current political climate and the fact that Trump's popularity has been volatile, it's possible that his lead could be within the specified range. Considering these points, I would estimate the probability of each condition occurring as follows: Ted Cruz being the Republican nominee: 5% (a relatively low probability due to the uncertainty surrounding the primaries and the convention); Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024: 20% (a moderate probability based on historical polling trends and the volatility of Trump's popularity). Since the question asks for the probability of either condition occurring, we need to consider the probability of both events happening. However, because these events are not mutually exclusive, we should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to avoid double-counting. The probability of both events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of their intersection. Assuming the events are independent, the probability of both events occurring is approximately 5% + 20% = 25%. However, without more information about the intersection of these events, I'll provide a conservative estimate of the probability, taking into account the possibility that both events might not be entirely independent."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Secondly, the listed Israeli leaders have been involved in various controversies and allegations of war crimes.

Herzi Halevi has also been accused of war crimes for his role in the 2021 Gaza War. Thirdly, the ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for other high-profile individuals, including Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. This suggests that the ICC is willing to take bold action against individuals accused of international crimes. However, it's also worth noting that the ICC has been criticized for its slow pace and limited resources.

However, the decision to testify is ultimately up to Trump and his legal team, and there are various factors that could influence this decision, such as the potential consequences of testifying or the desire to avoid controversy.

Firstly, Will Hurd being the Republican nominee is a relatively low-probability event.

The field of candidates is often crowded, and the nomination is usually decided by a combination of factors, including fundraising, polling, and grassroots support.

However, based on past trends and the current state of the Republican Party, I would estimate the probability of Will Hurd being the nominee as around 5%. Secondly, regarding Donald Trump's testimony at the hush money trial, it's essential to consider the legal context and the potential consequences for Trump. While it's possible that Trump may be called to testify, the likelihood of him doing so voluntarily is low, given his history of aggressive legal defense strategies. However, if the prosecution or the court orders him to testify, it's more likely that he will comply. Based on the current information and the legal process, I would estimate the probability of Donald Trump testifying at the trial as around 30%.

Different regions might show varying levels of enthusiasm or apathy towards European elections, potentially affecting the share of votes for different political groups. 2. Electorate divisions within the group: While the GUE/NGL has traditionally enjoyed strong support among left-leaning voters in Europe, some member parties within the group have had difficulties maintaining electoral momentum or attracting new support. 3. Electoral reform: Member states of the European Parliament may undergo changes to electoral systems in the lead up to 2024 that could boost other parties (such as proportional representation). However, to date there is a historical trend, which in turn may hint at what can be anticipated for future voting trends; The 2004 - 2014 and then 2019 - 2024 term showed trends where it appeared as if GUE/NGL support is becoming weaker and being absorbed more fully by socialists/Social democrats and then again, greens and nationalists and regionalism.

For condition (a), Tucker Carlson becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, I will analyze the likelihood of this event. The Republican National Convention is a critical event that determines the party's nominee. While Tucker Carlson is a prominent figure in the Republican Party, his name recognition and appeal may not be enough to secure the nomination. Historical trends show that party insiders, government officials, or experienced politicians often win the nomination over media personalities. Considering the competition and the requirements of the nomination, I believe the likelihood of Tucker Carlson becoming the nominee is extremely low. For condition (b), Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, in 538's national polling average, I will rely on historical polling data from 538. In this context, it is critical to understand that the odds of Trump's lead satisfying the exact specified condition rely on his overall campaign situation and public support in advance of July 15. Given that a narrow winning margin would suggest uncertainty with Trump's performance on those specific metrics on the July 15 cutoff date \u2013 a period likely before 2024\u2019s actual political season, in full-fledged campaign swing. If Trump performs worse, below a 3 point polling lead on that cutoff data, it may hint poorly on the remaining polls into the August election period due to factors that contribute Trump\u2019s general appeal during competitive campaign phases, leading less likely than his narrow appeal to have any slight chances of success beyond August under a hypothetical poll analysis; the narrow win will seem to show some kind a Trump loss probability higher from July.

First, let's consider the probability of the Republican Party and National Rally forming an alliance. This is a complex political decision that involves negotiations and agreements between two parties with different ideologies. While it's not impossible, it's also not a common occurrence in French politics. Historically, the Republicans and National Rally have had a complicated relationship, and their cooperation is not guaranteed.

The Prime Minister's party affiliation can change due to various reasons such as cabinet reshuffles or changes in government leadership.

Firstly, the question's resolution date is July 17, 2024, which gives us a 2-day window to observe the polling data on July 15, 2024. Historically, presidential election polling has been subject to significant fluctuations, often driven by external events, campaign strategies, and changes in voter sentiment. However, 538's national polling average is designed to smooth out some of these fluctuations by aggregating data from multiple polls. Looking at the current polling trends, we can see that Trump's lead over Biden has been relatively stable in recent weeks, with some minor variations. However, it's essential to note that polling data can be influenced by various factors, such as sampling errors, survey methodology, and respondent bias. Given the stable nature of the recent polling trends and the smoothing effect of 538's national polling average, it's reasonable to assume that Trump's lead on July 15, 2024, will be within a relatively narrow range.

Event (a) is related to specific members of the Trump family becoming the Republican nominee, which is a less directly quantifiable event but past trends suggest it has no more than a moderate (~20-30%) occurrence rate. Event (b) is dependent on vote share differences between Manifold polls, and polls which are not provided. With no information about either manifolds poll regarding, the probability that an observer would be able to come up with a informed best guess is zero in itself. However, by following the instructions of attempting one, we will continue - assuming that we either will have access to past (or similar) instances - or that we trust Trump's popularity is fairly maintained. A simplistic yet reasonable assumption would assume in the absence of opposing force, Trump would fairly match his past polling with past generic democrat - i.e. he is only to gain 3 points and no more, leaving all other voters (man not voting for Trump/trustee) in aggregate moving to the democrat party under the generic option which polls show to have minimal voters. This simplistic line (Trump + generic to Trump + Biden option voting) is not meant by any means to include variance in voter choice by more than 1 voting event, but only so because we have no ability to account for 'another' event, where no one votes. There remains a chance for these manifolds polls for vote share to change either favoring or disfearing Trump. If voters had a chance to actually learn about the democrat the (generic) was supporting under the hypothetical - more disfavor would likely (over time) increase if for no other reason simply because the public wants not to vote for something whose candidate they don't get to know. Another voter may choose to not know/trust the democrat by also not voting for Biden. However this change wouldn't be expected. Finally, we should probably only consider the change expected 'over time' but time is not really that limiting here. If over these 9 days poll - the generic and poll two are not really (we can safely assume without breaking down) any much different than their counterpart vote share in the election than we can also, on the other hand just do the same. Honesty, there probably remains a chance for those events to change over all with the voters but those could be accounted for at such a low probability at even the most extreme voter that we can say as following that we will do assume that they don't either. So the man would have to say yes: (b is expected to be no since only 3% polling with no change over such poll time) (no specific reason for this particular Trump family member but most specific reason for not considering for this particular poll reason not to vote is expected under the generic and we actually have no real vote info to say which vote count is expected).

This is because, while there are several factors that could work against him, his strong following and experience in presidential elections give him a significant advantage."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "cf8e87c4-8413-4f79-b399-bab0f7561176", "title": "On July 21, 2024, will the closing value of BSE SENSEX be greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k?", "body": "This question resolves as the closing value of the BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024, according to Yahoo Finance.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-23T19:39:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2020-08-27T23:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.25, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability that the closing value of BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024, will be greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000, I need to consider various factors that could influence the stock market on that specific date. Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that predicting stock market values with high accuracy is challenging, especially for a specific date in the future. However, we can make an educated guess based on historical trends and general market conditions. Historically, the BSE SENSEX has shown volatility, influenced by various global and domestic factors such as economic indicators, political stability, and global events. Since the question is about a specific future date, I'll consider the general trend and volatility of the market rather than making a prediction based on current market conditions. The question specifies a narrow range (75,000 to 77,000), which suggests a relatively high level of precision. This precision is challenging to achieve in forecasting stock market values, as they can fluctuate significantly over short periods. Given the difficulty in predicting stock market values with high precision, especially for a specific date in the future, I will rely on general market trends and the understanding that historical data does not perfectly predict future outcomes. The BSE SENSEX has been steadily increasing over the years, with some fluctuations. However, predicting whether it will be within a narrow range of 75,000 to 77,000 on a specific date without more context or data is challenging.

First, let's consider the probability of Donald Trump being the Republican nominee. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of the Republican National Convention, we can look at past trends and current polling data. In the 2020 Republican primary, Trump was the incumbent president and a strong frontrunner, but he ultimately lost the nomination to Joe Biden. However, Trump has been a dominant figure in the Republican Party, and it's possible that he could regain the nomination in 2024. That being said, there are many other potential candidates who could also run, including current and former governors, senators, and other prominent Republicans. As for the probability of the BSE SENSEX closing value on July 21, 2024, being greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000, we can look at historical data on the SENSEX. The SENSEX is a widely followed stock market index in India, and it has been steadily increasing over the past few years. However, predicting the exact closing value of the SENSEX on a specific date in the future is extremely challenging, if not impossible. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of either event occurring as follows: Probability of Donald Trump being the Republican nominee: 0.2 (20%) Probability of the BSE SENSEX closing value on July 21, 2024, being greater than 75,000 and less than or equal to 77,000: 0.05 (5%) Since these events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities to get the probability of either event occurring: 0.2 x 0.05 = 0.01 (1%) Therefore, my best estimate for the probability that either of the two events will occur is 0.01 (1%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.9577530418444646, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.31925101394815486, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 1.4680851063829785, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For event (a), we are looking at Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's national polling average on July 15, 2024. Since the polling average can fluctuate, it's difficult to predict with certainty. However, based on historical trends and current polling data, it's possible that Trump's lead could be within the specified range on July 15, 2024. For event (b), a brokered convention is a rare occurrence in US presidential elections. However, the 2024 Democratic primary has been marked by a crowded field and shifting dynamics, which could increase the likelihood of a brokered convention. Some factors that could contribute to this include the performance of candidates in primary elections and caucuses, the impact of debates and other events on candidate popularity, and the potential for a strong third-party candidate to emerge. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as around 0.4, as there is a reasonable chance that Trump's lead could be within the specified range on July 15, 2024. As for event (b), I would estimate the probability of a brokered convention as around 0.2, as while there are some factors that could contribute to this outcome, it is still a relatively rare occurrence in US presidential elections. To estimate the probability that either event will occur, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This states that the probability of either event A or event B occurring is given by P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). However, since the events in this case are not mutually exclusive (i.e., it's possible for both events to occur), we need to be careful when applying this principle. A more accurate approach would be to estimate the probability of the union of the two events by considering the probability of each event occurring and the probability of the intersection of the two events. Given the relatively low probability of a brokered convention (0.2) and the fact that a brokered convention would likely be associated with a Trump lead within the specified range (due to the potential for a strong third-party candidate or a split in the Democratic Party), I would estimate the probability of the intersection of the two events (i.e., a brokered convention and a Trump lead within the specified range) as around 0.05. Applying the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we get: P(event (a) or event (b)) = P(event (a)) + P(event (b)) - P(event (a) and event (b)) = 0.4 + 0.2 - 0.05 = 0.55."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.010475252203653335, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0034917507345511114, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.14494275891311206, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

If Trump testifies, he would have the opportunity to challenge these witnesses' credibility and present his own account of events. 4. Current events: The trial is still ongoing, and the prosecution has yet to present all its evidence. It's possible that the defense may decide to call Trump as a witness to counter the prosecution's case, especially if they feel that his testimony would be beneficial to their strategy. 5. Trump's personality and behavior: Trump is known for being a hands-on and involved defendant, often inserting himself into the legal process and using his public platform to shape the narrative around his cases. This suggests that he may be more likely to testify in his own defense. Considering these factors, while there is no clear indication that Trump will testify, there is also no strong evidence suggesting he won't. Given his history of engaging in high-profile trials and using them as a platform for self-promotion, I estimate that there is a moderate chance he will testify."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "709181f6-b527-4793-90f3-04732afc398f", "title": "Iran military response before August 13th midnight Eastern Time?", "body": "This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Iran initiates a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory between July 30 and August 12, 2024, 11:59 PM ET.

This is a relatively rare event, as it requires the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) to invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. While it's not impossible, it's a significant and deliberate process that would likely be publicly known. As of my knowledge cutoff, there is no indication that such a situation is unfolding.

Since the question asks for the probability that either event occurs, we need to consider the probability of the union of these two events.

Firstly, let's consider the probability of Will Hurd being the Republican nominee. This is a relatively low-probability event, as the Republican National Convention typically has a large number of delegates and the nomination process is often competitive. However, without more information about the current state of the Republican primary, it's difficult to assign a precise probability. For the sake of argument, let's assume a probability of 0.05 (5%) for this event. Next, let's consider the probability of Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination. This event is also relatively low-probability, as Joe Biden has not yet announced his decision to run for re-election and it's unclear whether he will choose to do so. However, it's possible that he may decide not to run, especially if his health or other personal circumstances change. Let's assume a probability of 0.10 (10%) for this event. However, the question also specifies that the statement from Joe Biden must be 'unambiguous and conclusive' and 'leave no room for the possibility that Biden would accept the nomination.' This suggests that the probability of Joe Biden making such a statement is even lower than 0.10. Let's assume a probability of 0.05 (5%) for this event.

For part (a), the outcome depends on the performance of Fidesz-KDNP in the 2024 European Parliament elections. While Fidesz-KDNP has been a dominant force in Hungarian politics, the party's popularity has been declining in recent years. The European Parliament elections often have a different dynamic than national elections, and voter turnout and preferences can shift. However, given Fidesz-KDNP's historical strong performance in Hungarian politics and their current popularity, I assign a moderate probability to them maintaining their plurality in the European Parliament. For part (b), the EU has been increasingly concerned about the impact of Chinese electric vehicles on the European market, particularly regarding issues like intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices. The EU has already imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in the past, and it's possible that they might impose new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in response to these concerns. However, the EU's decision-making process is complex and influenced by various factors, including economic, political, and diplomatic considerations. While it's possible that new tariffs could be announced before July 5, 2024, it's not a certainty. Given these considerations, I assign a higher probability to the second condition (b) resolving to 'Yes' than the first condition (a). The EU's regulatory environment and trade policies are subject to various influences, and the decision to impose new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles is more amenable to external factors and bureaucratic processes.

For part (a), the question revolves around the difference in Trump's vote share between two Manifold polls, one with Biden and the other with a generic Democrat. The condition for the question to resolve YES is that Trump's vote share in the first poll must exceed that in the second poll by at least 3%. Since the formula for calculating the vote share is based on the ratio of Trump's votes to the total votes, it is a ratio of proportions. The difference in proportions can be approximated by the difference in the vote counts, but the exact calculation requires knowledge of the actual vote counts, which are not provided. However, we can infer that the polls are designed to test the effect of having a well-known candidate like Biden on the vote share. Without explicit data, we can consider the general trend in polls and the characteristics of the two polls. Typically, having a well-known candidate like Biden on the ballot can increase the vote share of the generic Democrat, but it can also have a negative effect on Trump's vote share due to the coattails effect of a well-known candidate. However, without explicit data, it's hard to estimate the exact effect. Given the lack of information about the polls and the voters, I will assign a moderate probability to part (a) resolving YES.

While it is possible that some Democratic politicians might express their dissatisfaction with Biden's campaign, it is challenging to predict whether a group of at least 5 will collectively pressure him to drop out. This scenario is less likely to occur because it requires a coordinated effort from a specific group of individuals, which is harder to achieve than individual opinions or statements. Additionally, the requirement for at least 5 named individuals and the need for a collective message or action add to the complexity of this scenario. Without explicit information about the political climate, party dynamics, or the willingness of specific politicians to take such action, it is difficult to estimate the probability of this scenario occurring.

First, let's consider the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20, 2024. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at historical trends and current circumstances. Joe Biden has been the Democratic nominee since 2020 and has not shown any signs of dropping out. However, he is 80 years old, and there have been concerns about his age and health. If we assume that Biden's health issues could lead to him dropping out, we might estimate the probability of this event as around 10-20%. However, this is a low-probability event, and I will use 15% as a rough estimate. Next, let's consider the probability of Mike Pence becoming the Republican nominee. Mike Pence has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, and he has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2024 nomination. However, the Republican field is highly competitive, and Pence would face stiff competition from other candidates. If we assume that Pence has a reasonable chance of winning the nomination, we might estimate the probability of this event as around 20-30%. However, this is still a relatively low-probability event, and I will use 25% as a rough estimate. Now, let's combine these probabilities using the 'or' rule, which states that the probability of either event A or event B occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each event minus the probability of both events occurring. Since the events are not mutually exclusive, we need to subtract the probability of both events occurring. In this case, we assume that the probability of both events occurring (Biden dropping out and Pence becoming the nominee) is very low, around 1-2%. We will use 1.5% as a rough estimate. Using the 'or' rule, we can calculate the probability of either event occurring as follows: P(event A or event B) = P(event A) + P(event B) - P(event A and event B) = 0.15 + 0.25 - 0.015 = 0.40.

First, let's consider the probability of a new Moana ride being announced for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024. Disney typically uses D23 as a platform to announce new and upcoming attractions, but they also use it to tease and generate buzz for future projects. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, I'll consider the following factors: the popularity of the Moana franchise, the success of previous Disney theme park announcements at D23, and the fact that Magic Kingdom is a prime location for a Moana-themed ride. However, it's also worth noting that Disney has a history of announcing attractions at other events or conferences, and they often use D23 to discuss ideas and concepts rather than concrete announcements.

However, the success of a movie is difficult to predict, and there are many factors that can influence its performance.

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of each country being officially announced as having qualified for the Grand Final. Assuming that the selection process is fair and unbiased, I would estimate the probability of each country being qualified as around 0.4 (40%). This is a rough estimate, as the actual probability may depend on various factors such as the quality of their performance, the voting patterns of the other countries, and so on. Since the question asks whether either Belgium or Czechia will qualify, we need to consider the probability of at least one of the two countries qualifying. Using the multiplication rule for independent events, we can calculate the probability of both countries not qualifying and then subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least one country qualifying.

Firstly, we can look at the current polling averages. As of my knowledge cutoff, the polling averages are subject to change, but I can provide a general idea of the trends. Historically, the polling averages have shown a high degree of volatility, with Trump's lead often fluctuating between 1-5 points.

Another factor to consider is the uncertainty in polling averages, which can be influenced by various factors such as sampling error, non-response bias, and changes in voter behavior. This uncertainty can lead to a range of possible outcomes, including Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3.

Firstly, the Republican National Convention is scheduled to take place in 2024, and Nikki Haley is one of the potential candidates. However, the Republican nominee is typically chosen through a combination of primary elections and caucuses, which can be unpredictable. While Nikki Haley is a well-known figure in the Republican Party, it's difficult to estimate her chances of becoming the nominee at this point. Secondly, regarding Joe Biden's presidency, he is currently serving as the President of the United States, and his term is set to end on January 20, 2025. However, the possibility of his presidency extending beyond that date depends on various factors, including his decision to run for re-election, his health, and the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Nikki Haley being the Republican nominee as relatively low, around 20-30%. This is because the Republican primary process is highly competitive, and many other candidates are likely to enter the fray. As for Joe Biden still being president by the end of July 2024, I would estimate the probability as around 10-20%. This is because, while it's possible that Biden could still be president at that time, the likelihood of him being re-elected or serving out the remainder of his term is uncertain.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the Republican Party has a history of selecting nominees who are more conservative than moderate, and Haley's moderate views on certain issues may make it more challenging for her to secure the nomination. However, she has a strong track record of building coalitions and has been able to appeal to a broad range of voters in the past. Given these factors, while it's difficult to predict with certainty, I would estimate the probability of Nikki Haley being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election as follows:"}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "40cfa86b-4751-452e-a4ad-8f6be36c9f2b", "title": "Will Joe Biden die before Saturday?", "body": "Resolves YES if there is an official announcement of Joe Biden's death before market close at the end of Friday, July 26th. \n\nOtherwise, resolves NO.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-27T15:19:17Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2021-07-03T07:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.05, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To estimate the probability of Joe Biden dying before Saturday, we need to consider various factors such as his age, health, and any recent health issues.

Firstly, let's consider Nikki Haley's chances of being the Republican nominee. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of the Republican National Convention with certainty, we can look at the current polling and the political landscape. Nikki Haley is a well-known figure in the Republican Party, having served as the Governor of South Carolina and the US Ambassador to the United Nations. However, the Republican primary field is likely to be crowded, and other candidates, such as Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and Ron DeSantis, may also be contenders. While Haley is a strong candidate, it's uncertain whether she will emerge as the nominee. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Joe Biden dying before Saturday. While no one can predict with certainty whether someone will die or not, we can look at Joe Biden's age and health. He is 80 years old and has been in good health, but like any 80-year-old, he is at a higher risk of health issues. However, there is no indication that his health is deteriorating rapidly, and it's unlikely that he will die suddenly before Saturday. Given these considerations, I would estimate that the probability of Nikki Haley being the Republican nominee is relatively low, as the Republican primary field is competitive and unpredictable. On the other hand, the probability of Joe Biden dying before Saturday is extremely low, given his current health status.

According to the Olympic Games' historical data, a significant number of countries have won their first-ever Olympic gold medal in various Olympic Games. However, the number of debutantes winning gold has been decreasing over the years. Assuming a similar trend continues in the 2024 Olympics, we can estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal. However, it's essential to note that the number of participating countries and the competition level have increased over the years, which might affect the number of debutantes winning gold. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal at the 2024 Olympics as follows: The number of countries that have won their first-ever Olympic gold medal is relatively small compared to the total number of participating countries. Let's assume that around 1-2% of participating countries will win their first-ever Olympic gold medal, which is a conservative estimate based on historical data. To estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal, we can use the binomial distribution. Let's assume that there are around 80-100 participating countries in the 2024 Olympics (a rough estimate based on the Olympic Games' historical data). Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal as follows: P(at least 5) = 1 - P(0-4) = 1 - \u03a3[P(k) from k=0 to 4] where P(k) is the probability of k countries winning their debut gold medal. Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate P(k) as follows: P(k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k)) where n is the number of participating countries, k is the number of countries winning their debut gold medal, p is the probability of a country winning its debut gold medal (1-2%), and q is the probability of a country not winning its debut gold medal (98-99%). Plugging in the values, we get: P(0) \u2248 0.419, P(1) \u2248 0.342, P(2) \u2248 0.216, P(3) \u2248 0.125, P(4) \u2248 0.072. Now, we can calculate P(at least 5) as follows: P(at least 5) = 1 - P(0-4) = 1 - (0.419 + 0.342 + 0.216 + 0.125 + 0.072) \u2248 0.066.

This suggests that the number of gold medals won by neutral athletes is generally low. However, it's also worth noting that the number of gold medals won by neutral athletes can vary greatly from one Olympics to another, and there is no clear trend or pattern. Another factor to consider is the increasing number of neutral athletes participating in the Olympics. Neutral athletes are often athletes who are not affiliated with a particular country's national Olympic committee, but are still allowed to compete in the Olympics. This can include athletes who have been banned from competing under their country's flag due to doping scandals or other reasons. The number of neutral athletes has been increasing in recent years, which could potentially lead to more gold medals being won by neutral athletes.

The Republican National Convention is a delegate-based process that is independent of the general election. The outcome of the convention is difficult to predict with certainty, as it depends on various factors such as delegate commitments, candidate strategy, and potential brokered convention scenarios. However, given the current state of the Republican primary, it is unlikely that Ted Cruz will be the eventual nominee, as other candidates such as Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are still in the running. Nevertheless, it is not impossible, and the convention could potentially be a contentious process. Condition (b) requires Kamala Harris's Electoral College probability in Nate Silver's model to increase over the next week. Nate Silver's model is a sophisticated forecasting tool that takes into account various factors such as polling data, economic indicators, and historical trends.

Firstly, Joe Biden has been the incumbent President since 2021, and his decision to run for re-election is likely to be influenced by his performance and the state of the Democratic Party. If he feels that his party is strong and that he has a good chance of winning, he might decide to run again. On the other hand, if he's facing significant opposition from within his party or if his approval ratings are low, he might choose not to run. Secondly, the current political landscape in the United States is complex and dynamic. The Democratic Party is likely to face a challenging election in 2024, with a strong Republican opposition and potential third-party candidates. Joe Biden's decision to run or not might be influenced by his party's chances of winning and his own ability to contribute to their success. Thirdly, Joe Biden has been known to be a pragmatic politician who weighs his options carefully. He might decide not to run if he feels that his presence in the election would harm the Democratic Party's chances of winning or if he's facing significant personal or health issues.

However, they still trail behind the larger groups such as the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). Another factor to consider is the potential impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions imposed on Russia. This could lead to a shift in voter sentiment and potentially benefit far-right and nationalist parties, which often capitalize on anti-immigrant and anti-globalization sentiments. However, it's also possible that the ID group's gains in the 2019 elections were largely due to the rise of populist and nationalist movements in various European countries.
