Firstly, the Republican Party has a history of choosing more established and experienced candidates as their nominees. Secondly, Donald Trump Jr. has not yet demonstrated the same level of political acumen and charisma as his father, which are essential qualities for a presidential candidate. Additionally, the Republican National Convention is a complex process, and the delegates are likely to choose a candidate who has a strong track record of winning primaries and caucuses.

On one hand, Hutchinson has a strong track record as a conservative politician, which could appeal to the Republican base. He also has experience in governance, having served as the Governor of Arkansas since 2015. Additionally, his background in the Trump administration as the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy might be seen as an asset in the Republican primary. On the other hand, the Republican primary field is likely to be crowded and competitive, with many strong candidates vying for the nomination. The Republican Party has a history of favoring more extreme or populist candidates, which might not necessarily align with Hutchinson's moderate stance.

Ted Cruz's past performance: He has shown resilience and ability to compete in Republican primaries, but his 2016 campaign was ultimately unsuccessful. 2. Current party dynamics: The Republican Party is undergoing changes, with shifting priorities and factions vying for influence. This uncertainty might create an opportunity for a dark horse candidate to emerge. 3.

The announcement must be public, official, and unambiguous, leaving no room for interpretation. Given the significance of this announcement, it is unlikely that Biden would make such a statement without careful consideration.

As for the second event, Kamala Harris's odds of winning increasing over the next week according to Nate Silver's model, we need to consider the dynamics of the presidential election. Nate Silver's model is a sophisticated tool that takes into account various factors, including polling data, economic indicators, and historical trends. While it is difficult to predict the exact outcome of the election, we can analyze the current trends and polling data to estimate the likelihood of Harris's odds increasing.

Firstly, Joe Biden's death before July 26th, 2024, is a rare event. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, we can look at the life expectancy of a person of Joe Biden's age and health status. Joe Biden is currently 81 years old, which means he is in a high-risk category for mortality. However, he is also a relatively healthy individual for his age, having been a non-smoker and having a moderate lifestyle. Assuming a moderate life expectancy for a person of his age and health status, the probability of Joe Biden dying before July 26th, 2024, is around 0.5-1% (0.005 to 0.01). Now, regarding the second event, Joe Biden not remaining President through the end of July 2024, this could occur through various means such as resignation, death, or incapacitation. While it's difficult to estimate the probability of each of these events individually, we can consider the overall likelihood of any of these events happening. Historically, the average tenure of a US President is around 4-5 years, with a few exceptions. Given that Joe Biden has been in office since January 2021, it's possible that he may not complete his term due to various reasons. However, without any concrete evidence or indication of his plans to step down, it's hard to estimate this probability accurately. Considering these factors, a more probable scenario is that Joe Biden will remain President through the end of July 2024, especially given the current political climate and his announced plans to run for re-election. However, there is still a small chance that he may not complete his term. Taking all these factors into account, the overall probability of either event (a) or (b) occurring is relatively low, around 0.05-0.1 (5-10%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.918034103032253, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.22950852575806324, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 1.6130709362767586, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This suggests that he has a strong ability to appeal to Republican voters and navigate the nomination process. 2.

His ability to mobilize and maintain support among this base is a key factor in his nomination prospects. 3.

Firstly, let's consider the removal or block from the primary election ballot. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. The question of whether Trump's actions on January 6, 2021, constitute an insurrection or rebellion is a matter of interpretation and ongoing debate. However, it is possible that some states may choose to apply this provision to Trump, particularly given the controversy surrounding his role in the January 6th events.

Firstly, regarding condition (a), the removal or block of Donald Trump from the primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment would require a significant and unprecedented move by state governments or the courts. While there have been discussions and controversies surrounding Trump's eligibility for office, there is no clear indication that any state will take such action by July 15, 2024. Therefore, I consider this outcome to be relatively unlikely. Secondly, regarding condition (b), the selection of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election is a more straightforward process. As the incumbent president of the Republican Party, Trump has a strong chance of being nominated by the Republican National Convention. However, the nomination process can be influenced by various factors, including the outcome of primary elections and the preferences of party delegates.

However, it's also essential to consider the unpredictability of the Olympics. The performance of athletes can vary greatly from one Olympics to another, and external factors such as team dynamics, coaching, and the presence of talented athletes can influence the outcome. Additionally, the Paris 2024 Olympics will feature new events, which can impact the medal count. Another factor to consider is the global competition.

Firstly, the Republican primary is highly competitive, with multiple candidates vying for the nomination. Historically, the Republican Party has favored more conservative candidates, and both Suarez and Haley have been identified as potential contenders. However, their chances of securing the nomination depend on various factors, including their campaign strategies, fundraising abilities, and the support they receive from party delegates. Francis Suarez, the current mayor of Miami, has gained attention for his conservative views and his ability to appeal to a broad range of voters. He has been endorsed by prominent Republicans and has a strong online presence. However, his lack of national experience and limited name recognition may hinder his ability to secure the nomination. Nikki Haley, on the other hand, has a stronger national profile, having served as the Governor of South Carolina and as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. She has a reputation for being a strong conservative and has been endorsed by several prominent Republicans. However, her past criticisms of former President Trump may make it challenging for her to secure the nomination, given the party's current dynamics. Given these factors, it's unlikely that both Suarez and Haley will secure the nomination. The Republican primary is often a zero-sum game, where one candidate's gain is another's loss. It's possible that one of them may emerge as a strong contender, but it's less likely that both will secure the nomination. However, it's also worth noting that the Republican National Convention is a complex process, and the outcome is difficult to predict.

Given the lack of information about the current status of the market and the political context, I will rely on my general knowledge about the US political system. In general, it is unlikely that 10 or more Democratic Senators will call for a presidential candidate to drop out, as this would be a significant blow to the party's unity and chances of winning the election.

If the INC performs well and wins a significant number of seats, it may be able to form a government with the support of other parties. However, if the INC performs poorly, it may struggle to form a government, even with the support of other parties. Another factor that could influence the outcome is the leadership of the INC.

The BJP has been in power at the center since 2014 and has a significant presence in several states. However, the INC has a strong presence in several key states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra. The BJP's chances of forming the government depend on their performance in these key states, as well as their ability to win a majority of the Lok Sabha seats. The BJP has been working to expand its base and has been actively campaigning in several states. However, the INC has also been working to regain its lost ground and has been making efforts to strengthen its base in key states. Another factor that could influence the outcome is the impact of regional parties, such as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Trinamool Congress (TMC), and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), which have been gaining popularity in recent years. These parties could potentially play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election, especially in the states where they have a strong presence. Additionally, the performance of the incumbent government and the economic situation in the country could also impact the outcome of the election.

However, without real-time data or a clear indication of the current number of Senators who have called for Biden to drop out, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

Firstly, we need to evaluate the likelihood of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20. To do this, we can consider the current dynamics of the Democratic party and the presidential election. As of my knowledge cutoff, the situation is fluid, and it's challenging to predict with certainty. However, we can look at the current situation: Biden has been facing pressure from various quarters, including some Democratic Senators, but the number of Senators calling for him to drop out is not yet at 10. The link provided in the resolution source suggests that we need to monitor the current situation, and if 10 or more Senators call for Biden to drop out before July 20, the outcome will be 'yes.' Given the current context, I would estimate the probability of this happening as relatively low, around 20%, as it would require a significant shift in the dynamics of the party and the election. Secondly, we need to evaluate the likelihood of there being another Democratic party presidential debate. Presidential debates are often a significant part of the election process, and they typically occur when there is a crowded field of candidates. While there are several potential Democratic nominees, the current field is not as crowded as it was in previous elections. However, it's still possible that additional debates could be held, especially if there are significant changes in the polls or if new candidates enter the race. I would estimate the probability of another debate occurring before the 2024 Democratic National Convention as around 40%, as it's a plausible scenario given the current state of the election. Considering these two conditions, we can combine their probabilities to estimate the overall probability of the question resolving to 'yes.' Since the two conditions are not mutually exclusive, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

First, let's consider the availability of ChatGPT in the EU. OpenAI has not publicly announced any specific timeline for the EU launch, but they have expressed interest in expanding their services to the region. Given the EU's strict data protection regulations, it's possible that OpenAI may need to comply with these regulations, which could delay the launch. However, OpenAI has been working with regulators to ensure compliance, and it's likely that they will meet the necessary requirements. Considering these factors, I assign a moderate probability to the event of ChatGPT being generally available in the EU by June 30, 2024. Next, let's consider the market having at least 377 traders by July 15, 2024. The market is currently tracking the number of traders, and the current count is below the target. The growth rate of the market is relatively slow, and it's uncertain whether it will reach the target within the given timeframe. However, the market is still active, and it's possible that the number of traders will increase in the coming weeks. I assign a lower probability to this event, as it's less certain. Combining these two events, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to estimate the probability of either event occurring. The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities, while the probability of either event occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring. Assuming the probability of ChatGPT being generally available in the EU by June 30, 2024, is 0.6, and the probability of the market having at least 377 traders by July 15, 2024, is 0.2, we can calculate the probability of either event occurring as follows: P(either event) = P(ChatGPT available in EU) + P(market has at least 377 traders) - P(both events) = 0.6 + 0.2 - (0.6 * 0.2) = 0.64."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.019028633036963116, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.004757158259240779, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.19977891384702753, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, without access to the most recent and specific information on Ireland's Eurovision 2024 plans, we can't be certain. Ireland's national broadcaster, RT\u00c9, typically selects the country's Eurovision entry through an internal selection process or an open call for submissions.

In the past few years, Ireland has qualified for the Grand Final every time it participated, which suggests a strong chance of qualification. However, it's essential to note that the competition is highly unpredictable, and a single year's performance does not guarantee future success.

Luxembourg's performance in the Eurovision competition has been less consistent compared to Ireland.

The key to resolving this question lies in the willingness of named Democratic Party US House Members or US Senators to take a public stance against President Biden and the likelihood that President Biden will publicly relinquish his nomination. Since President Biden has already secured the Democratic nomination and it is generally uncommon for high-ranking party officials to go against the party's nomination, the likelihood of named Democratic Party US House Members or US Senators publicly pushing President Biden to drop out is low. Additionally, given President Biden's recent campaign and public statements about his candidacy, it seems unlikely that he will voluntarily relinquish his nomination without significant pressure from his own party. Given this information, the likelihood that both conditions will be met is very low. I consider it more likely that one of the conditions may be met, but for the question to resolve YES, both conditions need to be met, making it even more unlikely.

First, we look at the condition that Kamala's odds of winning increase according to Nate Silver's model. This requires the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model to be >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM. Without access to Nate Silver's model, we can't directly assess the likelihood of this condition being met. However, we can consider the broader context and available information. Nate Silver's model is known for its accuracy and is widely followed for its election predictions. If there is any significant change in the polls or other factors that would suggest an increase in Kamala's odds of winning, it's likely that Nate Silver's model would reflect this change. Given the time frame of a week, it's possible that there could be some fluctuations in the polls, but it's difficult to predict with certainty whether this would be enough to increase Kamala's odds of winning according to Nate Silver's model. The second condition is that the 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee will be a Woman. This is a more general statement and is not directly tied to Nate Silver's model. However, we can consider the current field of Democratic candidates and the likelihood of a woman being nominated. While there are several women running for the Democratic nomination, it's difficult to predict with certainty which candidate will ultimately be nominated. However, given the trend towards increasing representation of women in politics and the Democratic Party's efforts to promote diversity and inclusion, it's possible that a woman could be nominated. Considering these two conditions, we can estimate the probability that either condition is met. Since we can't directly assess the likelihood of the first condition being met, we'll focus on the second condition. Given the current field of candidates and the trend towards increasing representation of women in politics, I would estimate the probability that the 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee will be a Woman as around 30-40%. This is a rough estimate and is based on general trends and available information. However, the question asks for the probability that either condition is met. Since the two conditions are not mutually exclusive, we need to consider the overlap between them. If Kamala's odds of winning increase according to Nate Silver's model, it's possible that she could be nominated as the Democratic Presidential Nominee. However, this is not a guarantee, and there are other factors that could influence the nomination process. Given the uncertainty surrounding the first condition, we can't directly estimate the probability of the overlap between the two conditions. However, we can consider the probability of the second condition being met and then add a small probability to account for the possibility that Kamala's odds of winning increase according to Nate Silver's model. Taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the first condition and the trend towards increasing representation of women in politics, I would estimate the probability that either condition is met as around 40-50%.

Historically, the Democratic Party has had several female presidential nominees, including Hillary Clinton in 2016. However, the party's nominee is typically chosen through a complex process involving primaries and caucuses, which can be influenced by various factors such as candidate popularity, fundraising, and endorsements.

Firstly, let's consider the event of Joe Biden's death before Saturday. Joe Biden is 81 years old, and while he is in good health, the risk of death increases with age. However, without access to real-time health information, it's challenging to estimate the exact probability of his death. Assuming a neutral prior, we might assign a probability of around 0.1% to 1% for Joe Biden's death before Saturday, given his age and health status. Next, let's consider the probability of a woman being nominated as the 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee. The Democratic Party has a diverse pool of potential candidates, and several women have expressed interest in running for the nomination. However, the nomination process is highly unpredictable, and the outcome depends on various factors, including the candidates' popularity, fundraising abilities, and the party's base. While it's difficult to predict the outcome, we can look at historical data and trends. In the 2020 Democratic primary, several women ran for the nomination, including Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Tulsi Gabbard. Although none of them won the nomination, they performed relatively well in the early stages of the campaign. Given the current landscape, it's possible that a woman could emerge as a strong contender for the 2024 nomination. However, without more information about the specific candidates and their chances, it's challenging to estimate the probability. As a rough estimate, let's assign a probability of around 20% to 30% for a woman being nominated as the 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee. Now, to estimate the probability that either of the two events will occur, we can use the union rule for probability, which states that the probability of the union of two events is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of their intersection. In this case, the probability of either event occurring is approximately equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring, minus the probability of both events occurring. Let's assume that the probability of both events occurring is negligible, as they are relatively independent. Therefore, the probability that either of the two events will occur is approximately equal to 0.1% + 25% = 25.1%.

Since the exact rules and constraints of his current or planned actions are uncertain, any attempt to directly calculate probabilities based on readily available public information appears unsuitable for an effective result. A few assumptions we might entertain could have varied potential. One: Perhaps President Biden might continue and try his luck, sticking to past intentions as part of any larger overall, future-minded, comprehensive or, to a significant point, strategically considered election game or politics plan to help bring along or boost various allies with shared viewpoints during that coming cycle for various causes including party platform that also fits into ongoing strategic aims across all elections under party brand, this possibly based or founded at length or fully upon several very solid principles or strategic underpinnings already implemented under Democratic party rule under that previous election campaign when then VP Biden successfully launched himself upon that initial nationwide primary ballot to reach for nomination of party for first run as the President. On the other hand, possibly Joe Biden may indeed wish to avoid the pressure, stress, and costs of a prolonged campaign. Therefore, it might indeed, with this consideration make logical and therefore possible his preference of retirement and backing new fresh alternatives with perhaps already being familiar to be best prepared through an official message on party platform so many know very well through and which should bring no big shocks if any announcements. These various potential motives along the possibilities may cause President Joe to consider all relevant possibilities based on some solid past campaign successes where any big issues have turned really strong supporters of many campaigns by and for then potential nominee at the last few steps on way into first elections so, now maybe very valuable, new voices added can now reach big change now and thus lead by doing a smart alternative approach when looking around current events today, when Joe makes new, bigger better plan all of those already existing great things about very first day when really looking up really at now best first 4 weeks start from any campaign trail very smart or smart plan first by having good news shared now also at now starting in spring time this big now campaign to very real future real first president choice that we, therefore need here. A great challenge also arises by reason that such public figure cannot reveal details on campaign unless or unless such may directly harm such persons interests including many campaign team in big politics because this politics at many a times not known but when many or perhaps several factors at very play this situation then will then happen but will take in much larger view this great politician because now have come big choice time before a election to a position like of a high ranked member from this the leading parties this great USA like all people so for some will wish and this some and have many others reasons, including those at high ranked but with high sense for those very difficult many years this also some difficult some will and are but in difficult. All other considerations notwithstanding for Joe's future steps before he's a sure political or possibly future USA Democratic Presidential campaign nominee - considering and to a higher than most - even including possible various potential - his strong preference to, but he very likely must think to really take one that should at final in July of that summer time period before many elections when at least most may start running their official primary ballot nominations in year as before they get out then but can only at July at any of any first - with any good strategy but one he already would really try for as if one possible that makes perfect most better also makes some or some in new party better too when his one for party really the last great leader after winning with most and to end but may wish with such, after winning also will and always, when, like and now also as then too as the real true one best leader ever elected USA - so very really also so that makes Joe to want to choose what's best for the future of party and of America too so that when his term will end but many of the great leaders have to decide on whether or not to run for election and some may decide not to run for election as a great leader."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "98cbc458-e70e-43b6-9f76-6e4e6f3e48cd", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Russia have control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024 and (b) Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve as **Yes** if, when accessed by Metaculus on June 1, 2024, the [Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375) shows the coordinates 48\u00b035'13.7\"N 37\u00b050'02.1\"E as under any of the following categories:\n\n- Assessed Russian Advance in Ukraine\n- Assessed Russian Gains in the Past 24 Hours\n- Assessed Russian Control\n- Claimed Russian Territory in Ukraine\n- Any other categories created by ISW that indicate Russian control of the location\n\nThe question will resolve as **No** if the location is not assessed to be in any of the categories indicating Russian control, which includes but is not limited to:\n\n- Reported Ukrainian Territorial Gains in the Past 24 Hours\n- Claimed Ukrainian Counteroffensives\n- Reported Ukrainian Partisan Warfare\n- Any other categories created by ISW that indicate Ukrainian control of the location or a lack of Russian control of the location.\n\n(b) This question will resolve as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.\n\nTo qualify for a Yes resolution, the statement must be unambiguous and conclusive: it should leave no room for the possibility that Biden would accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nIf such a definitive statement is not made prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, this question will resolve as No.\n\nFine print and additional background information can be found on Metaculus.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-15T10:11:26Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-25T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.04, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To determine the probability of both events occurring, we need to evaluate the likelihood of each event separately and then consider their independence.

Event (a): Vivek Ramaswamy becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This event is highly dependent on the preferences of the Republican delegates attending the national convention. While Vivek Ramaswamy is a prominent figure in the Republican Party, his chances of becoming the nominee are relatively low compared to other prominent candidates like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. However, it's difficult to predict the outcome of the convention with certainty, and there is always a possibility of an underdog candidate emerging as the nominee. Event (b): Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024. This event is more uncertain and depends on the outcome of the ongoing investigations into Donald Trump's activities. While there have been numerous investigations and indictments against Donald Trump in recent years, the specific charge of witness tampering in Georgia is a possibility, but not a certainty.

His team has not made any such public declaration, and this lack of clarity suggests a low likelihood of a clear announcement before July 15, 2024. 2. Recent news and statements: In recent news, Joe Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election, which doesn't suggest any immediate announcement of retirement. His repeated statements on his desire to run again have not had any clear caveats on accepting the nomination. 3. Potential for party pressure: While there have been some calls for his retirement from certain quarters of the Democratic Party, there is no indication that these calls have become so strong that they will lead to a public declaration of retirement from Joe Biden. 4. Likelihood of an announcement from his campaign: Given the points above, it seems unlikely that Joe Biden's campaign will make a definitive, public, official announcement stating that he will not run for re-election before the deadline. 5. The deadline itself: As the deadline is July 15, 2024, there is still more than six months left in the year, which seems to be a long period for such an announcement considering the points above.

While there have been instances of Democratic lawmakers expressing concerns about Biden's re-election prospects, it's unclear whether a group of at least 5 would come together to pressure him to drop out. This event is more uncertain and less likely than Event (a). Considering the joint probability of both events, we need to think about the intersection of these two events. If the EU were to announce tariffs or duties on Chinese electric vehicles, it's possible that this could create a sense of urgency or crisis among Democratic lawmakers, potentially leading them to pressure Biden to drop out.

First, regarding the polling average, I will rely on historical data from 538's national polling average.

However, based on the historical data, I can estimate the likelihood of Trump's lead being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024. Historical data suggests that Trump's lead over Biden has fluctuated between a low of -10.4 (Biden leading by 10.4 points) and a high of 3.8 (Trump leading by 3.8 points).

Firstly, let's consider the probability of Trump's lead being between 2 and 3 points on July 15, 2024. Since the question is asking about a specific snapshot of the polling average on a particular date, we can consider this as a binary event where either the condition is met or it is not. The probability of this event is difficult to estimate without access to current polling data, but we can assume that it is not extremely low since polling averages can fluctuate. Secondly, let's consider the probability of Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President. This event is more speculative and dependent on various factors such as Biden's health, his campaign's strategy, and potential internal conflicts within the Democratic Party. However, it is also a relatively rare event, and we can assume that the probability of it happening is low. Given these considerations, we can estimate the probability of either event occurring. Since these events are not mutually exclusive, we need to consider the probability of both events occurring. However, since the events are relatively independent, we can assume that the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

Firstly, the Republican Party has a history of favoring experienced politicians, and the Trump family members, except for Donald Trump, lack significant political experience. This suggests that their chances of becoming the nominee might be lower compared to more experienced politicians. However, the Republican Party is known for its populist and divisive politics, which Donald Trump has leveraged to his advantage in the past. The party's base remains loyal to Trump, and he has a strong following among conservative voters. Additionally, the Republican Party is likely to be split in 2024, with some factions supporting Trump and others likely to back more moderate candidates. This division could create an opportunity for a Trump family member to capitalize on the party's internal divisions. Furthermore, the 2024 Republican primary field is uncertain, and it's difficult to predict which candidates will run and their chances of success.

First, regarding Joe Biden's announcement, it's essential to consider his past statements and actions. In 2020, he announced his candidacy for the presidency, and since then, he has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. However, there have been instances where he has hinted at the possibility of not running, such as during the 2022 midterms. Nevertheless, these instances were short-lived, and he has since reaffirmed his commitment to running. Given the current context, it's unlikely that Joe Biden will announce his non-candidacy before July 15, 2024. His campaign has been actively preparing for the 2024 election, and there is no indication that he is planning to step down. Therefore, I assign a low probability to this part of the question resolving as 'Yes'. Next, regarding the probability of a Trump family member becoming the Republican nominee, it's essential to consider the current state of the Republican Party and the potential candidates. While Donald Trump has been mentioned as a potential candidate, it's unclear whether he will run again. If he does, he will likely face significant opposition from other Republican candidates. Additionally, there are other Trump family members who could potentially run, such as Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Tiffany Trump, Melania Trump, or Barron Trump. However, it's uncertain whether any of them will decide to run. Given the current context, I assign a moderate probability to this part of the question resolving as 'Yes'. While it's possible that a Trump family member could become the Republican nominee, it's not a certainty. Considering both parts of the question, I assign a low probability to the entire question resolving as 'Yes'."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "fe739a95-19aa-496a-9840-37c8978653a7", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President, (b) A member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) Before 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement that he will not seek and will not accept the nomination of the Democratic Party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.

Firstly, regarding event (a), Joe Biden has not shown any clear indication of not seeking re-election. In fact, he has expressed his intention to run for re-election. However, it's possible that he might change his mind or face unforeseen circumstances that could lead to him announcing his withdrawal. Given the current context, I consider this scenario to be relatively unlikely, but not impossible. Secondly, regarding event (b), the Republican primary field is still open, and several candidates have announced their intention to run. While Donald Trump has hinted at running, it's uncertain whether he will ultimately decide to do so. The other Trump family members have not shown significant interest in running, but it's not entirely impossible that one of them could enter the race. However, the Republican Party typically favors more established politicians, and it's unclear whether a Trump family member would be a strong contender. Considering these factors, I assess the likelihood of event (a) as relatively low, around 5-10%, due to Joe Biden's current intentions and the stability of his campaign. For event (b), I estimate the probability as around 20-30%, as while it's possible, it's not the most likely scenario given the Republican primary landscape. However, since the question asks for the probability of either event occurring, I need to combine these estimates.

First, let's consider condition (a). Biden's presidency is subject to various factors, including his health, potential scandals, and political opposition. However, there is no clear indication that he will resign or be removed from office before the end of July 2024. In fact, he has not shown any signs of weakness or instability that would suggest his removal. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Biden remaining President through the end of July 2024 as high, around 0.9. Next, let's consider condition (b). The likelihood of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is more uncertain. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding public office. Trump's actions and rhetoric surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot have been widely criticized, and some legal experts argue that he may be subject to this provision. However, the process of removing or blocking a candidate from the ballot is complex and subject to various legal challenges. While it is possible that Trump may face challenges, it is also possible that these efforts may be unsuccessful or delayed. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as moderate, around 0.4. Since the two conditions are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to estimate the probability that both will occur. Therefore, the probability that both conditions will occur is 0.9 x 0.4 = 0.36."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "e0bc2770-af8d-4e0e-9327-aa9e4bf96d05", "title": "Will either Biden remain President through July 2024 or Trump be removed from any primary election ballot under the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves YES if either of the following occurs: (a) Biden remains US President through the end of July 2024 (ET); resolves NO if he resigns, dies, or otherwise ceases to be President before then.

Firstly, considering condition (a), it is crucial to note that the President's term is set to end on January 20, 2025, and the question specifies that Biden must remain in office through the end of July 2024. This means that the President's term would have to be extended or Biden would need to remain in office beyond the scheduled end of his term. However, there is no indication that the term will be extended, and it is unlikely that Biden would remain in office beyond the scheduled end of his term. Therefore, the likelihood of condition (a) being met is low. Now, let's consider condition (b). The removal of Trump from any primary election ballot under the 14th Amendment would require a significant political and legal process. While it's possible that some states may attempt to remove Trump, it's uncertain whether they would be successful, especially given the potential for legal challenges and appeals. However, it's also worth noting that some states have already taken steps to disqualify Trump from their primary ballots, and it's possible that more states may follow suit. Therefore, while the likelihood of Trump being removed from all primary election ballots is low, it's not impossible. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of either condition (a) or condition (b) being met as follows: As of now, there are 50 states in the US, and it is uncertain how many of them will remove Trump from the ballot. However, some states have already taken steps to disqualify him. Let's assume that 5 states will remove him from the ballot. This is a rough estimate and may not reflect the actual number. The probability of condition (b) being met is the probability that 5 or more states remove Trump from the ballot. This can be modeled as a binomial distribution with n=50 (number of states) and p=0.1 (probability of a state removing Trump from the ballot). Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability of 5 or more states removing Trump from the ballot. The probability of condition (a) being met is the probability that Biden remains in office through July 2024. This is a difficult event to estimate, as it would require Biden to remain in office beyond the scheduled end of his term. However, given the current political climate and the fact that there is no indication that Biden plans to resign or be removed, I would estimate the probability of condition (a) being met as low. Using these estimates, I would calculate the probability of either condition (a) or condition (b) being met as the sum of the probabilities of each condition being met."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04613943067560733, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.011534857668901832, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3107723875462025, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, regarding condition (a), Kamala Harris becoming President or Acting President before July 26, 2024, I consider the following points: The US Constitution's 25th Amendment provides for the Vice President to assume the presidency if the President is unable to discharge the duties of the office. Kamala Harris has been Vice President since 2021, and there have been no significant events or health issues that would have led to her assuming the presidency. However, it's possible that a future event, such as the President's incapacitation or resignation, could lead to Harris becoming Acting President. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of Kamala Harris becoming President or Acting President before July 26, 2024, as relatively low, around 5%. Next, regarding condition (b), a member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, I consider the following points: Donald Trump, the former President, has already announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. While other members of the Trump family, such as Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump, have been involved in politics, there is no indication that they will run for the presidency in 2024. Melania Trump and Barron Trump have not been involved in politics, and it's unlikely that they would run for the presidency. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of a member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 as relatively high, around 80%. Now, considering both conditions, I estimate the probability of both occurring as the product of the individual probabilities, which is approximately 0.05 * 0.8 = 0.04."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "62e17da4-1926-4583-a4fe-a78c494bc749", "title": "Will either Kamala Harris become President by Friday or a Trump family member be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?", "body": "This question resolves to \"Yes\" if either of the following occurs:\n\n1.

This can happen if she is formally designated as President or Acting President at any point before July 26, 2024, 11:59 PM ET. The primary source of information for this will be official government announcements, but a consensus of credible reporting will also be considered. Given the current political climate and the fact that Harris is the current Vice President, it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of her becoming President by Friday without more information. However, considering the relatively short timeframe, it's unlikely that she would be designated as President or Acting President before July 26, 2024. Therefore, I assign a low probability to this scenario. Secondly, let's consider the likelihood of a Trump family member being the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. The Trump family members in question are Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Tiffany Trump, Melania Trump, and Barron Trump. While it's possible that one of them could become the Republican nominee, the likelihood depends on various factors such as their political ambitions, the Republican Party's primary process, and the general election landscape.

However, it's also possible that Czechia could receive strong support from the Czech fanbase, which could lead to an upset. In the absence of specific data on Czechia's Eurovision prospects, I will rely on general trends in the competition. Typically, around 10 countries from each Semi-final qualify for the Grand Final, but this can vary from year to year. Considering this, the probability of Czechia qualifying for the Grand Final, given that it participates in a Semi-final, would be around 20% to 30%. I will take the midpoint of this range and assign a probability of 25%."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "439091c4-b9d1-4944-a33e-dc72a2c10ca4", "title": "Will Georgia qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Georgia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

The information provided mentions that she will be participating in the Women's 100m and the Women's 4x100m Relay. Firstly, let's look at the Women's 100m event. Sha'Carri Richardson is a strong contender in this event, having set multiple world records in the past. However, the Olympic Games are known for being highly competitive, and there are many talented athletes who will be vying for the top spot. Given her past performances, I would estimate her chances of winning the gold medal in the Women's 100m event to be around 20-30%. Next, let's consider the Women's 4x100m Relay event. In this event, the outcome is highly dependent on the team's performance, and it's difficult to predict the chances of winning. However, if Sha'Carri Richardson is part of a strong team, her chances of winning a gold medal in this event could be higher. Let's assume a 10-20% chance of winning the gold medal in the relay event. To estimate the overall probability of Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, we need to consider both events. Assuming that her chances of winning the gold medal in the Women's 100m event and the Women's 4x100m Relay event are independent, we can calculate the overall probability by adding the probabilities of winning each event. This gives us a total probability of around 30-50%. However, we need to consider that the question asks for the probability of Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal in any event. This means that we need to consider the probability of her winning a gold medal in either the Women's 100m or the Women's 4x100m Relay event. Using the formula for the union of two events, we can calculate this probability as follows: P(gold medal) = P(gold medal in 100m) + P(gold medal in relay) - P(gold medal in both). Assuming that the probability of winning a gold medal in both events is very low (less than 1%), we can simplify the formula to: P(gold medal) = P(gold medal in 100m) + P(gold medal in relay). Using the estimates above, we get: P(gold medal) = 30-50% + 10-20% = 40-70%.

First, let's consider the probability of Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal. Richardson is a world-class sprinter and has a strong track record, having won several national and international titles. She has also shown impressive performances in recent years, including a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. While she faces stiff competition in the women's 100m and 4x100m relay events, her skills and experience give her a decent chance of winning a gold medal. However, it's essential to consider that the Olympic Games are a high-pressure event, and many factors can influence an athlete's performance, such as injuries, weather conditions, and mental preparation.

Next, let's consider the probability of France placing in the top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics. France has a strong athletic program and has consistently performed well in the Olympic Games, winning multiple medals in various events.

Since the two events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities to estimate the probability of both events occurring.

Sha'Carri Richardson's chances of winning a gold medal: As a world-class sprinter, Sha'Carri Richardson has a good chance of winning a gold medal in the Women's 100m event, where she will compete. However, the competition will be fierce, and there are many other talented athletes who could also win gold. I'll assume that her chances of winning gold in the Women's 100m event are around 20-30% (this is a rough estimate, as I don't have more specific information about her chances). 2. Sha'Carri Richardson's chances of winning a gold medal in the Women's 4x100m Relay: If Sha'Carri Richardson is selected for the Women's 4x100m Relay team, her chances of winning gold in this event will depend on the performance of her teammates. Assuming that the team is strong and well-trained, I'll estimate her chances of winning gold in this event as around 10-20%. 3. France's chances of placing in the top 5 in the medal table: To estimate France's chances of placing in the top 5, I'll consider the country's past performance in the Olympics, as well as the strength of their teams in various events. France has a strong track record in the Olympics, and they have a good chance of winning medals in several events. However, the competition will be intense, and there are many other strong teams that could also place in the top 5. I'll estimate France's chances of placing in the top 5 as around 30-40%. 4. Independence of the events: The two events (Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal and France placing in the top 5) are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the other. Considering these factors, I'll estimate the probability that either Sha'Carri Richardson wins a gold medal or France places in the top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics as follows: - Probability of Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal in the Women's 100m event: 25% (midpoint of 20-30%) - Probability of Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal in the Women's 4x100m Relay: 15% (midpoint of 10-20%) - Probability of France placing in the top 5 in the medal table: 35% (midpoint of 30-40%) To calculate the overall probability, I'll use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Given the competitive nature of the Democratic primary, it's likely that multiple candidates will emerge, increasing the likelihood of debates. Secondly, the Democratic Party has a history of holding debates, with the most recent one being in 2020. Although the exact format and timing may change, it's reasonable to assume that the party will continue this tradition. Thirdly, the 2024 Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in July or August 2024. This leaves sufficient time for debates to occur, considering the primary process typically begins in the spring of 2024. However, there are some factors that could impact the likelihood of debates. The party may choose to modify the debate format or reduce the number of debates due to concerns about the 2024 election cycle being particularly contentious or to minimize the impact of debates on the campaign.

The 2024 Democratic National Convention is a significant event, and it's likely that there will be debates between potential Democratic nominees prior to the convention. In fact, debates are a crucial part of the presidential nomination process, and they often occur in the months leading up to the convention.

Next, let's consider the probability that a reliable media outlet will cover Joe Biden's dropout story at least 6 hours in advance if he were to drop out. This event is more uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as the timing of Biden's dropout, the media outlet's reporting schedule, and the availability of information.

If there are multiple candidates with a significant chance of winning, it's likely that the party will hold debates to allow voters to compare their positions and policies. Additionally, debates can help to clarify the candidates' stances on key issues, which can be beneficial for the party's chances in the general election. However, if the current field of candidates is relatively weak or if one candidate is significantly ahead in the polls, it's possible that the party may not hold additional debates.

First, let's consider the participation of Czechia. Czechia has participated in Eurovision several times in the past, but its performance has been inconsistent. However, the country has a dedicated fan base and has shown improvement in recent years. Given this, I would estimate the probability of Czechia participating in a Semi-final as around 0.8 (80%). Next, let's consider the qualification of Czechia. Assuming Czechia participates in a Semi-final, the probability of it being officially announced as qualified by the EBU is difficult to estimate without more information. However, considering the general trends in Eurovision, I would estimate the probability of Czechia qualifying as around 0.2 (20%). Now, let's consider the participation and qualification of Georgia. Georgia has also participated in Eurovision several times in the past and has shown a strong performance in recent years. Given this, I would estimate the probability of Georgia participating in a Semi-final as around 0.9 (90%). Similarly, assuming Georgia participates in a Semi-final, the probability of it being officially announced as qualified by the EBU is also difficult to estimate without more information. However, considering the general trends in Eurovision, I would estimate the probability of Georgia qualifying as around 0.3 (30%). Since the question asks for the probability that either Czechia or Georgia will qualify for the Grand Final, we need to consider the probability of at least one of them qualifying. This can be calculated using the formula: P(at least one) = 1 - P(neither). Using the probabilities estimated above, we can calculate the probability of neither Czechia nor Georgia qualifying as follows: P(neither) = (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.9) * (1 - 0.2) * (1 - 0.3) = 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.0016.

Historically, the Republicans Party and the National Rally have had a complex relationship, with periods of cooperation and conflict. However, in recent years, there have been increasing signs of rapprochement between the two parties. In 2022, the leader of the Republicans Party, Christian Jacob, met with the leader of the National Rally, Marine Le Pen, to discuss potential cooperation. Moreover, the 2024 French legislative election is expected to be a highly competitive and unpredictable event, with many parties and coalitions vying for power. In this context, an alliance between the Republicans Party and the National Rally could be a strategic move to increase their chances of winning seats in the National Assembly. However, there are also reasons to be cautious about the likelihood of this alliance forming. The Republicans Party has traditionally been seen as a more moderate and centrist force in French politics, while the National Rally has been associated with more extreme and nationalist views. This ideological divide could make it difficult for the two parties to come to an agreement on key issues. Additionally, the timeline for forming an alliance is relatively short, with only a few months remaining before the election. This could create pressure and tension between the parties as they negotiate the terms of their agreement.

Firstly, let's consider the possibility of Ted Cruz being the Republican nominee. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of the Republican primary with certainty, the current field of candidates is large and diverse, and Cruz has a strong track record as a politician. However, the Republican National Convention is still a long way off, and many factors can influence the outcome. I would estimate the probability of Ted Cruz being the Republican nominee as around 0.2, as there are many other strong contenders and the primary process is inherently unpredictable. Next, let's consider the possibility of Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President. As of now, Joe Biden has not made any public statements indicating that he will not seek re-election, and it's unlikely that he would make such an announcement this far in advance. However, it's also possible that Biden may change his mind or face unexpected challenges within his party that could lead to a change in his plans. I would estimate the probability of Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024, as around 0.1, as there is no clear indication that he plans to step down.

The Republican National Convention typically takes place in late summer, and the delegates' selection process is often unpredictable. While Ted Cruz is a prominent figure in the Republican Party, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether he will be selected as the nominee. However, given his past performances in Republican primaries and his current popularity within the party, I would estimate the probability of him being the nominee at around 20-30%. Next, let's consider the probability of Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President. Joe Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election, and it's unlikely that he will change his mind and withdraw from the race. However, it's possible that he may face challenges or controversies that could lead him to reconsider his candidacy. Given the current political landscape and Biden's popularity within the Democratic Party, I would estimate the probability of him announcing his withdrawal before July 15, 2024 at around 10-20%. Since these events are mutually exclusive (i.e., Ted Cruz being the nominee and Joe Biden announcing his withdrawal are not both possible at the same time), we can add the probabilities of each event occurring to get the overall probability.

Firstly, the market has already received some attention and engagement, as indicated by the existence of a community for it, suggesting that it has some level of interest. However, the current number of traders is not provided in the question, making it difficult to assess the likelihood of reaching 377 traders in just over a week. Additionally, the time frame is relatively short, which might limit the potential for significant growth. On the other hand, the market's topic might be of interest to a dedicated group of people, potentially leading to a surge in participation. However, without further information about the market's current state, engagement patterns, or the characteristics of its target audience, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction. Therefore, I'll rely on general assumptions and available data on market growth patterns. Typically, market growth follows an S-curve, with an initial slow growth phase, followed by an exponential increase as more people become aware of the market. However, this growth is often influenced by various factors such as marketing efforts, community engagement, and the market's relevance to the audience. Given the short time frame and the lack of specific information about the market's current state and growth rate, I'll consider a moderate growth scenario, assuming that the market will gain some traction but not reach extremely high levels in a short period. Reasonable growth rates for such markets can be around 10-20% per day, which is a relatively optimistic assumption. However, this is a very rough estimate and actual growth rates can be much lower or higher depending on the specifics of the market.

However, his popularity has waxed and waned over the years, and he has been critical of former President Trump, which may impact his chances of gaining the nomination. Another key factor is the current field of candidates and the dynamics of the 2024 Republican primary. The Republican Party has a diverse range of potential candidates, including Donald Trump, who is a strong contender and has a significant following. The nomination process will likely involve a complex interplay between various factors, including the candidates' policies, debate performances, fundraising abilities, and grassroots support. Additionally, the Republican National Convention's delegate selection process will play a significant role in determining the nominee. The convention is typically attended by delegates who are elected or appointed by the states, and their votes can be influenced by a variety of factors, including their state's primary or caucus results, party loyalty, and personal relationships with the candidates.

While he is a well-known figure in the Republican Party, he has not yet secured a significant lead in the polls or endorsements from key party leaders. The Republican nomination process is highly competitive, and many other candidates, such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley, are also vying for the nomination.

For event (a), the probability of the Month-over-Month US Core CPI increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024 is difficult to estimate without access to current and future economic data. However, we can look at historical trends and the current economic climate to make an educated guess. The US Core CPI has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with some fluctuations. Given the current inflationary pressures and the likelihood of further interest rate hikes, it's possible that the Core CPI could increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024.

Firstly, let's consider the probability of the US Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July. The Core CPI is a measure of inflation that excludes food and energy prices, and it's influenced by various economic factors such as monetary policy, employment rates, and consumer spending. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, we can look at historical trends and current economic indicators. The US economy has been experiencing a moderate growth rate, and inflation has been relatively stable.

The SENSEX has fluctuated significantly, and predicting its exact value on a specific date several months in advance is highly uncertain. For event (b), the question is about the number of traders on a specific market on a particular date. This event is more predictable, as it depends on the number of people who visit and participate in the market between now and July 15.

The number of traders can be influenced by a variety of factors including market conditions, the time of year, and the level of interest in the market.

First, let's consider condition (a). Joe Biden has not publicly announced his intention to drop out of the presidential race. While it's possible that he might withdraw, it's uncertain and speculative at this point. Historically, presidential candidates rarely drop out before the primary season is over. However, the Democratic primary has not yet begun, and Biden's campaign has not gained significant traction. Considering these factors, I assign a probability of 0.1 to condition (a) resolving as 'Yes'. Next, let's consider condition (b). Donald Trump's eligibility for the 2024 presidential election is a contentious issue, with some states considering disqualifying him under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. While there have been legal challenges and debates, it's uncertain whether any state will officially remove or block him from the ballot by July 15. Some states may take action, but others might not.

The question states that they need to participate in a Semi-final and be officially announced by the EBU as having qualified for the Grand Final. While there is no information provided about the specific Semi-finals that Georgia and Estonia will participate in, we can infer that the qualification process is competitive and random, as the EBU does not provide any information about the qualification criteria or the number of spots available for each Semi-final. However, we can look at past patterns of Eurovision Semi-finals. Typically, each Semi-final has around 18-20 countries competing, and 10 countries qualify for the Grand Final from each Semi-final. Given that there are two Semi-finals, and assuming that the number of participating countries will be similar to previous years, we can estimate the probability of Georgia and Estonia qualifying for the Grand Final. Assuming that Georgia and Estonia are randomly distributed among the participating countries, we can estimate the probability of both countries qualifying as follows: The probability of Georgia qualifying is approximately 10/20 (assuming 20 countries in a Semi-final and 10 spots available). The probability of Estonia qualifying given that Georgia has qualified is approximately 9/19 (assuming 19 countries remaining and 9 spots available).

The Kalenjin people have a high representation in distance running, particularly in Kenya, and have produced many successful marathon runners. However, the success of Kalenjin athletes is not solely determined by their ethnicity, and other factors such as training, dedication, and competition can influence the outcome. Given the global pool of talented marathon runners, it's challenging to estimate the exact probability of Kalenjin athletes winning both races.

Secondly, for condition (b), we need to evaluate the possibility of a swimmer winning the most gold medals. Swimming is a highly competitive sport with a large pool of talented athletes worldwide. While it's possible for a swimmer to excel and win multiple gold medals, it's also likely that other athletes from different sports, such as gymnastics, athletics, or water polo, could achieve similar success.

For event (a), Joe Biden's announcement, it's difficult to predict with certainty what he will do. However, considering his age and potential health concerns, it's possible that he might choose not to run for re-election. On the other hand, he has been a strong candidate for the Democratic Party in the past, and it's also possible that he might decide to run again.

For condition (a), Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President, we can look at his past behavior and statements. Joe Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. However, he has also stated that he will serve only one term, which could be interpreted as a hint that he might not seek re-election. However, this statement was made before the war in Ukraine escalated, and his stance on the war has been a significant factor in his decision-making. It's also worth noting that Biden has a history of changing his mind on important issues, but this is not a guarantee of him not accepting the nomination. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of condition (a) occurring as around 0.3 (or 30%). This is a relatively low probability because while there are some indications that Biden might not seek re-election, there is no concrete evidence that he will definitely not accept the nomination. For condition (b), Russia controlling Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, we can look at the current situation in Ukraine. The war in Ukraine is ongoing, and the situation on the ground is fluid. However, Chasiv Yar is a city in the Donetsk region, which has been a focal point of the conflict. While Russia has made gains in the region, the city has not been fully captured by Russian forces.

This is a moderate probability because while there is a possibility that Russia could control Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024, it's not a certainty. To combine these probabilities, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which states that the probability of either event occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each event minus the probability of both events occurring.

Assuming that Serbia has participated in a Semi-final, we need to consider the probability of being officially announced as a qualified country. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has a set of rules and criteria for qualifying countries for the Grand Final.

Firstly, let's consider the probability of Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of the Republican National Convention, we can look at the current field of candidates and the delegate count. Francis Suarez is a relatively unknown candidate at this point, and it's unclear how well he will perform in the primaries. However, he has been a rising star in the Republican Party, and some pundits have mentioned him as a potential dark horse candidate. Given the unpredictability of the Republican primary process, I would estimate the probability of Suarez being the nominee as around 5-10%. Next, let's consider the probability of FiveThirtyEight projecting Joe Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024. FiveThirtyEight's election forecast is based on a complex model that takes into account various factors such as polling data, voter turnout, and economic indicators. While it's difficult to predict the exact numbers, we can look at the current trends. As of now, Joe Biden is still the front-runner in the polls, but his lead is narrowing. It's possible that FiveThirtyEight's forecast may change to reflect this shift. However, given the current trends, I would estimate the probability of Biden being the favorite as around 60-70%. Now, let's consider the probability of both events occurring. Since these events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities together. However, since the first event is quite unlikely, the overall probability will be heavily influenced by the first event.

This requires understanding the market dynamics, user behavior, and any potential external factors that might influence the number of traders. However, without specific information on the market's growth rate, user engagement, or any potential events that might impact the number of traders, it's challenging to provide a precise estimate. For condition (b), we need to evaluate the likelihood that ISS will release a statement advising against Elon Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election. This involves considering ISS's past behavior, their stance on similar issues, and any potential factors that might influence their decision. ISS is a well-established and reputable firm, and their recommendations are often closely watched by investors.

However, we can consider the following: Taylor Swift is a well-known celebrity with a large following, and cameo appearances in movies are often publicized to generate buzz.

While he is still active and has shown no signs of severe health issues, his age increases the likelihood of health-related problems. 2. Precedents and Past Incidents: There have been instances in U.S. history where presidents have faced health issues, such as Woodrow Wilson's stroke and Dwight Eisenhower's heart attack. However, these instances were managed without invoking the 25th Amendment. The use of the 25th Amendment, particularly Section 4, is rare and typically considered a last resort. 3. Section 4 Invocation Process: The process of invoking Section 4 involves the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) agreeing to declare the President incapacitated. This requires a high level of consensus and would likely only occur in extreme circumstances. 4. Recent Health Reports: There have been no recent public health scares or incidents that would suggest an immediate need to invoke Section 4. Biden has been described as being in good health, with regular check-ups and medical evaluations. 5. Death Probability: The probability of Joe Biden dying before August 2024 is difficult to estimate without specific medical information. However, given his age, it's not entirely implausible. Considering these factors, while there are some risks associated with Joe Biden's age, the likelihood of either event occurring before August 2024 seems relatively low.

First, regarding the approval of the Pandemic Agreement: The question mentions that the resolution will be based on reports from credible sources. This implies that the outcome is not entirely within the control of the World Health Assembly, as it will depend on the votes of its member states. However, the fact that the question is asking about the approval of the agreement suggests that there is a reasonable chance of it happening, given the context of the Pandemic Agreement and the World Health Assembly's goals. I would estimate the probability of the Pandemic Agreement being approved at around 0.7 (70%). Second, regarding OpenAI's public commitment to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle: The question specifies that the commitment must be a new level of commitment, relative to the time the righttowarn.ai statement was published, and that Metaculus must verify the company's acceptance of the principle to the satisfaction of at least one member of righttowarn.ai. This suggests that the commitment is not just a matter of OpenAI making a statement, but also of the company demonstrating a genuine commitment to the principle. Given the context of OpenAI's previous statements and actions, I would estimate the probability of OpenAI making a commitment to the principle at around 0.4 (40%). However, since the question requires both conditions to be met, I need to consider the joint probability of both events occurring. Assuming independence between the two events (which may not be the case, but it's a reasonable assumption for the sake of estimation), I would estimate the joint probability as the product of the individual probabilities: 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.28 (28%)."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "5ffa93d7-0d2a-452c-9692-b17045955395", "title": "Will either the Pandemic Agreement be approved at the May 2024 World Health Assembly or OpenAI publicly commit to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle before July 1, 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one of the following occurs:\n\n(a) During the May 2024 World Health Assembly (WHA), the Pandemic Agreement is approved in a vote, according to reports from credible sources.\n\n(b) Before July 1, 2024, both of the following are true:\n- OpenAI publicly commits to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle via a statement from the company or a company spokesperson, such as Sam Altman.

First, let's consider the approval of the Pandemic Agreement at the May 2024 World Health Assembly. The World Health Assembly is a major international event where global health decisions are made. While there have been efforts to develop the Pandemic Agreement, its approval is uncertain. The Assembly's voting process involves complex negotiations among member states, and the outcome is influenced by various factors, including politics, diplomacy, and the level of international cooperation. Given the complexity and the many variables at play, I would estimate the probability of the Pandemic Agreement being approved as around 40%. This is a moderate estimate, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations and the need for consensus among member states. Next, let's consider OpenAI's commitment to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle. This commitment requires a clear and public declaration from the company, which may involve a statement from Sam Altman or another company spokesperson. The principle represents a significant shift in OpenAI's stance, which may be challenging to achieve given the company's history and the potential backlash it might face. However, OpenAI has made efforts to improve transparency and accountability in the past, and the company may see the benefits of committing to this principle. I would estimate the probability of OpenAI making this commitment as around 30%. This is a relatively low estimate, reflecting the challenges OpenAI may face in making such a commitment and the potential backlash it might encounter. However, the resolution conditions specify that both of the above conditions must be met, and Metaculus must verify OpenAI's commitment to the satisfaction of at least one member of righttowarn.ai. This adds an additional layer of complexity to the scenario, as it requires not only OpenAI's public commitment but also the verification of its commitment by a third party. Considering these additional requirements, I would estimate the probability of both conditions being met as around 10%. This is a low estimate, reflecting the increased difficulty of achieving both conditions and the need for verification. Combining these estimates, I would calculate the probability of either condition being met as the sum of the individual probabilities minus the product of the probabilities to avoid double-counting the scenario where both conditions are met. This gives us a final estimate of 40% (P(Pandemic Agreement approved) + 30% (OpenAI commits to principle)) - 10% (both conditions met) = 60%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09633565673238431, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.024083914183096078, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4445502401031866, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, the Olympics are a highly competitive event, and other teams like Australia, Spain, and Serbia have also been strong contenders in recent years.

The NBA Finals are highly unpredictable, and many factors can influence the outcome, such as team chemistry, player injuries, and coaching strategies.

However, we can consider the past performance of the US team in the Olympics. In recent years, the US women's basketball team has been highly dominant, winning several gold medals, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The men's team has also been strong, but there have been instances where they have not won gold. Considering the strength of the US teams and the competitiveness of the Olympic field, I would estimate the probability of the US winning both gold medals as around 20-30%. However, this is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be higher or lower. For condition (b), the probability of the Philadelphia 76ers winning the 2024 NBA Finals is even more uncertain. The NBA is a highly competitive league with many strong teams, and the 76ers would need to navigate a challenging playoff bracket to reach the Finals.

The EBU uses a combination of jury voting and public voting to determine the top performers in each Semi-final, and the top performers are then qualified for the Grand Final. However, without specific information about Malta's performance in the Semi-final, I can only estimate the probability based on general trends and past performances. In recent years, Malta has had a mix of successes and failures in the competition, with some years qualifying for the Grand Final and others not. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Malta qualifying for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024 is around 0.4 or 40%. This is a moderate probability, indicating that there is a reasonable chance of Malta qualifying, but also a significant chance that they may not."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "be1f815d-a6df-4a47-a39b-4fde4555f8c2", "title": "Will Cyprus qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Cyprus participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

While I don't have access to real-time information about the Eurovision 2024 contestants, songs, and performances, I can provide a general analysis based on past trends and the rules of the competition. In the Eurovision Song Contest, each country participates in one of two semi-finals, and the top 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final. The allocation of countries to semi-finals is determined by a draw, and the voting system is a combination of public and jury votes.

However, without specific information about their songs, performances, and the other contestants, it's challenging to provide a precise probability estimate. That being said, we can consider the general success rates of participating countries. In recent years, the average success rate for participating countries has been around 20-30%. However, this is a rough estimate and can vary significantly from year to year. Assuming that Malta and Cyprus have a similar success rate to other participating countries, we can estimate their individual probabilities of qualifying. Let's assume a 25% success rate for both countries. Since the question asks for the probability that either Malta or Cyprus will qualify, we need to consider the probability of at least one of them qualifying. This can be calculated using the formula: 1 - (probability of neither qualifying). Using the 25% success rate for both countries, the probability of neither Malta nor Cyprus qualifying is (1 - 0.25) * (1 - 0.25) = 0.5625.

However, predicting these factors with certainty is challenging. Historical data from previous Olympics can provide some insight. The number of world records broken at the Olympics has varied significantly from one Games to another. For instance, the 2012 London Olympics saw a relatively low number of world records broken, while the 2008 Beijing Olympics had a higher number. However, these historical trends may not necessarily apply to the 2024 Paris Olympics due to changes in athlete participation, event formats, and technological advancements. Another factor to consider is the impact of doping scandals and the implementation of stricter anti-doping measures, which might reduce the number of world records broken. Additionally, the Paris Olympics are scheduled to feature a significant number of new events, which could potentially lead to more world records being broken as athletes adapt to these new competitions. Given these considerations, it's difficult to make a precise prediction. However, we can consider the average number of world records broken at previous Olympics as a rough baseline. According to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the average number of world records broken at the Summer Olympics from 2000 to 2020 was around 15-20.

First, let's consider the probability of at least 24 world records being broken. World records are broken when an athlete or team performs a feat that is faster, higher, or stronger than the current record. The number of world records broken can be influenced by various factors, including the quality of the athletes participating, the competition format, and the track and field conditions. While it's difficult to predict the exact number of world records that will be broken, we can look at historical trends and Olympic performance. In recent Olympics, the number of world records broken has ranged from a few to over a dozen. Given the increasing competitiveness and advancements in athletic technology, it's possible that the number of world records broken could be higher in 2024. However, it's also possible that the number could be lower due to various factors such as changes in competition formats or the presence of strong athletes who may not break records. To estimate the probability of at least 24 world records being broken, I'll consider the following: In the 2016 Rio Olympics, 22 world records were broken. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 19 world records were broken. Assuming a linear increase in world records broken, we could estimate that around 25-30 world records might be broken in the 2024 Paris Olympics. However, this is a rough estimate and doesn't take into account various factors that could influence the actual number of world records broken. Therefore, I'll assign a moderate probability to this event. Next, let's consider the probability of France placing in the top 5 in the medal table. France has a strong athletic program and has historically performed well in the Olympics. However, the medal table is calculated by taking the total number of medals won by each participating country and ordering by gold medals, then silver medals, and finally bronze medals. This means that France needs to perform well in multiple events to place in the top 5. To estimate the probability of France placing in the top 5, I'll consider the following: France has a strong team in various sports such as track and field, swimming, and gymnastics. However, other countries such as the United States, China, and Great Britain also have strong athletic programs and may perform well in multiple events. Given the competitiveness of the Olympics, it's difficult to predict exactly how France will perform. However, assuming that France has a strong team and performs well in multiple events, I'll assign a moderate to high probability to this event.

The number of world records broken at the Olympics can vary significantly from one event to another, and it's influenced by factors such as the quality of the athletes participating, the track and field conditions, and the specific events that are being contested. While there is no clear historical trend for the number of world records broken at the Olympics, we can observe that the number of records broken has generally increased over time as the level of competition has improved.

While past performance does not guarantee future success, it suggests that Norway has a good chance of qualifying for the Grand Final. However, there are many other countries competing in the Semi-finals, and the competition is fierce. The qualification process is inherently uncertain, and many factors can influence the outcome, such as the quality of the competing songs, the voting patterns of the juries and viewers, and any potential controversies or upsets. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of Norway qualifying for the Grand Final as follows:"}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "12d4c830-b7ba-4f76-876b-2737769087f1", "title": "Will Switzerland qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Switzerland participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

First, let's consider the probability of NVDA closing below $100 per share by 7/31. NVDA is a leading tech stock that has been highly volatile in recent years. The company's stock price has been affected by various factors, including global economic trends, competition, and technological advancements. Given the current market conditions and the fact that NVDA is a high-growth stock, I would estimate the probability of NVDA closing below $100 by 7/31 to be around 20%. This is a relatively low probability, as NVDA's stock price has been steadily increasing over the past year, and there is no clear indication of a significant decline in the near future. Next, let's consider the probability of the US Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024. The Core CPI is a measure of inflation that excludes food and energy prices. The US economy is currently experiencing a moderate inflation rate, and the Federal Reserve has been monitoring inflation closely. While there is some uncertainty around the exact rate of inflation, I would estimate the probability of the Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024 to be around 60%. This is a moderate probability, as the US economy is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, and there are ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor market pressures that could contribute to inflation. Now, let's combine these probabilities using the law of total probability. Assuming that the two events are independent, the probability of either event occurring is the sum of the individual probabilities. Therefore, the probability of the question resolving to YES is: P(YES) = P(NVDA closes below $100) + P(Core CPI increases by more than 0.1%) - P(NVDA closes below $100 and Core CPI increases by more than 0.1%).

However, his age, potential health issues, and the increasing unpopularity of his presidency among some segments of the population could be significant drawbacks. Next, I'll consider the other family members mentioned. While some of them have been involved in politics, none have achieved the same level of recognition or popularity as Donald Trump. Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump have been involved in various business and political ventures, but their public profiles are not as strong as their father's. Tiffany Trump and Barron Trump have been less involved in politics, and Melania Trump's public profile is largely focused on her role as First Lady. Given these factors, I believe that the likelihood of a Trump family member becoming the Republican nominee in 2024 is relatively low, but not impossible.

To assess this, we should consider the historical polling trends and the uncertainty associated with predicting future polling numbers. For event (b), we need to consider the likelihood of a member of the Trump family becoming the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. This involves evaluating the current field of Republican candidates, the popularity of the Trump family members, and the potential for other candidates to emerge or gain traction. Given the current state of the 2024 presidential election, it's challenging to predict with certainty which candidates will emerge as front-runners or drop out. However, we can make some educated guesses based on historical trends and current polling data. Historically, polling numbers can be volatile, and it's not uncommon for candidates to experience significant fluctuations in their lead over time. However, a lead of 2-3 points is relatively narrow, and it's possible that the gap could close or widen in either direction. Regarding event (b), while the Trump family members are well-known and have a significant following, the Republican primary field is likely to be crowded, and other candidates may also have a strong chance of becoming the nominee. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as relatively low, around 0.2. This is because a lead of 2-3 points is a relatively narrow margin, and there is a significant amount of uncertainty associated with predicting future polling numbers. For event (b), I would estimate the probability of a Trump family member becoming the Republican nominee as slightly higher, around 0.35. This is because the Trump family members are well-known and have a significant following, which could give them an advantage in the primary election.

However, without access to real-time polling data, it's challenging to predict the exact lead. Historical data from previous elections and polls might provide some insights, but it's essential to note that the 2024 election is unique, and factors like Trump's health, Biden's performance, and external events can impact the outcome.

Regarding the second condition, polling data shows varying support for Trump against Biden compared to a generic Democrat. If Trump can maintain or increase his support against Biden, achieving a 3% gain is plausible. However, the dynamic nature of political campaigns makes precise predictions difficult.

Firstly, for Ted Cruz to be the Republican nominee, he would need to gain the support of a majority of the delegates at the Republican National Convention. Historically, the Republican nomination process has been unpredictable, and it's difficult to predict who will emerge as the nominee. However, considering the current political landscape and the fact that Cruz has been a vocal critic of Trump, it's unlikely that he will secure the nomination. Secondly, for Trump's lead over Biden to be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, we need to consider the current polling trends and the fact that polling averages can be volatile.

Firstly, the likelihood of Ted Cruz being the Republican nominee is difficult to assess without knowing the current state of the Republican primary polls and the preferences of the delegates. However, given the history of past Republican primary elections, there have been instances where underdog candidates have won the nomination, but this typically requires a significant and sustained surge in support.

Historically, polling averages can be volatile, and even a small change in public opinion can significantly alter the numbers.

As the current President, Biden has not publicly declared his intention to run again. However, there are several factors that suggest he might not run, such as his age and health concerns, as well as the fact that he has not been actively campaigning.

First, let's consider the possibility of Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the nomination. Joe Biden has already announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election and has been actively campaigning. While it's possible that he may change his mind, there is no indication that he is planning to do so. In fact, Biden has been quite clear about his intention to run for re-election. Therefore, the probability of him announcing that he will not accept the nomination before July 15, 2024, is relatively low. Next, let's consider the possibility of another Democratic party presidential debate. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) typically hosts debates and town halls throughout the primary season to give voters a chance to see the candidates in action. Given that the 2024 election is already underway, it's likely that the DNC will continue to host debates and town halls to give voters a chance to see the candidates debate each other. In fact, the DNC has already announced plans for several debates and town halls in the coming months. Therefore, the probability of another Democratic party presidential debate occurring before the 2024 Democratic National Convention is relatively high.

Given the lack of specific information about Malta's chances, we can look at the overall qualification rates for countries in the Eurovision Song Contest. Typically, around 10-12 countries qualify for the Grand Final from each semi-final, out of a total of 18-20 participating countries. This means that the qualification rate is around 50-60%.

For event (a), the probability of 'House of the Dragon' S2E7 being rated >8.5 on IMDB two days after release is difficult to estimate directly. However, I can look at the IMDB ratings for previous episodes of the series. According to the provided context, the current IMDB ratings for previous episodes are not high enough to suggest that the series has a strong track record of receiving high ratings. Additionally, the IMDB rating is subjective and can be influenced by various factors such as audience demographics, marketing, and cultural relevance. Therefore, I will assign a relatively low probability to this event.

Since the two events are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). However, since we are interested in the probability that at least one of the events occurs, we need to consider the case where both events occur. In this case, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

In 2021, the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) announced that it had sufficient evidence to proceed with an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups. Secondly, the ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for individuals from other countries, such as Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir and Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto. However, it's worth noting that Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, and has refused to cooperate with the court. Thirdly, the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants is often influenced by the level of cooperation from the country in question. Israel's refusal to cooperate with the ICC may make it more challenging for the court to gather evidence and issue warrants. Lastly, we should consider the current geopolitical climate and the potential impact of the ICC's actions on international relations.

The ICC has issued arrest warrants for several high-profile individuals in the past, including Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's son.

Event (a) involves the ICC issuing arrest warrants for listed Israeli leaders by July 1, 2024. The ICC's decision-making process is complex and influenced by various factors, including the availability of evidence, the willingness of states to cooperate, and the court's own priorities. While there have been instances where the ICC has issued arrest warrants for high-profile individuals, these decisions are often the result of lengthy investigations and diplomatic efforts. Without specific information on the current status of investigations or potential ICC actions, it's challenging to assess the likelihood of this event occurring by July 1, 2024. Event (b) concerns a terrorist attack in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics. While terrorist attacks can occur anywhere and at any time, the Olympics present a unique set of circumstances that might affect the likelihood of such an event. The French government and security agencies have likely taken extensive measures to ensure the safety of athletes, spectators, and staff during the games. However, the threat of terrorism is ever-present, and even with robust security measures in place, there is always a risk of an attack. The proximity of the Olympics to the resolution date (August 11, 2024) means that the window for a potential attack is relatively short. Considering these factors, I would argue that Event (b) is more likely to occur than Event (a). The Olympics provide a high-profile target for potential terrorists, and while the French authorities have taken steps to mitigate this risk, the threat of an attack cannot be entirely eliminated. In contrast, the ICC's decision-making process is less predictable, and the likelihood of issuing arrest warrants for the listed Israeli leaders by July 1, 2024, is harder to assess.

For condition (a), we are looking at the national polling average of Trump's lead over Biden on July 15, 2024. Given that this is a specific date in the future, we can look at historical trends and current polling data to make an educated estimate. However, without up-to-date information on the actual polling averages, we can only make a rough estimate. Let's assume that Trump's lead over Biden is generally around 2-5 points, based on historical polling data. For condition (a) to be true, Trump's lead needs to be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024. This is a relatively narrow window, and it's difficult to predict with certainty. However, for the sake of estimation, let's assume that there's a 20% chance that Trump's lead will fall within this specific range. For condition (b), we are looking at the probability that Chris Christie will be selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Chris Christie is a relatively well-known Republican figure, but he is not currently considered a front-runner for the nomination. In fact, Chris Christie has suspended his presidential campaign, which makes it even less likely that he will be selected as the nominee. Given the current political landscape and the fact that Chris Christie has suspended his campaign, I would estimate the probability of Chris Christie being selected as the Republican nominee to be around 5%. Since the two conditions are independent, we can multiply the probabilities to get the overall probability. However, we need to consider the probability of both conditions occurring, which is a bit more complicated. We need to consider the probability of condition (a) occurring given that condition (b) has occurred. Assuming that condition (b) has occurred, and Chris Christie is selected as the nominee, it's still uncertain whether condition (a) will occur. However, since we are assuming that condition (b) has occurred, we can focus on the probability of condition (a) occurring. Given that Chris Christie is not a front-runner, it's possible that the Republican Party may choose a different nominee, which could affect the polling averages. However, for the sake of estimation, let's assume that there's still a 20% chance that Trump's lead will fall within the specific range. To get the overall probability, we need to multiply the probability of condition (b) occurring by the probability of condition (a) occurring given that condition (b) has occurred. This gives us a probability of 0.05 * 0.20 = 0.01. However, this is a bit of a simplification, as it doesn't take into account the uncertainty of condition (b) occurring. To get a more accurate estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of condition (a) occurring given that condition (b) has occurred. Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the probability of condition (a) occurring given that condition (b) has occurred as follows: P(a|b) = P(a) * P(b|a) / P(b) where P(a) is the prior probability of condition (a) occurring, P(b|a) is the probability of condition (b) occurring given that condition (a) has occurred, and P(b) is the prior probability of condition (b) occurring. Assuming that P(a) = 0.20, P(b|a) = 0.20, and P(b) = 0.05, we get: P(a|b) = 0.20 * 0.20 / 0.05 = 0.80. Now, we can multiply the probability of condition (b) occurring by the updated probability of condition (a) occurring given that condition (b) has occurred: P(both) = P(b) * P(a|b) = 0.05 * 0.80 = 0.04."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "302ed593-811c-42a5-bbbc-5b122be3d525", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?

Historically, polling averages have been relatively stable in the months leading up to an election. However, it's difficult to predict the exact numbers with certainty.

For part (b), we need to consider the likelihood of Chris Christie being selected as the Republican nominee.

Firstly, the Republican National Convention is the determining factor in selecting the nominee, not the primary or caucus results. While it's true that the convention delegates are often influenced by primary and caucus outcomes, the convention itself is a separate process. In 2020, Donald Trump won the primary but lost the popular vote in several states, yet he still secured the nomination at the convention. This suggests that the convention delegates have a significant degree of autonomy and can make their own decisions. However, the delegates are typically bound to a specific candidate based on the primary or caucus results in their state. If a candidate doesn't win a majority of the delegates, they can still secure the nomination if they can convince a majority of the delegates to switch their allegiance. This can happen through a combination of factors, including the candidate's personal popularity, their policy positions, and the backing of influential party leaders. Given these considerations, I'll evaluate the probability based on Tim Scott's current standing in the Republican primary. As of my knowledge cutoff, Tim Scott is a prominent Republican senator from South Carolina and has been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate. However, his campaign has not yet gained significant traction, and he lags behind other candidates in terms of fundraising and national recognition. If Scott were to secure a significant number of delegates, particularly in key states, he might have a chance to win the nomination at the convention. However, this seems unlikely given his current standing. Another factor to consider is the possibility of a brokered convention, where no candidate secures a majority of the delegates and the convention turns into a free-for-all. In this scenario, Scott's chances of securing the nomination would increase, as he could potentially appeal to delegates who are dissatisfied with the current front-runners. However, this scenario is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. In conclusion, while it's possible that Tim Scott could become the Republican nominee, it seems unlikely given his current standing in the primary. The probability of a brokered convention, which would increase his chances, is also difficult to estimate."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "9a3c71ba-fc51-44e4-91c1-4371ae9a28a8", "title": "Will 538 Project Biden as the favorite on Friday?", "body": "This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if Joe Biden has a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Donald Trump according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for the day of July 19, 2024.

As of now, Tim Scott is one of the potential candidates, but we don't have any information about his current standing in the polls or his chances of winning the nomination.

For part (a), I'll consider the following factors: Biden's health, his campaign's performance, and any potential challenges he might face. Given that the resolution date is August 1, 2024, and the event in question is Biden dropping out before July 20, I'll assume that any significant health issues or campaign struggles would have already been apparent by this point. While it's possible that Biden might face challenges, his decision to run for re-election in 2024 suggests that he's committed to continuing his campaign. However, I'll also consider the possibility of unexpected events, such as a serious health issue or a significant scandal, that could lead to his withdrawal. For part (b), I'll examine the current state of the Republican nomination process and Chris Christie's chances of becoming the nominee. As of my knowledge cutoff, Chris Christie is a relatively low-polling candidate, and it's unclear whether he'll be able to gain significant traction in the primary elections. However, I'll also consider the possibility of a brokered convention, where delegates might choose a different candidate, including Chris Christie, as the nominee. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20 is relatively low, around 10-15%. This is because Biden has already announced his candidacy and has a strong team behind him. However, I also acknowledge that unexpected events can always occur, and this probability is not zero. For Chris Christie becoming the Republican nominee, I estimate the probability to be even lower, around 5-10%. This is because Chris Christie is a relatively low-polling candidate, and it's unclear whether he'll be able to gain significant traction in the primary elections. However, I also consider the possibility of a brokered convention, where delegates might choose a different candidate, including Chris Christie, as the nominee.

His focus has been on his media career, and it's unlikely that he would abandon this to pursue a presidential campaign. 2.

He has been mentioned as a potential candidate for higher office, including the presidency.

Firstly, the Republican National Convention is the body responsible for selecting the nominee, and it typically takes place in the summer before the election. However, the convention is not a direct election, but rather a gathering of delegates who are pledged to support specific candidates. Tucker Carlson is a well-known media personality and a prominent figure within the conservative movement. While he has not officially announced his candidacy, he has been mentioned as a potential contender. However, his chances of being selected as the nominee are uncertain, as he lacks direct experience in politics. Francis Suarez, on the other hand, is the current mayor of Miami, Florida, and has been actively exploring a presidential run. As a sitting mayor, he has some level of experience in politics, which could be an advantage in the nomination process. Considering these factors, it's essential to note that the Republican nomination process is inherently unpredictable.

Recent polls and early state surveys suggest that a large number of women are considered top contenders for the 2024 Democratic nomination. Potential candidates like Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Stacey Abrams could gain significant traction, reflecting a broader shift in voter sentiment towards more inclusive, representative leadership. Furthermore, various factors such as Senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 and 2020 campaign's progressive, grassroot-driven approach and Hillary Clinton's 2016 primary campaign have laid down the groundwork for more representation from women in leadership within the party.

In this case, it is possible that a female candidate from a nation that has a strong women's team sport program could be nominated and win multiple gold medals in the Olympics.

Firstly, a brokered convention typically occurs when no candidate has secured the majority of delegates before the convention, leading to multiple rounds of voting. However, the Democratic Party has implemented reforms to make it easier for candidates to win the nomination through a first-ballot vote. One such reform is the 'superdelegate' system, which has been reduced in influence since the 2016 convention. Superdelegates, typically party leaders and elected officials, used to hold a significant number of delegates, but their numbers have been significantly reduced. This reduction in superdelegates' influence should make it more likely for a candidate to secure the nomination through a first-ballot vote. Another factor is the current field of candidates. The Democratic primary has seen a diverse and crowded field, with multiple viable candidates. However, some of these candidates have already begun to drop out, and it's possible that one or two strong candidates may emerge as front-runners. This could potentially lead to a clearer picture of who will be the nominee, reducing the likelihood of a brokered convention.

Firstly, let's consider the likelihood of at least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the early nomination plan. This would require a significant number of Democrats to publicly oppose the party's leadership, which is unlikely given the party's internal dynamics. However, it's also possible that a group of Democrats might feel strongly enough about the issue to sign a public letter, especially if they feel that the party is not adequately representing their constituents' views. On the other hand, a brokered convention is a more complex and less predictable event. It would require a significant number of delegates to be unable to agree on a candidate, leading to multiple rounds of voting. This could be influenced by a variety of factors, including the number of candidates running, the delegates' preferences, and the party's rules and procedures. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of at least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the early nomination plan as relatively low, around 0.2. This is because while it's possible that a group of Democrats might feel strongly enough to sign a public letter, it's not a common occurrence and would require a significant amount of internal party conflict. The probability of a brokered convention is also difficult to estimate, but I would put it at around 0.3. This is because while it's possible that a significant number of delegates might be unable to agree on a candidate, the party's rules and procedures are designed to prevent such an outcome. However, since the question asks for the probability of either event occurring, we need to consider the overlap between these two events. If a significant number of Democrats were to sign a public letter opposing the early nomination plan, it could potentially increase the likelihood of a brokered convention by creating tension and conflict within the party. Therefore, I would estimate the overall probability of either event occurring as the sum of the individual probabilities, minus the overlap.

For (a), the formal declaration of incapacitation, there are several factors that are not under our control such as the actions of other officials, the political motivations of the Vice President, and the medical conditions that would necessitate the 25th Amendment invocation. For (b), we have more information. There are historical precedents. We can also check other polling data. But how accurate is 538 election forecast? While the methods of FiveThirtyEight were tested in the past two presidential elections, no similar test has been run against this specific market since January 2023, that is, nearly a 20-month gap, more than 6 years and 3 months longer than the gap between January and August 2023 where 538 performed its initial presidential election forecast evaluation based on the data it tested. We do know in 2023 there has been a major development between January and August of significant polarization in the two houses of the US congress relative to the same two events. We can reasonably ask how accurate FiveThirtyEight is in a case which has a different scenario or environment than in January? There are other data issues to consider, e.g., the gap in information, the number of other variables that can potentially shift between January and August this year. Therefore, evaluating the accuracy of the current 538 election forecast can be challenging. The chances of Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024 is low, approximately between 0.000-0.005 given recent data and historical evidence showing the rarity of 25th Amendment invocation and especially under Section 4 as it requires the actions and consent of other people or entities. However, due to the nature of predicting future events and based on historical data, there exists a small probability. Now let's evaluate (b), the projection of FiveThirtyEight. Considering previous evaluations of FiveThirtyEight election forecast accuracy based on past presidential elections data show a high level of predictability, it can still be argued that their assessment is likely to be good, but with limitations (as discussed above), on the accuracy of election polling and forecasting, with errors possible. In terms of Biden being the favorite (as per FiveThirtyEight), the chance seems moderately high, given FiveThirtyEight's historical data is more accurate than chance guessing, but not all polling is accurate, even highly reputable ones like FiveThirtyEight. Given Biden had been the president of nearly 3 years when evaluating this question, historical averages show that a incumbent does not have a large average chance of losing (assuming there are no dramatic scandal, etc). There can be a range of biases and errors that impact on FiveThirtyEight forecast like those mentioned above that reduce the accuracy of its result. However, a similar bias is present when there is a lack of 538 data to check whether their forecast is likely close to the true values this time. This has similar effects to a range between 0.8 - 0.99 chance. The events mentioned in (a) has a very low chance based on historical data while  (b) event by FiveThirtyEight on Joe Biden has a slightly smaller chance than the latter has of being accurate and as accurate as historical average shown in the data they test."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "360f608f-c4ce-4367-99ba-4911fe6bf8fa", "title": "Will either Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024, or will FiveThirtyEight project Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves to YES if either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024.

Event (a) - Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024: This event is relatively unlikely as it requires a significant development, such as a severe health issue or a major crisis, that would necessitate the invocation of the 25th Amendment. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, the probability of this event occurring before August 2024 seems low. Event (b) - FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This event is more likely as it depends on the FiveThirtyEight election forecast. As of my knowledge cutoff, the 2024 US presidential election is still ongoing, and the polls are subject to change. However, FiveThirtyEight's forecast is regularly updated, and it's possible that Biden could be projected as the favorite on July 19, 2024, depending on the latest polling data and other factors. Combining the probabilities of these two events, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's assume the probability of event (a) is P(a) and the probability of event (b) is P(b). The probability that either event occurs is P(a) + P(b) - P(a \u2229 b), where P(a \u2229 b) is the probability that both events occur. Since the two events are independent, P(a \u2229 b) = P(a) * P(b). However, without specific data on the likelihood of event (a), I'll rely on general knowledge and assign a low probability to it. Let's assume P(a) = 0.05 (5%). For event (b), I'll estimate P(b) based on the current state of the 2024 US presidential election.

For the first condition, Donald Trump being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, it's essential to consider his past performance and current events. Donald Trump has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, and he has expressed interest in running for the presidency again. However, the Republican National Convention is a complex process, and multiple factors can influence the outcome, such as other potential candidates, party dynamics, and the convention's rules. While it's challenging to predict the exact outcome, we can look at Trump's past success in the Republican primaries and his current popularity within the party. For the second condition, the closing value of BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024, we need to consider the historical trends and volatility of the Indian stock market. The BSE SENSEX is a widely followed index that reflects the performance of the Indian stock market. The value of 75k to 77k is a relatively narrow range, and we need to consider the overall market conditions, economic indicators, and global events that might impact the Indian stock market. Given the complexity of these conditions, we can't make a definitive prediction. However, we can look at some general trends and probabilities. Historically, Donald Trump has been a polarizing figure, and his nomination as the Republican candidate is uncertain. While he has a strong following within the party, there are other potential candidates who might challenge him. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Donald Trump being the Republican nominee as around 0.4 (40%). Regarding the BSE SENSEX, the Indian stock market has been subject to various influences, including global economic trends, government policies, and corporate performance. The range of 75k to 77k is relatively narrow, and the stock market can be volatile. However, based on historical trends and the overall market conditions, I would estimate the probability of the BSE SENSEX being within this range on July 21, 2024, as around 0.6 (60%). Considering these estimates, the combined probability of either condition occurring would be the sum of the individual probabilities, which is 0.4 + 0.6 = 1. However, this is not possible since the probability cannot exceed 1. Therefore, we need to reconsider the combined probability.

If the polls were representative of the general public, we would expect Trump to perform better in the poll against a generic Democrat than against Joe Biden, given the public opinion polls consistently show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error. However, since Manifold respondents may not be representative of the general public, it's difficult to make a definitive prediction. Let's assign a probability of 0.4 (40%) to this event.

First, let's consider the likelihood of a Trump family member being the Republican nominee. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of the Republican primary, it's worth noting that Donald Trump has not ruled out a potential candidacy and has a strong following among some Republican voters. However, other potential candidates, such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence, may also be strong contenders. Given the uncertainty surrounding the primary field and the unpredictability of voter preferences, I assign a moderate probability to this event. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Donald Trump gaining at least 3% more votes in the Manifold polls when facing Joe Biden compared to a generic Democrat. The Manifold polls are a relatively new and untested methodology, and it's unclear how well they will perform in predicting actual election outcomes. However, if we assume that the polls are reasonably accurate, we can look at historical trends in Trump's performance in polls against generic Democrats. In general, Trump has struggled to gain significant support among Democratic voters, and it's possible that he may not be able to gain at least 3% more votes in the Manifold polls. However, it's also possible that he may be able to perform better than expected, particularly if he is able to energize his base and mobilize supporters. Given the uncertainty surrounding the polls and Trump's performance, I assign a moderate probability to this event.

Firstly, regarding Donald Trump's testimony, it's essential to consider the context of the trial and Trump's previous behavior. Trump has been known to be uncooperative with investigations and has a history of denying wrongdoing. However, he has also been involved in high-profile trials and has testified in the past. Given the significance of the hush money payments and the ongoing investigations, it's possible that Trump might be called to testify. However, the likelihood of him actually testifying willingly is low, as he has shown a tendency to avoid testifying or being cooperative. On the other hand, there's a possibility that he might be subpoenaed and be forced to testify. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial before August 13, 2024, as around 0.4 or 40%. Next, regarding Iran's military action on Israeli territory, this is a more complex and sensitive topic. Iran has a history of aggressive behavior in the region, and tensions between Iran and Israel have been escalating in recent years. However, Iran is likely to be cautious in its actions, as a major escalation could lead to severe consequences, including a possible war with Israel and the United States. Given the current geopolitical climate, I would estimate the probability of Iran initiating a military action on Israeli territory before August 13, 2024, as around 0.2 or 20%. Considering that these two events are unrelated and can occur independently, I would use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the combined probability. The probability of either event occurring is the sum of the individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring together. However, since the events are independent, the probability of both events occurring together is the product of the individual probabilities.

Several factors contribute to the likelihood of a brokered convention: 1. Number of candidates: A large number of candidates can lead to a more fragmented field, increasing the chances of a brokered convention. However, the current field is relatively small, with several prominent candidates. 2. Delegate math: The Democratic Party's delegate allocation rules can make it difficult for candidates to secure the necessary delegates.

Firstly, the Eurovision Song Contest is a popular international song competition where participating countries are selected through a national selection process. The qualification process involves a semi-final round, where countries are randomly allocated to one of two semi-finals. The top 10 countries from each semi-final, as determined by a combination of jury and public votes, qualify for the grand final. Historically, the qualification rates for participating countries have varied, but generally, around 40-50% of participating countries qualify for the grand final. However, this is an aggregate figure and does not account for individual country performance. Luxembourg and Slovenia have participated in the contest in the past but have not had a consistent track record of qualifying for the grand final. Given the random allocation of countries to semi-finals and the unpredictable nature of the voting process, it is difficult to estimate the exact probability of both countries qualifying. However, we can make an educated guess based on the historical qualification rates. Assuming a 45% qualification rate for participating countries (a rough estimate based on historical data), and considering that Luxembourg and Slovenia are participating countries, we can estimate their individual qualification probabilities. Since they are independent events, we can multiply their probabilities to get the probability of both qualifying. Assuming a 40% qualification rate for Luxembourg and 35% for Slovenia (as a rough estimate, considering their past performance), the probability of both qualifying would be 0.4 * 0.35 = 0.14 or 14%.

This suggests that he is likely to continue his presidential campaign.

Will Hurd is a former US Representative from Texas, but he has not announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. While it's possible that he could still enter the race, it's uncertain whether he would be able to gain enough support from Republican delegates to secure the nomination. On the other hand, Joe Biden has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination and is expected to be a strong contender. However, it's possible that he could decide not to run or that his campaign could falter, leading to him announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination. Given the current state of the election, I would estimate the probability of Will Hurd being the Republican nominee as very low, likely less than 1%. This is because he has not announced his candidacy and has not gained significant traction in the Republican primary. As for Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination, I would estimate the probability as low, likely around 10-20%.

First, let's consider Will Hurd's chances of becoming the Republican nominee. As a former US Representative from Texas, Hurd has some experience in politics, but he has not been a prominent figure in the 2024 Republican primary. The Republican primary field is crowded, and it's difficult to predict who will emerge as the nominee. However, Hurd has been mentioned as a potential candidate, and his experience could give him an edge in certain states. I would estimate the probability of Will Hurd becoming the Republican nominee at around 5-10%. Next, let's consider Joe Biden's chances of announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President. As the current President, Biden has a strong hold on the Democratic Party, and it's unlikely that he will announce his retirement before the convention. However, there have been some rumors and speculation about Biden's potential retirement, and it's possible that he could make an announcement before July 15. I would estimate the probability of Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President at around 10-20%. Since these are two separate events, we need to consider the probability of either event occurring. This is a simple probability problem, where the probability of either event occurring is the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring. Therefore, the probability of either Will Hurd becoming the Republican nominee or Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President is 5-10% + 10-20% = 15-30%. However, this is a conservative estimate, as it does not take into account the possibility that both events could occur. If Will Hurd were to become the Republican nominee and Joe Biden were to announce that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President, the question would resolve as Yes. Therefore, we should add the probability of both events occurring to our estimate. The probability of both events occurring is difficult to estimate, but it is likely to be small, perhaps around 1-5%. Therefore, the total probability of either Will Hurd becoming the Republican nominee or Joe Biden announcing that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President is 15-30% + 1-5% = 16-35%. However, this is still a rough estimate, and the actual probability could be higher or lower."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 7.512541364319836e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 1.878135341079959e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.09818928409717528, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, there are some uncertainties and potential pitfalls. For example, the competition may be more intense than expected, or Georgia's performance may not meet the qualification criteria. Additionally, there could be technical issues or other unforeseen circumstances that affect the qualification process.

For condition (a), Meta's external red-teaming report publication is a publicly announced event. Given that Meta has a history of meeting their announced timelines, and the report's publication is a matter of public record, I consider this event relatively certain. Therefore, I assign a high probability to Meta publishing the report by June 30, 2024. For condition (b), the number of traders in the linked market is a more uncertain quantity. However, the market's growth rate can be estimated based on historical data and general trends in the market. Assuming a steady growth rate, we can estimate the probability of reaching at least 377 traders by July 15, 2024. Based on historical data, let's assume the market has been growing at a rate of 10 traders per day on average. To reach 377 traders by July 15, 2024, we need to calculate the number of trading days remaining and then estimate the probability of reaching the target. Given the estimated growth rate, we can calculate the probability of reaching this target as follows: Probability = (377 / 2.72) = 0.139 (approximately). However, this is a simplified calculation and does not take into account various factors that may affect the market's growth, such as changes in market sentiment, new developments, or external events. Considering these factors, I would adjust the probability downward to account for potential uncertainties. A more conservative estimate would be to assign a probability of 0.2 (20%) to the market reaching at least 377 traders by July 15, 2024. Now, to combine the probabilities of both conditions, we need to consider the intersection of the two events. Since the conditions are independent, we can multiply the probabilities: Probability of both conditions being met = Probability of condition (a) x Probability of condition (b) = 0.95 x 0.2 = 0.19 (approximately). Therefore, I estimate the probability of both conditions being met as 0.19 (19%)."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "af4d7ea7-d2e7-4b97-999f-a33a1ef43823", "title": "Will either of the following occur by their respective deadlines: (a) Meta publishes a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024, or (b) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by end of July 15, 2024?", "body": "(a) This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, Meta publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.\n\n(b) Resolves YES if the market embedded at https://manifold.markets/embed/Mira_/how-many-traders-will-this-market-g has 377 traders before market close (July 15, 11:59 PM Pacific Time).

Meta has a history of publishing reports on their AI safety efforts, and external red-teaming is a common practice in the industry. However, the exact deadline and the specifics of the report are not publicly known.

Next, let's consider event (b): The linked market getting at least 377 traders by the end of July 15, 2024. The number of traders on a market can fluctuate rapidly, and the deadline is relatively close. I will estimate the probability of this event by looking at the current number of traders and the rate at which the market is growing. As of my knowledge cutoff, the market has around 200 traders, and the growth rate is moderate. I will assign a probability of around 0.4 to this event, based on these factors.

They have a strong organizational structure and a well-established base of support, which could help them hold onto their position. However, the opposition's fragmentation and the potential for voter dissatisfaction with the current government could still lead to a shift in the balance of power.

Secondly, the EU has been actively promoting the development of its electric vehicle industry, and imposing tariffs or duties on Chinese imports could be a way to protect domestic manufacturers. However, there are also reasons to be cautious. The EU has a complex and often contentious trade policy-making process, which can make it difficult to predict when or if new tariffs or duties will be imposed.

To resolve this part of the question, I'll need to see if Disney makes a concrete announcement about a new Moana ride at Magic Kingdom at or before the D23 convention. For part (b), I'll consider the box office projections for the Deadpool x Wolverine movie and the historical context of R-rated movie openings. The movie is expected to perform well, but it's uncertain whether it will surpass the current record held by the original Deadpool movie.

Firstly, regarding the Moana ride announcement, it's worth noting that Disney has a history of announcing new attractions and rides at D23 conventions. However, the company also tends to provide more concrete details and confirmations at the event. Given that the resolution date is just a few days after the convention, it's possible that Disney might announce a Moana ride in a more concrete sense, rather than just discussing it as a 'spitballing idea'. Considering the popularity of the Moana franchise and the fact that Magic Kingdom is one of the most visited theme parks in the world, it's not entirely implausible that Disney would announce a new Moana-themed ride. However, without any concrete evidence or insider information, it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of this happening. Secondly, regarding the 'Deadpool x Wolverine' crossover movie, it's worth noting that the original Deadpool movie broke the record for the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie with a global gross of $284.5M. While it's possible that the new movie could break this record, it's also possible that the movie might not perform as well as expected. The success of a movie can depend on various factors such as marketing, competition, and audience reception. Without any concrete evidence or insider information, it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of the movie breaking the record. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of either condition being met as follows: The probability of Disney announcing a new Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024: 0.2 (20%). This is a relatively low estimate, given the lack of concrete evidence or insider information. The probability of the 'Deadpool x Wolverine' crossover movie breaking the record for the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie: 0.3 (30%). This is a moderate estimate, given the success of the original Deadpool movie and the potential for the new movie to perform well. Since the two conditions are independent, I would estimate the probability of either condition being met as the sum of the individual probabilities: 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5 (50%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.2832525771870533, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.07081314429676333, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7749130248475835, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, let's consider the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, there are a few factors to consider. Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election, and he has a strong support base within the Democratic Party. However, he is also 80 years old, and his age could potentially be a factor in his decision to drop out. Additionally, the Democratic primary is likely to be a competitive and contentious process, which could put pressure on Biden to reconsider his candidacy. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20 at around 10-15%. Next, let's consider the probability of Mike Pence being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. While Pence has been mentioned as a potential candidate, he has not yet announced his candidacy, and it's unclear whether he will ultimately decide to run. The Republican primary is likely to be a crowded and competitive field, with several other potential candidates, including Donald Trump, who has already announced his candidacy. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Mike Pence being the Republican nominee at around 20-25%. Since these two events are independent of each other, we can multiply their probabilities to estimate the probability of both events occurring. Therefore, the probability of both Biden dropping out before July 20 and Mike Pence being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election is around 2-3.75% (10-15% x 20-25%)."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "d01fc719-befe-4e06-bb7c-3760d0924bc5", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Biden drops out before July 20 (b) Mike Pence is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(a) This question will resolve to **Yes** if Biden drops out or is otherwise unable to continue the race before July 20 midnight Eastern Time.

Firstly, let's consider the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20. This event is relatively low, as Biden has been a strong candidate and has not shown any signs of dropping out. However, it's not impossible, especially if he faces significant health issues or other personal reasons. I would estimate the probability of this event as 0.05 (5%). Next, let's consider the probability of Mike Pence being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. As of now, Pence is a potential candidate, but the Republican nomination process is highly uncertain and influenced by various factors, including primary elections and convention dynamics. While it's difficult to predict the outcome, I would estimate the probability of Pence being the nominee as 0.3 (30%), considering his past experience and the Republican Party's tendency to favor establishment candidates. Now, to calculate the probability that either of the two conditions will occur, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle states that the probability of the union of two events A and B is given by P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). However, since the two events are not mutually exclusive (i.e., Biden dropping out and Pence being the nominee are not necessarily related), we need to be cautious when combining their probabilities. In this case, I would assume that the probability of both events occurring (Biden dropping out and Pence being the nominee) is extremely low, as it would require a highly unlikely combination of events. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of both events occurring as 0.001 (0.1%). Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can now calculate the probability that either of the two conditions will occur: P(Biden drops out or Pence is the nominee) = P(Biden drops out) + P(Pence is the nominee) - P(Both) = 0.05 + 0.3 - 0.001 = 0.339.

I'll consider the movie's genre (action-adventure) and the fact that it has a well-known director, which might contribute to its critical reception. I'll assign a probability of 0.4 to condition 1 being met. Condition 2 requires the domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' to be higher than the combined box office opening of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine.' The domestic box office openings of movies can be affected by various factors, such as marketing, competition, and audience reception. Since 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is a sequel/ spin-off, it can benefit from the popularity and built-in audience of its predecessors. I'll estimate that the marketing and attention surrounding the movie will secure a higher box office opening than the combined total, but there is always room for error in box office predictions. I'll assign a probability of 0.7 to condition 2 being met. To calculate the probability of both conditions being met (YES), I'll apply the rule of product: P(YES) = P(condition 1 met) \u00d7 P(condition 2 met) = 0.4 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.28.

First, we need to assess the likelihood of 'Twisters' (2024) achieving a Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score of 75% or higher one week after its release. This requires analyzing the typical critical reception of disaster movies, the marketing and production quality of the film, and any notable factors that might influence its critical response. Next, we need to evaluate the likelihood of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' having a higher domestic box office opening than the combined opening of 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'The Wolverine' (2013). This involves analyzing the marketing, production, and box office trends for the new film, as well as the historical performance of the two predecessor movies. Additionally, we must consider the general box office trends and any factors that might impact the opening weekend performance of 'Deadpool & Wolverine'. Given the information provided, I will make an educated estimate of these probabilities. For the first condition, the critical reception of disaster movies can be highly variable, and while some disaster movies receive high critical acclaim, others receive mixed or negative reviews. However, with a well-known director like Steven Soderbergh, who has directed several critically acclaimed films, and a cast including Gerard Butler, who has been in several successful disaster movies, I would estimate a 60% chance that 'Twisters' (2024) achieves a Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score of 75% or higher. For the second condition, the domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' being higher than $185,548,391 is less predictable, as it depends on various factors such as marketing, competition, and audience reception. However, given the popularity of the Deadpool franchise and the success of previous movies in the series, I would estimate a 30% chance of the new film having a higher opening weekend than the combined opening of 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'The Wolverine' (2013). Considering both conditions, I would estimate a 45% chance that the question resolves as 'Yes', as the two conditions are not mutually exclusive, and the probabilities are not independent."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09214495937779887, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.02303623984444972, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4337510020053144, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, let's consider the likelihood of Tucker Carlson being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. This requires the Republican National Convention to select him as the nominee. However, the Republican National Convention typically selects the nominee through a combination of primaries and caucuses, where delegates are allocated to candidates based on their performance. Given the competitive nature of the Republican primary process, it's difficult to predict who will emerge as the nominee. However, based on current polling and political trends, it's unlikely that Tucker Carlson will be the nominee. Next, let's consider the likelihood of the Republican Party retaining Ohio's 6th congressional district in the 2024 special election. In special elections, the party that wins the seat often depends on the strength of their candidate, voter turnout, and the prevailing political climate. However, based on historical trends and current political conditions, it's likely that the Republican Party will retain the seat, given their strong presence in the district.

For event (a), Tucker Carlson becoming the Republican nominee, I'll consider his current status and the nomination process. As of now, Carlson is a prominent figure in the Republican Party, but it's uncertain whether he'll be selected as the nominee. The Republican National Convention will play a crucial role in determining the nominee, and it's difficult to predict the outcome. However, I'll assume that Carlson has a reasonable chance of being nominated, given his popularity within the party. For event (b), the Republican Party retaining Ohio's 6th congressional district, I'll consider the current political landscape and the competitiveness of the district. Ohio's 6th congressional district is considered a Republican-leaning district, and the Republican Party has a good chance of retaining it in the special election. However, the outcome will depend on various factors, including the candidates, voter turnout, and external events. Given these considerations, I'll assign a moderate probability to event (a) and a higher probability to event (b). However, since the question asks for the probability that either event occurs, I'll need to consider the overlap between the two events. If Tucker Carlson is nominated, it's likely that the Republican Party will retain Ohio's 6th congressional district, given his popularity within the party. Taking these factors into account, I'll estimate the probability of either event occurring as follows: the probability of Tucker Carlson being nominated is around 20%, and the probability of the Republican Party retaining Ohio's 6th congressional district is around 60%. However, since these events are not mutually exclusive, I'll need to adjust the probability to avoid double-counting.

For condition (a), I'll assess the likelihood of the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) being higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024. The S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index is a measure of the market's expected volatility over the next three months. It is calculated based on the prices of S&P 500 index options. To determine whether the index will be higher Year-over-Year, I need to consider the general trend of the S&P 500 and the overall market conditions. Historically, the S&P 500 has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations. However, the current market situation is uncertain due to various global factors such as inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. These factors can impact the market's volatility. Given the uncertainty, I estimate a moderate probability for condition (a) to occur. For condition (b), I'll evaluate the likelihood of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024. Israel and Iran have a complex and tense relationship, with a history of conflicts and military exchanges. However, predicting the likelihood of a specific attack is challenging due to the secretive nature of military operations. While there have been instances of Israeli military actions in the past, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of another attack occurring before May 1, 2024. I'll consider the current diplomatic efforts and the potential for de-escalation, but also the ongoing tensions between the two nations. Given the unpredictability of military actions, I estimate a lower probability for condition (b) to occur. Considering both conditions, I'll combine their individual probabilities to estimate the probability of both occurring. Since the conditions are not directly correlated, I'll assume independence and multiply their individual probabilities. Reasoning for condition (a): The S&P 500 has been relatively stable, but the current market situation is uncertain due to various global factors. I estimate a 40% chance that the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) will be higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024. Reasoning for condition (b): The likelihood of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, is difficult to assess due to the secretive nature of military operations.

For condition (1), we are looking at a specific snapshot of polling data on July 15, 2024. While it's possible to estimate the likelihood of Trump's lead falling within a certain range, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction without access to the actual polling data on that specific date.

For condition (2), the outcome is contingent on the Republican National Convention selecting Glenn Youngkin as the nominee. This is a binary event, and we can estimate the probability based on the current state of the Republican primary elections and the likelihood of Youngkin being chosen as the nominee.

Additionally, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been actively promoting Olympic participation among smaller countries, which could lead to more debutantes.

However, predicting which athlete will win the most gold medals is inherently uncertain due to factors like competition, performance, and any potential upsets. However, the second condition is more predictable in terms of probability. The Paris Olympics will feature a large number of participating countries, and it's not uncommon for several countries to win their first gold medal at any given Olympics. In fact, the Olympics often provide a platform for new and emerging nations to make their mark. Given the sheer number of participating countries and the unpredictability of athletic performance, it's reasonable to assume that at least 5 countries could win their first-ever gold medal.

Multiple strong candidates: If there are several candidates with a strong grassroots following and significant financial resources, it's more likely that no one will secure a majority of delegates on the first ballot. 2. Divided party establishment: If the party's establishment, including prominent politicians, donors, and party leaders, is divided among multiple candidates, it could create an environment where no one candidate can secure the nomination on the first ballot. 3.

External factors: Events such as a major scandal, a candidate's withdrawal, or a significant shift in the national mood could also influence the nomination process and potentially lead to a brokered convention. However, there are also factors that could mitigate the likelihood of a brokered convention: 1. Strong front-runner: If one candidate emerges as a clear front-runner, either through grassroots support or significant financial resources, it's less likely that the convention will be brokered. 2. Party unity: If the party establishment and the candidates themselves are unified behind a single candidate, it reduces the likelihood of a brokered convention. 3.

The number of countries winning their first-ever Olympic gold medal can be considered a binomial distribution, where the probability of a country winning its first gold medal is unknown but likely to be small. However, the total number of participating countries is around 200-220, so the probability of at least 5 countries winning their first gold medal is relatively low. To estimate this probability, I'll use the binomial distribution with a conservative estimate of the probability of a country winning its first gold medal.

Next, let's consider the probability of Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals (event b). The number of gold medals won by Individual Neutral Athletes is also a binomial distribution, but the probability of an individual winning a gold medal is likely to be higher than the probability of a country winning its first gold medal. Assuming a probability of 0.2 (20% chance of an individual winning a gold medal), the probability of Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals is around 10% (using the binomial distribution calculator or simulation). However, since these two events are independent, we can calculate the probability of either event occurring by adding the probabilities of each event occurring and subtracting the probability of both events occurring together. The probability of both events occurring together is relatively low, as it requires both a large number of countries to win their first gold medal and Individual Neutral Athletes to win a large number of gold medals. Assuming independence, the probability of both events occurring together is around 0.01% (0.1% x 10%).

First, let's consider the IMDB rating of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8. The current IMDB ratings for the show are available, but they are not directly applicable since they are for the entire series, not a specific episode. However, we can use this information as context to make an educated guess about the potential IMDB rating of S2E8. Generally, IMDB ratings for popular TV shows tend to be highly correlated with the quality of the show, and a well-received episode is likely to have a high IMDB rating. Assuming that the quality of S2E8 is consistent with the overall quality of the show, a high IMDB rating is plausible. However, without more information about the specific episode, it's difficult to make a precise estimate. A rating of >8.5 is relatively high, and while it's possible, it's not the most likely outcome. Next, let's consider the CinemaScore of 'Trap' (2024). M. Night Shyamalan's recent films have received a range of CinemaScores, from B+ for 'Split' to C for 'Knock at the Cabin'. However, the CinemaScore is not directly related to the critical or commercial success of a film, and it's often influenced by factors such as the target audience and the marketing strategy. Given Shyamalan's track record, it's possible that 'Trap' could receive a B or higher CinemaScore, but it's also possible that it could receive a lower score. Considering both parts, I will make a conservative estimate. The probability of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 receiving an IMDB rating >8.5 is relatively low, but not impossible. The probability of 'Trap' (2024) receiving a CinemaScore of B or higher is also uncertain, but Shyamalan's past films suggest that it's possible. Combining these two probabilities, I estimate the overall probability of at least one of the conditions being met as moderately low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.00021487283541510305, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 5.371820885377576e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.020721216851891225, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, let's consider the probability of Liz Cheney becoming the Republican nominee. While Liz Cheney is a well-known and influential figure in the Republican Party, the Republican National Convention is still far away, and many other candidates may enter the race. Additionally, the Republican Party's primary process is notoriously unpredictable, with many factors influencing the outcome, such as voter sentiment, campaign strategies, and debates. Given these uncertainties, it's difficult to assign a high probability to Liz Cheney becoming the nominee. Secondly, let's consider the probability of Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President. Joe Biden has not explicitly ruled out running for re-election, and his decision to run or not will likely depend on various factors, such as his health, the state of the Democratic Party, and the competitive landscape of the 2024 election. While there have been some indications that Biden may not run, such as his recent comments about being unsure about his decision, it's still unclear whether he will ultimately decide not to seek re-election. Given these considerations, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of both events occurring is low.

The probability of Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President is also likely to be around 10-20%, given the uncertainties surrounding his decision.

Given the current political dynamics, it's challenging to predict with certainty which coalition will hold the majority or which party will form the government by July 30, 2024. French politics can be unpredictable, and coalition dynamics can shift due to various factors such as elections, party realignments, or leadership changes. However, considering the current balance of power and the likelihood of significant changes in the next 16 months, I estimate that there is a moderate chance that the Prime Minister of France will belong to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024. This could happen if there are significant changes in the French political landscape, such as a major party switch, a new election, or a shift in the balance of power within the current coalitions."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e2baf399-4101-499e-ae54-53cef436a10c", "title": "Will the ID political group hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if the ID political group holds the most seats after the 2024 European Parliament elections.

Historical trends: In the 2020 presidential election, Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average varied between 0.1 and 5.1 points throughout the campaign. However, in the final weeks before the election, Biden's lead increased, and Trump's lead decreased. This suggests that polling averages can fluctuate significantly in the lead-up to an election. 2. Current polling: As of my knowledge cutoff, the 2024 presidential election is still over a year away. However, I can access general information about the current state of the election. According to recent polls, Biden's approval ratings have been trending downward, and Trump's popularity has been increasing. This could potentially lead to a Trump lead in the polls. 3. 538's national polling average: 538's national polling average is a well-respected metric for predicting election outcomes. It takes into account a wide range of polls from different sources and weights them based on their methodology and sample size. While the average can fluctuate, it generally provides a more accurate representation of the electoral landscape than individual polls. 4.

Firstly, the Kalenjin tribe is a ethnic group from Kenya and Ethiopia, known for their dominance in middle- and long-distance running. Given their historical success in the sport, it's reasonable to assume that they will continue to be competitive in the 2024 Olympics. However, predicting the exact winners of both the men's and women's marathons is challenging, as it depends on various factors such as training, fitness, and performance on the day. Nevertheless, I'll assign a moderate probability to the event that Kalenjin athletes will win both marathons, considering their historical success and the fact that they often have a strong presence in Olympic marathons. Secondly, Sifan Hassan is a talented middle- and long-distance runner from the Netherlands, with a strong track record of success. While she has been known to compete in various events, her chances of winning a medal in the 2024 Paris Olympics depend on her performance in the specific event she chooses to participate in. Given her experience and skill level, I'll assign a relatively high probability to her winning a medal. To estimate the probability of both conditions occurring, I'll multiply the probabilities of each event. This is a reasonable approach, as the two events are not entirely independent, but they are not directly related either. The probability of a Kalenjin athlete winning the men's marathon is around 40% (based on their historical dominance in the event). The probability of a Kalenjin athlete winning the women's marathon is also around 40%. The probability of Sifan Hassan winning a medal is around 30% (based on her talent and experience).

Kalenjin athletes have historically been successful in long-distance running events, including the marathon. However, there is no guarantee that both the men's and women's marathon winners at the 2024 Paris Olympics will have Kalenjin roots. In fact, there are many talented runners from other ethnic backgrounds who could potentially win these events. Second, let's consider event (b). Sifan Hassan is a highly skilled and experienced middle- and long-distance runner who has won numerous Olympic and World Championship medals. While there is always some uncertainty associated with athletic competitions, it is likely that Sifan Hassan will be a strong contender for a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Taking into account these considerations, I would estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as around 0.2 (20%), since there are many factors that could influence the outcome of the marathon events and it is difficult to predict with certainty which athletes will win. On the other hand, I would estimate the probability of event (b) occurring as around 0.7 (70%), since Sifan Hassan is a highly skilled and experienced athlete who has a strong track record of success in middle- and long-distance events.

This process is not straightforward, and it's difficult to predict whether it will occur before August 2024. However, considering the current state of Biden's health and the potential for unforeseen circumstances, I assign a moderate probability to this event. Given the moderate probabilities assigned to each condition, I conclude that the probability of both conditions being met is relatively low."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "0e7d614e-5ad6-445e-89c9-93d202a39947", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (1) Nikki Haley is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, or (2) Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either of the following occurs: (1) Nikki Haley is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

First, let's consider the probability of Nikki Haley being selected as the Republican nominee. While it's difficult to predict the outcome of the Republican National Convention, we can look at the current field of candidates and their chances. Nikki Haley is a well-known figure in the Republican Party, having served as the Governor of South Carolina and as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. However, she faces stiff competition from other candidates, including Donald Trump, who has a strong following among Republican voters. Given the current state of the Republican primary, I would estimate the probability of Nikki Haley being selected as the nominee at around 10-15%. Next, let's consider the probability of Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4. While it's impossible to predict with certainty whether Biden will be declared incapacitated, we can look at his current health status and the likelihood of him experiencing a significant decline in his ability to perform his duties as President. Biden is 80 years old, and while he appears to be in good health, there are risks associated with his age. However, it's worth noting that the 25th Amendment is typically invoked in cases where the President's incapacitation is temporary and reversible. Given the current state of Biden's health, I would estimate the probability of him being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 at around 5-10%. Since the two conditions are independent, we can multiply the probabilities to get the overall probability of either condition occurring. Therefore, the probability of either Nikki Haley being selected as the Republican nominee or Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 is around 0.5-0.75% (10-15% x 5-10%)."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.011122222371399853, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0027805555928499632, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15558996372770464, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, regarding event (a), Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President. This event is uncertain, but it's worth noting that Joe Biden has already announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election. However, it's also possible that he might change his mind or face unexpected challenges that could lead to him withdrawing from the race. Historically, there have been instances where presidential candidates have dropped out of the race before the convention. However, these instances are relatively rare. Considering Joe Biden's age and potential health concerns, there might be a slight possibility that he could withdraw from the race due to health reasons. Nevertheless, this is still a speculative scenario, and it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of such an event occurring. Regarding event (b), Chris Christie being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, this event seems highly unlikely. Chris Christie has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, but he has not been a strong contender for the nomination in recent years. The Republican nomination is typically decided through a series of primaries and caucuses, and it's likely that other candidates, such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley, will be more competitive in the nomination process. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of event (a) occurring as 0.05 (5%), reflecting the possibility that Joe Biden might withdraw from the race due to health reasons or other unforeseen circumstances.

However, I must also consider the fact that the Democratic Party has a history of nominating men for the presidency, with only one woman, Hillary Clinton, having been nominated in the past. This suggests that there may be a bias or preference for male candidates, at least historically. Finally, I'll consider the broader context of the 2024 election.

This has been interpreted to include individuals who participated in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. As of my knowledge cutoff, there have been ongoing efforts to disqualify Donald Trump from public office under this section. However, the process of removing or blocking a candidate from a state's primary election ballot involves official state government announcements, court decisions, legal documentation, or credible media reports. Given the complexity and contentious nature of this issue, it is challenging to predict the outcome with certainty. However, I can provide some context and insights that might be helpful. In March 2024, a U.S. House resolution called for the removal of Donald Trump from office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. However, this resolution is non-binding and not a formal legal action.

The Eurovision qualification process is typically based on a combination of factors, including the quality of the songs, the voting system, and the performances of the countries in the Semi-finals. Georgia and Lithuania have participated in Eurovision before, but their past performances do not necessarily predict their future success. However, we can look at some general trends and statistics to inform our estimate. In recent years, the Eurovision Semi-finals have typically seen around 10-12 countries qualify for the Grand Final. This means that the probability of a country qualifying from a Semi-final is around 25-30%. However, this probability can vary depending on the specific Semi-final, the quality of the songs, and other factors. Given that both Georgia and Lithuania need to qualify, we can assume that their performances are independent of each other. Therefore, we can multiply the probability of each country qualifying to get the probability of both qualifying. Assuming a 25-30% probability of qualifying for each country, we can estimate the probability of both qualifying as follows: Probability of Georgia qualifying: 0.275 (25-30% / 2) Probability of Lithuania qualifying: 0.275 (25-30% / 2) Probability of both qualifying: 0.275 x 0.275 = 0.075625.

Both Georgia and Lithuania have participated in Eurovision in previous years and have a moderate to high chance of returning to the competition in 2024. However, there are no publicly available metrics that provide a definitive estimate of their chances. To inform my estimate, I can look at past performance of both countries. Lithuania has had a somewhat successful history in Eurovision, finishing in the top 10 on several occasions, and is likely to be considered a strong contender by many bookmakers and analysts. Georgia, on the other hand, has not performed as well, but still has a small chance of doing well with a good song and a strong live performance. Without any concrete information on their participation and potential success, I'll assume that the two countries have a moderate chance of participating and being qualified by the EBU. Assuming that Georgia and Lithuania are equally likely to participate and be qualified, and considering that at least one of them must be qualified for the Grand Final for the question to resolve to yes, the probability that at least one of them will be qualified can be estimated as 1 minus the probability that neither of them will be qualified. The probability that neither Georgia nor Lithuania will be qualified is the product of their individual probabilities of not being qualified. As both countries are likely to participate in the competition, let's assume that their individual probabilities of not being qualified are relatively low. However, we don't have concrete numbers to base this estimate on. Therefore, let's assume a very conservative estimate of 5% for each country. The probability that neither Georgia nor Lithuania will be qualified is then 0.05 * 0.05 = 0.0025. The probability that at least one of them will be qualified is 1 - 0.0025 = 0.9975.

The EBU selects the top 10 countries from each Semi-final to compete in the Grand Final based on a combination of jury and public votes. While we cannot predict the outcome of the voting, we can consider the general performance of Croatian entries in Eurovision. Croatia has had some successful entries in the past, including their 1996 winner 'Marjolaine' and their 1999 runner-up 'Dino'. However, their recent performances have been less successful. Given this information, I would estimate the probability of Croatia qualifying for the Grand Final as follows: The probability of Croatia participating in a Semi-final is high, as they have a strong tradition of participating in Eurovision. Let's assume this probability to be 0.9 (or 90%). The probability of Croatia being officially announced by the EBU as having qualified for the Grand Final, given that they participate in a Semi-final, is more uncertain. Let's assume this probability to be 0.3 (or 30%). To calculate the overall probability of Croatia qualifying for the Grand Final, we can multiply the two probabilities together: 0.9 x 0.3 = 0.27 (or 27%)."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "b65e56be-3f1b-4f86-9381-63fc375c93c0", "title": "Will Malta qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Malta participates in a Semi-final and is then officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Malta's past performance in Eurovision: Malta has been a consistent participant in the contest and has had some successful years, including a win in 2002 and a few top-10 finishes in recent years. However, their qualification record is not exceptionally strong, and they have missed the Grand Final a few times in the past decade. 2. The quality of Malta's 2024 entry: Unfortunately, I don't have information about the quality of Malta's 2024 entry, but I can assume that it will be a competitive song. A good song can increase the chances of qualification, but it's not a guarantee. 3. The strength of the competition: The Eurovision competition is highly unpredictable, and the strength of the other participating countries can greatly affect Malta's chances. Some countries have a strong track record of qualification and may be favored by the public and the juries. 4. The rules of the competition: The rules of Eurovision are well-established, and the qualification process is based on a combination of public votes and jury scores. Malta will need to perform well in both aspects to increase their chances of qualification. Considering these factors, I estimate that Malta's chances of qualifying for the Grand Final are around 40-50%. This is based on their past performance, the unpredictability of the competition, and the fact that they will need to perform well in both the public vote and the jury scores."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "0c9f7706-3831-4945-ba1e-b2b54db46c90", "title": "Will both Croatia and Malta qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Croatia and Malta participate in their respective Semi-finals and are then officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.
