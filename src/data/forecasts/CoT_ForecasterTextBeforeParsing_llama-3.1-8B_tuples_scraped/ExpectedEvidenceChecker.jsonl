If Joe Biden decides not to run, it's likely that he would make an announcement before the nomination process begins, to avoid causing confusion and to allow other candidates to prepare for the nomination. 3. The potential consequences of not running: If Joe Biden decides not to run, it could create a power vacuum in the Democratic Party, potentially leading to a contested nomination process. This could be a significant factor in his decision-making process. 4. The current political climate: The current political climate is highly uncertain, with various factors such as the economy, foreign policy, and social issues influencing public opinion. This uncertainty could make it more difficult for Joe Biden to make a decision about his candidacy. 5.

In order to determine the likelihood that Trump will be removed, it's essential to review relevant state laws and Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Although state laws vary, courts typically follow federal precedents established by the U.S. Supreme Court. Relevant courts will consider the conditions necessary for a candidate's eligibility for federal office in determining whether a candidate has been removed or blocked from a state's primary election ballot under Section 3. Considering the current political environment, the likelihood of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as of July 15, 2024 is relatively low. This is because the process of removal typically involves a court decision, which can be a lengthy and complex process. Additionally, the question explicitly states that speculative reports, opinion pieces, or unofficial announcements will not suffice for resolution. Therefore, it's unlikely that Trump will be removed or blocked solely based on media speculation. Given the current information available and the complexity of the removal process, I would estimate the probability of this question resolving as 'Yes' as follows:"}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "fc491703-75ef-4d9c-ada2-51b023cfc083", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The question also states that speculative reports, opinion pieces, or unofficial announcements will not suffice for resolution. This suggests that the decision to remove or block Trump must be based on concrete evidence and not on speculation or hearsay. 3. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is a provision that disqualifies individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding public office.

However, at the Olympic Games, it's hard to predict exact medal tallies due to the complexities of team compositions, strategic decisions, and the competition's overall competitiveness. 2. Global Talent Pool and Competition: Olympic competitions become increasingly competitive due to more countries participating in the Olympics and the influx of exceptional athletes from previously under-represented areas. Even with the high standard of American athletes, the challenge from other international teams in specific sports like track and field, shooting, wrestling, and various team events cannot be disregarded. 3. Balance of Individual and Team Competitions: The Olympics cover a vast array of competitions, with both individual events and team events. America's chances in individual competitions are well-documented but team efforts, where teamwork and tactics play a bigger role, can sometimes shift the overall medal count due to different strategic approaches, team coordination, and performance under pressure. 4. Medal Prediction Models: The accuracy of medal predictions at the Olympic level is known to vary significantly. Such predictions typically consider historical trends, event-by-event outcomes, athletes' past performances, etc. However, the unique conditions of every Olympic games, including home advantage in Paris for Europe, add an unpredictable factor.

Firstly, Pence's popularity has been declining since his vice presidency, and he has been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his response to the January 6th Capitol attack. Additionally, there are other potential candidates who could potentially challenge Pence for the nomination, such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley, among others.

Francis Suarez's current political profile: Francis Suarez is a current politician, serving as the Mayor of Miami. While he has gained attention for his progressive views on issues like climate change and social justice, his political experience and profile suggest he may have a strong foundation for a presidential run. 2. Republican Party dynamics: The Republican Party has been shifting towards the right in recent years, and some of the more moderate or progressive Republicans may face challenges in securing the nomination. However, the party has also shown a willingness to adapt and evolve, and a moderate candidate like Suarez could potentially appeal to a broad range of voters. 3. Primary competition: The Republican primary field for 2024 is still uncertain and may include a range of candidates. Suarez would need to compete against more established figures, including potential candidates like Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence. However, a well-funded and well-organized campaign could still allow Suarez to gain traction. 4. Delegates' preferences: The Republican National Convention is a complex process, and the delegates' preferences will play a significant role in determining the nominee. Suarez would need to build a coalition of delegates from various states and regions to secure the nomination. 5. Historical precedent: In recent years, the Republican Party has had a tendency to nominate candidates with strong grassroots support and a clear conservative or populist message. While Suarez's progressive views may not align with this trend, his charisma and leadership skills could still make him a compelling candidate. Considering these factors, while there are valid reasons to doubt Suarez's chances, I believe there is a non-negligible probability that he could secure the nomination.

While there have been rumors and speculations about Biden's intentions, there is no clear indication that he plans to step down. Biden has been in the position of President since 2021 and has not yet made any official announcements regarding his re-election bid. In fact, he has maintained a relatively consistent campaign presence, indicating that he intends to run for re-election. Another factor is that the resolution criteria for this question are quite specific, requiring an unambiguous and conclusive statement from Biden or his campaign. This makes it difficult to imagine a scenario where the question resolves as Yes without a clear and public announcement from the Biden campaign. Additionally, considering the timing of the question, it is likely that the Biden campaign has already made significant preparations for the 2024 election cycle. The fact that the question resolves on July 15, 2024, suggests that there is still a significant amount of time before the Democratic primary elections, which would be a critical period for the Biden campaign to announce their intentions.

Given this context, it is plausible that some Democratic politicians might feel the need to express their opinions or concerns about Biden's decision, especially if they have differing views on the party's direction or strategy. However, the key factor in this scenario is the requirement that at least 5 named individuals must work together to ask Biden to consider ending his campaign.

However, these instances are relatively rare and usually occur in response to significant events or controversies. Given the current context, there is no major controversy or event that would prompt a significant number of Senators to call for Biden to drop out.

While there may be some dissenting voices, it's unlikely that 10 or more Senators would publicly call for him to drop out before July 20.

While there is no direct causal link between US elections and Russian control of a specific location, it's possible that the dynamics of international relations and geopolitical tensions could be influenced by the outcome of the election.

This suggests that he intends to run for another term as President. However, there are some potential reasons why he might change his mind. For instance, his age (he will be 81 in 2024) and health concerns might make him consider stepping down. Additionally, the Democratic Party might prefer a younger candidate, and Biden might decide to step aside to allow a new face to emerge. Another factor to consider is the potential for a challenger within the Democratic Party. If a strong, popular candidate emerges, Biden might decide not to run in order to avoid a divisive primary. Lastly, we should consider the precedent set by Joe Biden's previous decisions. In 2015, he announced that he would not run for President in 2016, only to change his mind later. This suggests that he is capable of changing his mind, but it also shows that he tends to be cautious and deliberate in his decisions.

However, there are some hints and indicators that can be used to inform this probability assessment. One crucial factor is Joe Biden's age. At the time of the 2024 election, he would be 82 years old, which is relatively old for a president. This might make it more likely that he would choose not to run for re-election, as the demands of the presidency can be grueling, and his health may be a concern. Another factor is the Democratic Party's desire for a younger and more energetic candidate. The party may want to present a fresh face to the American people, which could lead to pressure on Biden to step aside.

The question then shifts to whether Joe Biden will announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President. To answer this question, we need to consider the likelihood of Joe Biden making such an announcement. There are a few possibilities to consider: 1. If Kamala Harris is not nominated as the Democratic VP, there is a chance that Joe Biden might decide not to run again, but without knowing this information, it's hard to estimate the likelihood of this scenario. 2. If Kamala Harris is nominated as the Democratic VP, it's less likely that Joe Biden would announce he won't accept the nomination, as he would have already chosen a running mate. 3. However, the question is asking about a specific announcement from Joe Biden or his campaign, which must be \"definitive, public, and official,\" and \"unambiguous and conclusive.\" This suggests that for the question to resolve as Yes, there needs to be a clear and intentional statement from Joe Biden or his campaign.

In this scenario, Kamala Harris would automatically become the President, as per the Presidential Succession Act. 2. Biden is temporarily unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office due to illness or injury, and the Vice President (Kamala Harris) is temporarily transferred power under the 25th Amendment. In this scenario, Kamala Harris would become the Acting President.

Firstly, for a swimmer to win the most gold medals, they would need to be competing in multiple events, as the Olympics feature a large number of swimmers competing in various events.

In the absence of explicit information about the qualification process and the relative performance of Georgia and Czechia in the Semi-finals, it is reasonable to assume that the qualification of one country does not directly affect the qualification of the other. Therefore, the probability of Czechia qualifying for the Grand Final if Georgia qualifies is equal to the probability of Czechia qualifying for the Grand Final regardless of Georgia's qualification status. The probability of a country qualifying for the Grand Final is typically around 10-15% for a country that does not have a strong track record in the competition. However, this probability can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances of the competition. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Czechia qualifying for the Grand Final if Georgia qualifies as around 12%."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "0f4f32fd-0038-4ef2-a62b-a4b2dd411eaf", "title": "Given Georgia fails to qualify for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, will Czechia qualify?", "body": "This conditional question explores the relationship between the qualification outcomes of Georgia and Czechia in Eurovision 2024.\n\nSuppose the following is true: Georgia does not participate in a Semi-final or is not officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

The condition states that Georgia must fail to qualify for the Grand Final, which means Georgia must not participate in a Semi-final or not be officially announced as having qualified. If this condition is met, we need to assess the likelihood of Czechia qualifying for the Grand Final. Since there is no explicit information about the relative performance or voting patterns of Georgia and Czechia, we can consider the general probability of a country qualifying for the Grand Final after failing to do so in a Semi-final. Typically, a country that fails to qualify for the Grand Final in a Semi-final has a relatively low probability of qualifying through the Jury or Public votes. However, this does not necessarily mean that Czechia will not qualify, as the voting process in Eurovision is complex and influenced by various factors such as public opinion, jury scores, and voting patterns. Given the lack of explicit information about Georgia's performance and the complex voting process, we can consider the general probability of a country qualifying for the Grand Final after failing to do so in a Semi-final. Assuming that Czechia's performance is average and not significantly better than Georgia's, we can estimate the probability of Czechia qualifying as follows: The probability of Czechia qualifying for the Grand Final is relatively low, but not negligible. We can estimate it as follows: The probability of Georgia failing to qualify for the Grand Final (condition met) is relatively high, given that the condition states that Georgia must not participate in a Semi-final or not be officially announced as having qualified.

Nvidia's growth has been driven by its dominance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, particularly for gaming and AI applications, as well as its increasing presence in the automotive and datacenter sectors.

Historically, Apple has maintained a larger market capitalization than Nvidia, but Nvidia has shown significant growth in recent years, especially in the fields of AI and computing. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and consistent revenue streams from its existing customer base have also contributed to its market capitalization staying relatively stable. To make an informed estimate, I'll consider the following: 1. Growth rates: Nvidia's growth rate in the AI and computing sectors is higher than Apple's, which could potentially close the gap in market capitalization. 2. Market trends: The increasing adoption of AI, gaming, and cloud computing could continue to drive Nvidia's growth, while Apple's growth might be more limited due to its existing market dominance in consumer electronics. 3.

The first condition deals with the political situation, specifically the number of Democratic House Members or Senators pressuring Biden to drop out. According to the provided information, there are already two safe-seat members who have publicly urged Biden out, and multiple drafts of letters are circulating among House Democrats. However, the market requires that fewer than five individuals be part of the same group message.

First, let's consider the women's 100m event, where Sha'Carri Richardson will compete. This event is one of the most prestigious and competitive events in track and field, with top athletes from around the world vying for the gold medal. While Sha'Carri Richardson is a talented sprinter, she will face stiff competition from other top athletes, including those from France and other top-ranked countries. In the women's 4x100m relay, the situation is similar, as the relay teams are typically composed of the fastest athletes from each country, and the competition is fierce. While Sha'Carri Richardson may be a key member of the US relay team, the outcome of the relay is difficult to predict, and there are many variables that can affect the team's performance. Given these considerations, it's difficult to assign a high probability to Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal in either event. However, we can still estimate the probability based on her past performance and the competitiveness of the events. Sha'Carri Richardson is a talented sprinter with a personal best time of 10.72 seconds in the 100m, which is one of the fastest times in the world. However, she has not yet demonstrated the ability to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games, and her performance in major competitions has been inconsistent. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal in the women's 100m event as around 0.05 (5%), and the probability of winning a gold medal in the women's 4x100m relay as around 0.10 (10%). These estimates are based on her past performance and the competitiveness of the events, and they reflect the difficulty of winning a gold medal in these events. Since the question asks for the probability of Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal in any event, we need to combine the probabilities of her winning a gold medal in the women's 100m and 4x100m relay events. Assuming independence between the two events, we can calculate the combined probability as follows: P(winning a gold medal) = P(winning a gold medal in women's 100m) + P(winning a gold medal in women's 4x100m relay) = 0.05 + 0.10 = 0.15.

However, in the absence of specific details on Lithuania's performance or voting dynamics in 2024, and given Azerbaijan's non-qualification (which does not inherently impede Lithuania's chances to qualify), a more theoretical assessment would suggest that it is not significantly less or more likely to qualify as compared to its typical patterns.

The presence of multiple strong candidates increases the likelihood of debates, as they provide an opportunity for candidates to differentiate themselves and gain traction. 3. Party rules and regulations: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) typically sets the rules for debates, including eligibility criteria and the number of debates. While the specifics are not provided in the question, it's likely that the DNC will continue to hold debates to facilitate a competitive and inclusive primary process. 4.

This suggests that the market is focused on the timing and confirmation of Biden's dropout. Given that the market resolves as N/A if President Joe Biden does not drop out before the end of the National Democratic Convention, we can infer that the market is contingent on Biden's dropout.

Donald Trump's current popularity: Trump's approval ratings have been volatile and have trended downward since his presidency. According to recent polls, his approval ratings are around 40-45%. This suggests that he may not have a strong base of supporters who would vote for him in a hypothetical election. 2. The generic Democrat's performance: In a generic matchup against Trump, a Democrat typically performs better than Trump. This is because the generic Democrat is a more palatable option for many voters who are dissatisfied with Trump. However, the performance of the generic Democrat is not well-defined, as it depends on the specific candidate. 3. The impact of the testimony: Trump's testimony at the hush money trial may have a significant impact on his popularity. If the testimony is credible and damaging to Trump's reputation, it could lead to a further decline in his popularity. On the other hand, if the testimony is seen as a partisan attack or is perceived as a witch hunt, it could boost Trump's popularity among his supporters. 4. The timing of the poll: The poll is scheduled to close on July 6, which is after the trial.

Additionally, the impact of the testimony on Trump's popularity is uncertain and may not be enough to boost his numbers by 3%.

Firstly, for Joe Biden to announce that he will not accept the Democratic nomination, he would need to be the presumptive nominee at that point. This means that the Democratic primary would have to have concluded, and Biden would have to have secured the necessary delegates to win the nomination. Given that Biden's announcement would be definitive, public, and official, it is likely that the Democratic Party would have already begun to coalesce around a new nominee. However, this does not necessarily mean that Ted Cruz would be the Republican nominee. The Republican primary process is complex and involves multiple factors, including the results of individual primaries and caucuses, the performance of candidates in debates and other events, and the preferences of party leaders and delegates. While it is possible that Ted Cruz could emerge as a strong contender for the Republican nomination, it is difficult to predict with certainty who the Republican nominee will be. However, if we assume that the Republican primary process is relatively unpredictable, and that multiple candidates could potentially emerge as front-runners, it is still possible that Ted Cruz could be selected as the Republican nominee.

First, it's essential to note that the number of traders in the linked market is a relatively small and specific event compared to the overall stock market performance. While a large number of traders may indicate a high level of interest or activity in the market, it's not a direct indicator of the stock market's performance.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment allows for the removal or denial of a person's right to hold federal office if they have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. This provision has been interpreted to apply to individuals who have supported or participated in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. There are several reasons why I think it is unlikely that Donald Trump will be removed from the primary election ballot: 1. Lack of concrete evidence: While there is ongoing debate about whether Trump's actions on January 6, 2021, constitute insurrection, there is no concrete evidence that would directly link Trump to the planning or execution of the attack. The House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack has made several recommendations for accountability, but these are not directly related to Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. 2. Legal hurdles: The process of removing or blocking a candidate from the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is complex and involves legal procedures that are not straightforward. State election officials and courts would need to agree that Trump's actions meet the criteria for removal, which is a high bar to clear. 3. Political considerations: Removing Trump from the ballot would be a highly political move, potentially sparking controversy and further polarization. State election officials and courts may be hesitant to take such a step, especially in the lead-up to the 2024 election. 4. Previous attempts at disqualification: There have been previous attempts to disqualify Trump from the ballot or otherwise prevent him from running, but these have been unsuccessful. This suggests that there may be a high threshold for removing him from the ballot. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Donald Trump being removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as of July 15, 2024, to be relatively low."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "dae057e6-a735-48b5-add4-79d055d4c5e7", "title": "Given Donald Trump is blocked from a primary election ballot under the 14th Amendment, will Biden drop out before July 20?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

This could significantly damage his public image and potentially harm his ability to rally support. However, it's also possible that Trump's base of supporters remains loyal, and his removal from the ballot might not directly affect Biden's decision to continue the race.\n\nMoreover, Biden's decision to drop out would depend on various factors, including his personal motivations, the state of the Democratic primary, and the potential impact on his party's chances in the general election. Without explicit statements or actions from Biden indicating his intention to drop out, it's challenging to assess the probability of this scenario.\n\nHowever, considering the hypothetical scenario where Trump is blocked from the ballot, it's plausible that Biden might feel less pressure to drop out, as Trump's removal could potentially weaken the Republican Party's chances in the general election. On the other hand, Biden might still choose to drop out if he feels that his campaign is struggling or if he believes that another candidate would be a stronger general election candidate.\n\nGiven this analysis, the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20 if Trump is blocked from the primary election ballot under the 14th Amendment is difficult to estimate precisely.

This could lead to a short-term shock to the economy, which might manifest as increased inflationary pressures. However, the impact of this event on inflation is uncertain and might be limited.

While there is no direct causal link between the two, I can use some general reasoning to make an educated estimate. Firstly, a higher volatility index typically indicates increased uncertainty or risk in the market. This could be due to various factors such as economic instability, geopolitical tensions, or other global events. In the context of a presidential election, increased market volatility might reflect voter uncertainty or anxiety about the future, which could favor a more charismatic candidate like Trump who often capitalizes on uncertainty and division. However, the relationship between market volatility and election outcomes is complex and can vary depending on the specific context. In this case, I will assume that increased market volatility on July 20, 2024, might slightly favor Trump's campaign, given his historical ability to capitalize on uncertainty and economic anxiety. Regarding the lead of Trump over Biden, a lead of > 2 and <= 3 points on July 15, 2024, is a relatively narrow margin. This could suggest that the election is still competitive and that either candidate has a chance to win. Given the assumption that increased market volatility might slightly favor Trump, I would estimate that this narrow lead is more likely to be in Trump's favor. However, this is still a speculative connection, and there are many factors that could influence the polling numbers, such as campaign events, debates, and voter turnout.

The first event is determined by historical data from the St. Louis Fed, while the second event is based on polling averages from 538.

The given condition about Trump's removal is specific to the U.S. states' primary election ballots for federal offices under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, and it does not directly influence the market capitalization of the tech companies. Nvidia's and Apple's market capitalizations are influenced by various factors such as their financial performance, product releases, industry trends, and investor sentiment. There is no apparent connection between Trump's removal from the primary election ballot and the market capitalization of these companies. Given the lack of a direct connection between the two, it is reasonable to assume that the market capitalization of Nvidia and Apple on July 17, 2024, will be determined by their individual company performances and market conditions, rather than by the condition about Trump's removal. Therefore, the probability of Nvidia's market capitalization being larger than Apple's on July 17, 2024, is independent of the condition about Trump's removal and is roughly equivalent to the probability of Nvidia's market capitalization being larger than Apple's in general.

If there are many candidates with a strong following and a chance of securing a significant number of delegates, it increases the likelihood of a brokered convention. On the other hand, if there are fewer candidates or a clear front-runner, it decreases the likelihood. Next, I'll consider the potential for a strong candidate not securing the necessary delegates in the first round. This could happen if a candidate's support is concentrated in a few states or if they face significant opposition from other strong candidates. Lastly, I'll evaluate the party's rules and the potential for a shift in the nomination process. Changes in the party's nomination process or a shift in the political landscape could impact the likelihood of a brokered convention. Given these considerations, I assess the situation as follows: There are currently several candidates in the Democratic primary, but none have a clear lead. Some candidates have strong support in specific regions, which could lead to a split of delegates.

One potential factor to consider is OpenAI's history of publicly acknowledging and addressing criticisms and risks associated with its products and services. For example, the company has engaged in public discussions about the ethics of AI development and the potential risks associated with advanced AI systems. This history suggests that OpenAI may be more likely to make a public commitment to a principle like 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure,' as it aligns with the company's apparent desire to be transparent and address concerns in a constructive manner. However, there are also potential reasons why OpenAI might not make such a commitment, including the company's need to maintain a certain level of control and secrecy in order to protect its intellectual property and competitive advantage.

The US women's basketball team, on the other hand, has been one of the most dominant teams in the world, winning seven of the last eight Olympic gold medals. They have a strong roster and a well-established system, which should give them a good chance of winning gold. Considering these factors, I believe that the US women's team has a higher chance of winning gold than the men's team.

ISS's voting history: ISS has a history of advising against executive compensation packages that are deemed excessive or not aligned with shareholder interests. Elon Musk's $57 billion package is likely to be scrutinized by ISS, given its size and potential impact on Tesla's financials. 2. Tesla's governance structure: Tesla has a relatively young and inexperienced board of directors, which may lead ISS to question the company's governance practices. Kimbal Musk's re-election may also be seen as a potential conflict of interest, given his familial relationship with Elon Musk. 3. ISS's recent statements: ISS has been increasingly vocal about the need for corporate boards to prioritize shareholder interests and ensure that executive compensation is reasonable. Given this trend, it's possible that ISS may advise against Elon Musk's package or Kimbal Musk's re-election. 4. Industry trends: There is a growing trend towards more shareholder-friendly corporate governance practices, which may influence ISS's recommendations. However, there are also factors that could mitigate the likelihood of ISS advising against Elon Musk's package or Kimbal Musk's re-election: 1. Tesla's financial performance: Tesla has been experiencing significant growth and has delivered strong financial results in recent years.

ISS's relationships with companies: ISS often has close relationships with companies, which can influence their recommendations. Tesla may have a strong relationship with ISS, which could lead to a more favorable recommendation. Given these factors, I estimate that the probability of ISS advising Tesla shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $57 billion package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk is around 60%.

I'll analyze the two components separately. First, for the condition (P), I consider the likelihood that ISS advises against Elon Musk's package or Kimbal Musk's re-election. This is a specific advisory scenario, and ISS is a proxy advisor that releases formal statements on such matters. Given the context of Elon Musk's pay package and Kimbal Musk's re-election, it's reasonable to assume that ISS has evaluated these proposals. I would assign a relatively high probability to ISS releasing an advisory statement, which resolves the condition (P). Second, for the outcome of interest (Q), I consider the likelihood that the linked market gets at least 377 traders by July 15. The market size is determined by the number of active traders in the linked market. This outcome is influenced by various factors, such as market conditions, the embedded market's characteristics, and user engagement. While I can't predict the exact market size, I would assume that the embedded market has some level of user engagement and activity. A market size of at least 377 traders by July 15 seems plausible, but it's also a specific target, which implies some uncertainty. Now, considering the conditional structure of the question, the probability of the linked market getting at least 377 traders by July 15 given that ISS advises against Elon Musk's package or Kimbal Musk's re-election is related to the joint probability of the two components. I would use a logical framework to break down the probability: Let P(P) be the probability that ISS advises against Elon Musk's package or Kimbal Musk's re-election (condition resolved YES). Let P(Q|P) be the probability that the linked market gets at least 377 traders by July 15 given that ISS advises against Elon Musk's package or Kimbal Musk's re-election. The joint probability is P(P and Q) = P(P) * P(Q|P). To estimate the conditional probability P(Q|P), I would need more information about the relationship between ISS's advisory statements and the market size of the linked market. Without such information, I'll make a rough estimate, assuming that the market size is somewhat independent of the ISS advisory. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of the condition (P) being resolved as around 0.6 (60% likelihood of ISS advising against either proposal). For the conditional probability P(Q|P), I would estimate around 0.4 (40% likelihood of the linked market getting at least 377 traders by July 15 given that ISS advises against either proposal). This is a rough estimate, considering the uncertainty around the market size and its dependence on various factors. Combining these probabilities using the logical framework, I get: P(P and Q) = P(P) * P(Q|P) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.

This lack of opposition could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for the parties involved, which might attract more traders to the market. However, the relationship between ISS's statements and the number of traders on a market is indirect and influenced by many other factors such as market trends, investor interest, and overall economic conditions. Therefore, while ISS's silence might be a positive signal, it is not a guarantee of a large number of traders.

However, without access to specific information about the athletes, events, and competition level for the 2024 Paris Olympics, it's challenging to make an accurate assessment. That being said, I can look at historical trends. In recent Olympics, the number of world records broken has varied. For instance, at the 2016 Rio Olympics, 17 world records were broken, while at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 27 world records were broken. These numbers suggest that the number of world records broken can fluctuate significantly from one Olympics to another. Given the uncertainty surrounding the specific factors that will influence the number of world records broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics, I'll consider a general trend. The number of world records broken has been increasing over the years, likely due to advancements in technology, training methods, and the overall quality of athletes.

Increased Participation and Presence: A strong showing in the top 5 means France will have a greater number of athletes participating and competing in various events, potentially increasing the chances for record-breaking attempts. 2. Competitive Rivalry and Pressure: Being among the top five can create a competitive edge and pressure among athletes. This environment can sometimes foster record-breaking attempts as competitors push themselves to excel against top-tier opponents. 3.

This investment might extend to facilities, coaching, and training methods that could contribute to athletes having the best possible conditions for record-breaking performances. 4. Psychological Effect: The psychological boost that comes with being part of a top-performing national team can also play a role. Athletes with the belief that they represent a strong nation might push themselves harder, leading to better performances and potentially world records.

First, we need to establish the likelihood of Donald Trump not being removed from any primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment as of July 15, 2024. Given the strict criteria for resolution (official state government announcements, court decisions, legal documentation, or credible media reports), it's reasonable to assume that without any such announcements or reports by July 15, 2024, Trump would not be removed. This seems like a low-risk scenario, as the question specifies that speculative reports or unofficial announcements will not suffice for resolution. Next, we consider the likelihood that on June 1, 2024, the ISW map shows Chasiv Yar under any categories indicating Russian control. This requires knowledge of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the status of Chasiv Yar as of June 1, 2024. Given that the question is asking about a specific date in the future (June 1, 2024) and the ISW map is a potential source of information, we must rely on available data and trends up to the resolution date (July 15, 2024). However, without access to real-time information or the ability to predict future events, we can only base our estimates on general knowledge and trends up to the resolution date. As of the resolution date, Chasiv Yar is a city in eastern Ukraine that has been affected by the conflict. The ISW map is a reliable source of information on the conflict, but its categories indicating Russian control are subject to change based on the evolving situation in Ukraine. Given the uncertainty surrounding the conflict and the potential for changes in the situation, it's challenging to provide a definitive estimate for the likelihood of Russia controlling Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024.

Firstly, Donald Trump's presidential nomination could lead to increased market volatility due to his unconventional and often unpredictable behavior, which may create uncertainty and anxiety among investors. This could result in higher volatility in the S&P 500 index. Secondly, Trump's presidency was marked by significant market volatility in the past, particularly during his first term. If he were to be re-elected, it's possible that similar market volatility could occur, which would be reflected in higher volatility indices like the VXVCLS. However, it's also important to consider that the current economic and market conditions may be different from those during Trump's previous presidency. The global economy has undergone significant changes since then, and the S&P 500 index has been influenced by various factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, monetary policy, and technological advancements.

Firstly, the impact of a non-Trump Republican nominee on the stock market and volatility is uncertain. However, if Trump is not the nominee, it could potentially lead to a decrease in market volatility as investors may perceive the Republican Party's stance as more moderate and less extreme. On the other hand, the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) is influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic indicators, monetary policy, and global events. The index has been relatively stable in recent years, and its year-over-year comparison on July 20, 2024, will depend on various market conditions. Given these considerations, it is difficult to make a definitive prediction about the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index's performance on July 20, 2024. However, if we assume that a non-Trump Republican nominee leads to a more stable market environment, it is possible that the volatility index might be lower than its previous year's value. However, the resolution criteria for the question only consider the year-over-year performance of the index, and do not take into account the absolute value of the index. Therefore, even if the index is lower than its previous year's value, it could still be higher than its previous year's value if the previous year's value was exceptionally low. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability that the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index will be higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024, given that Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee, to be around 0.6 or 60%.

Family Ties: As the son of former President Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. has a significant advantage due to his last name and the existing popularity of his father. This could potentially sway some delegates and voters. 2. Popularity and Name Recognition: Donald Trump Jr. has a well-established reputation within the Republican Party, which could make him a more attractive option for some delegates. 3.

As of my knowledge cutoff, Ted Cruz has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, but his popularity has varied over time. He has a dedicated base of supporters, but he also faces strong competition from other potential candidates. Secondly, the Republican National Convention is a complex process involving multiple delegates and voting rounds.

Given this complexity, it's challenging to predict the outcome with certainty. However, we can look at the history of past Republican National Conventions and the trends in the party's nominations. Historically, the Republican Party has had a tendency to nominate candidates who are more moderate or conservative than the average voter. Ted Cruz, being a conservative, might face challenges in securing the nomination if the party decides to opt for a more moderate candidate. On the other hand, Ted Cruz has a strong base of support among conservative voters, and he has performed well in past primary elections.

Firstly, the unavailability of ChatGPT in the EU is a separate event from Google DeepMind's publication of a report. However, it could be argued that the unavailability of ChatGPT might influence the likelihood of Google DeepMind publishing a report, as it might create a vacuum or opportunity for Google DeepMind to take the lead in publishing external red-teaming results, potentially increasing their visibility and credibility in the field. Given that OpenAI's ChatGPT is not generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, it's possible that Google DeepMind might see this as an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to safety and transparency, perhaps by publishing a report on their own external red-teaming efforts. However, this is speculative and there's no direct causal link between the two events. The likelihood of Google DeepMind publishing a report with external red-teaming results by June 30, 2024, is influenced by various factors such as their current research and development priorities, their commitment to safety and transparency, and the competitive landscape in the field of AI safety.

While it has focused on situations in Africa and other regions, it has also investigated and prosecuted cases involving non-state parties and individuals. 2. The nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: The conflict is a longstanding and complex issue, with both sides accusing each other of war crimes and human rights abuses. The ICC has been investigating the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 2009, and there have been reports of potential war crimes committed by both Israeli and Palestinian parties. 3. Recent developments: In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases involving Israeli officials being investigated or charged with war crimes, including the case of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert being investigated for war crimes in the 2002 Jenin refugee camp. However, these cases have been slow-moving and often stalled. 4.

However, the investigation has been slow to progress. 5. The ICC's jurisdiction: The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but only if the crimes were committed after July 1, 2002. Since the conflict in the Occupied Palestinian Territory began before this date, the ICC's jurisdiction is limited to crimes committed after 2002. Considering these factors, while there are valid reasons to believe the ICC might issue arrest warrants for some Israeli leaders, the process of issuing warrants is often slow and subject to various legal and political considerations.

Historically, some nations have dominated multiple sports at the Olympics. Next, we need to consider the outcome of an athlete winning more than one medal in tennis. This is a relatively common occurrence at the Olympics, as top tennis players often medal multiple times. However, the key here is the conditional probability.

In this case, I would argue that the occurrence of one nation winning multiple women's team sports would not have a significant impact on the likelihood of an athlete winning multiple medals in tennis.

Firstly, the 25th Amendment Section 4 provides a process for declaring a President unable to discharge their duties, but it's a formal and serious process that requires a majority of the Cabinet or other designated officials to agree on the President's incapacitation. This implies that there would need to be a significant concern about Biden's ability to perform his duties for a majority of the Cabinet to take such a drastic step. Secondly, the question specifies that there must be no ambiguity about Biden's intentions regarding the Democratic nomination. If he doesn't make a definitive public announcement, it's possible that he might still accept the nomination, which would likely alleviate any concerns about his ability to perform his duties. However, there are scenarios where Biden's health or cognitive abilities might become a concern, such as a public incident, medical diagnosis, or declining physical or mental performance.

The question resolves as 'No' if teams from eight different NOCs win gold in each of the eight team sports. Given that there are eight team sports and a large number of participating nations, it is unlikely that teams from eight different NOCs will win gold in each sport.

A more plausible scenario is that multiple NOCs will win gold in two or more sports, but no single NOC will win more than one sport. This would result in the question resolving as 'Yes'. To estimate the probability, we need to consider the number of possible outcomes and the likelihood of each outcome. Assuming that each NOC has an equal chance of winning each sport, we can use a binomial distribution to model the probability of a single NOC winning at least two sports. Using this approach, we can calculate the probability of a single NOC winning at least two sports as approximately 0.24.

This could potentially lead to a different campaign strategy and messaging, which might affect Trump's performance in the polls.

To approach this, we need to consider the rules and structure of the Eurovision contest. In Eurovision, participating countries are divided into two semi-finals, and the top 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the grand final. The allocation of countries to semi-finals is typically done randomly, but it's not explicitly stated that the allocation is random in the question. However, even if the allocation is not random, the EBU's rules state that a country's qualification for the grand final is based on their performance in their allocated semi-final.

However, the question states that Iceland is officially announced by the EBU as not having qualified for the grand final, which is a public and official announcement. This implies that the EBU has made a decision on the qualification of all countries, including Albania. Considering these points, the probability that Albania qualifies for the grand final given that Iceland fails to qualify is not directly related to Iceland's performance.

Firstly, I note that the question is about a specific date, July 15, 2024, which is over a year from now.

Currently, I am not aware of any specific information about the polling trends for the 2024 presidential election. However, I can consider the general trends from previous elections. In general, polling numbers can be volatile and can change significantly over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, new information about the candidates, and external events. Given the uncertainty in polling data and the potential for changes in voter sentiment and external events, I would expect Trump's lead over Biden to be within a relatively wide range on July 15, 2024.

A brokered convention typically occurs when no candidate has a majority of the delegates before the convention, leading to multiple rounds of voting. This can happen if there is a large field of candidates, a lack of a clear front-runner, and a complex delegate allocation system. In the 2024 US presidential election, the Democratic Party has a relatively large field of candidates, with over 20 individuals having expressed interest in running. This increases the likelihood of a brokered convention. Additionally, the delegate allocation system is complex, with multiple states having different allocation methods, which can lead to a situation where no candidate has a clear majority. However, there are also factors that could reduce the likelihood of a brokered convention. For example, some candidates may drop out early, potentially leading to a clearer front-runner.

In this scenario, it's likely that Biden's probability of winning the election would be higher than Trump's based on the FiveThirtyEight forecast on July 19, 2024.

However, there is no clear pattern or correlation between US presidential elections and the performance of the BSE SENSEX. Given the complex and uncertain nature of market trends, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction about the closing value of BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024. However, we can consider the general market trend and the fact that the question specifies a relatively narrow range (75k to 77k). As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the global economy was experiencing a slowdown, and the Indian stock market had shown volatility in recent years. However, the market has also shown resilience and adaptability in the face of uncertainty.

To estimate the probability of Georgia qualifying for the Grand Final, we need to consider the likelihood of these two conditions being met. Firstly, Georgia's participation in a Semi-final is a prerequisite for qualifying for the Grand Final. Given that Georgia has participated in Eurovision every year since its debut in 2007, it is reasonable to assume that they will participate in the 2024 edition as well. This suggests a high likelihood of participation in a Semi-final. However, the probability of qualifying for the Grand Final depends on the performance in the Semi-final. While we don't have specific information about Georgia's performance history in Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) typically selects the top 10-12 countries from each Semi-final to advance to the Grand Final. This means that the probability of qualifying for the Grand Final is contingent on Georgia's performance in the Semi-final. Considering these factors, I would estimate that Georgia's probability of qualifying for the Grand Final is around 60%.

However, the party has faced significant criticism from the EU for its handling of democratic norms, the rule of law, and human rights.

Thirdly, the European Parliament elections are often considered a second-order national election, meaning that they are less important than national elections and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the popularity of the ruling party, the state of the European economy, and the performance of the incumbent MEPs.

Firstly, the announcement of new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles may have a limited direct impact on the Hungarian electorate, as the country's automotive industry is relatively small and the tariffs may not significantly affect the prices of electric vehicles in Hungary. However, the tariffs could be seen as a protectionist measure that aligns with the Fidesz-KDNP's nationalist and Eurosceptic rhetoric, potentially boosting their popularity among Hungarian voters who are sensitive to issues of national sovereignty and economic protection.

Firstly, Poland's participation in the Semi-final is a necessary condition for qualifying for the Grand Final. Assuming that Poland has indeed participated in the Semi-final, the qualification for the Grand Final depends on the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announcing Poland as one of the qualifying countries. The EBU typically announces the qualifying countries after the Semi-finals have taken place, and this announcement is usually based on a combination of jury and public voting results. However, given that this is a question about a specific event (Poland qualifying for the Grand Final) that will be resolved on a specific date (May 7, 2024), and considering that the question resolution date is after the Semi-finals, it's reasonable to assume that the outcome of the Semi-finals is already known or will be known before the resolution date. Given the lack of information about Poland's performance in the Semi-finals, it's difficult to estimate the probability of Poland qualifying for the Grand Final. However, since the question implies that Poland's qualification is contingent on an official announcement by the EBU, which typically follows the voting process, we can infer that the probability of Poland qualifying is dependent on how well Poland performed in the Semi-finals. Since the specific details about Poland's performance are not provided, I will rely on general assumptions about the Eurovision format and voting process. In general, the qualification process for Eurovision involves a combination of jury and public votes, and the top countries from each Semi-final qualify for the Grand Final.

Without access to insider information or the EBU's selection process, it's challenging to estimate Denmark's chances of qualifying. However, we can consider general trends and past performances. Denmark has participated in Eurovision numerous times and has had varying degrees of success. Assuming a relatively competitive Semi-final, I would estimate Denmark's chances of qualifying as follows: 1. Denmark has a decent track record in Eurovision, with some successful entries in recent years. 2. The Semi-final will likely feature a mix of strong and weaker entries, making it difficult to predict the exact outcome. 3. The EBU's selection process is designed to ensure a diverse and engaging Grand Final, which may favor countries with unique styles or performances.

However, we can consider the overall distribution of qualifications in the semi-finals. In a typical Eurovision contest, a certain number of spots are reserved for the top scorers in each semi-final, and the remaining spots are allocated based on a combination of jury and public votes. If Denmark fails to qualify, it implies that the countries that did qualify must have scored higher than Denmark in the semi-final. This information does not provide any direct insight into Poland's chances of qualifying, as the qualification is determined by the overall ranking and not by the performance of a specific country. Given that the qualification process is independent and based on a complex voting system, it is reasonable to assume that the qualification of Poland is not directly influenced by Denmark's failure to qualify. However, we can consider the general trend that countries with a strong track record in the contest, such as Poland, tend to have a higher chance of qualifying.

The fact that 'Twisters' is a standalone sequel to the 1996 original suggests that the filmmakers are trying to create a new and distinct story while still honoring the spirit of the original. This could lead to a fresh and exciting take on the material. 4. However, it's worth noting that the original 'Twister' (1996) received mixed reviews from critics, with a Tomatometer score of 63%. This suggests that the franchise may not have a strong track record of critical acclaim. Considering these factors, I would estimate that the probability of 'Twisters' (2024) having a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of at least 75% is around 40%.

Firstly, the fact that two safe-seat members have already publicly urged Biden out and two of the most endangered Democrats have written off Biden's chances to win in November suggests that there is a significant level of dissatisfaction with Biden's candidacy within the Democratic Party. This could lead to a scenario where a group of at least 5 named Democratic lawmakers come together to ask Biden to drop out, which would be a clear signal to voters that Biden is not a viable candidate. Secondly, the fact that there are multiple drafts of letters circulating among House Democrats and at least one would call on Biden to end his campaign suggests that there is a coordinated effort to remove Biden from the ticket. This level of organization and planning increases the likelihood that a group of at least 5 named Democratic lawmakers will come together to ask Biden to drop out.

However, there are also some factors that suggest a lower probability of Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat. Firstly, the fact that the market requires a group of at least 5 named Democratic lawmakers to come together to ask Biden to drop out suggests that this is a high bar to clear. It is possible that such a group will not form, or that their efforts will not be successful in convincing Biden to drop out.

However, the Semi-final draw and the number of participating countries can affect both countries' performances. Given that the question specifies Czechia failing to qualify, it implies that the Semi-final draw and the number of participating countries are such that Czechia's performance is not sufficient to secure a spot in the Grand Final. In this context, it's likely that the Semi-final draw and the number of participating countries have a similar impact on both Czechia and Belgium's performances. If Czechia failed to qualify, it's possible that the Semi-final draw and the number of participating countries are not favorable to Belgium either.

Historical polling trends: In the 2020 presidential election, Trump's lead over Biden fluctuated throughout the campaign, but generally remained within a narrow range. It's possible that a similar trend could occur in 2024. 2. Current polling averages: As of the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), 538's national polling average shows a relatively small gap between Trump and Biden, with Trump leading by around 1-2 points. This suggests that the lead could potentially widen or narrow in the coming weeks. 3. Election season dynamics: The 2024 presidential election is still over a year away, and the campaign season has not yet reached its peak. This means that there may be significant events, debates, and controversies that could impact the polls and lead to changes in the lead. 4. 538's polling methodology: 538's national polling average is a weighted average of various polls, which helps to smooth out some of the noise and provide a more accurate representation of the national mood. However, it's still subject to the limitations of polling, including sampling errors and biases. 5. The specific date of July 15, 2024: The question asks about a specific date, which is about 6 months before the election.

Therefore, it's challenging to make a precise prediction about the exact lead on a specific date.

The condition provided in the question implies that Trump's lead is relatively stable, which might suggest that Biden's campaign is not doing well, and therefore, he might be less likely to have a high-profile interview. 2. However, the fact that the question is asking about an in-person interview lasting at least 45 minutes suggests that the outcome is not solely dependent on the current polling numbers. A high-profile interview can be a strategic move by the Biden campaign to improve his image or to counter Trump's lead. 3.

A couple of key considerations that should inform our estimation approach include: 1. Understanding that the dynamics of presidential races are typically marked by variability in polls that do not follow smooth curves or remain stable, particularly towards the latter part of election years. Thus, precise prediction for future lead figures could be fraught with errors unless based on rather weak prior information about current standings, polling accuracy trends for that source, historical variance around specific margins like a 3 to 4-point difference in U.S. presidential election races, or expectations regarding possible outcomes if Trump maintains significant campaign resources compared to the potential funding available to the opposition at the same juncture in their electoral races.

A brokered convention occurs when no candidate has secured the necessary number of delegates to win the nomination through the primary and caucus process, resulting in multiple rounds of voting at the convention. This can happen if there is a strong split among the party's factions, or if no clear front-runner emerges. Several factors suggest that a brokered convention is unlikely: 1. The 2024 Democratic primary has not yet begun, and many candidates have already announced their intention to run. This suggests that the party's factions are already mobilizing behind their preferred candidates. 2. The Democratic Party has a relatively large number of delegates, with a total of 4,763 delegates available for the 2024 convention. This makes it more difficult for a single candidate to secure the necessary number of delegates to win the nomination. 3. The Democratic Party has a history of nominating candidates who are well-established and well-funded, which reduces the likelihood of a brokered convention. However, there are also factors that suggest a brokered convention is possible: 1. The 2024 Democratic primary has the potential to be highly contested, with many strong candidates vying for the nomination. 2. The Democratic Party has a history of nominating candidates who are not necessarily the front-runner, but rather the candidate who is best able to unite the party. 3.

Firstly, Ted Cruz has been an active figure in the Republican Party, and his name has been floated as a potential candidate for the 2024 presidential election. However, his past presidential campaigns have been met with significant challenges, and his popularity within the party has waxed and waned over time. The Republican National Convention, which will ultimately determine the nominee, is a complex and unpredictable process. Delegates from each state will gather to cast their votes, and the outcome is influenced by a variety of factors, including party politics, voter sentiment, and the performance of other candidates. While it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of Ted Cruz being selected as the nominee, I can consider some general trends and statistics. In the 2020 Republican primary, the eventual nominee, Donald Trump, secured the nomination after a contentious primary season. However, other candidates, such as Ted Cruz, were also in the running.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) receives a CinemaScore of B or above, we need to consider the relationship between the two events. First, let's analyze the CinemaScore of M. Night Shyamalan's recent films. We have: 'Split' - B+, 'Glass' - B, 'Old' - C+, 'Knock at the Cabin' - C. This suggests that M. Night Shyamalan's films tend to receive a B or higher CinemaScore about 50% of the time (2 out of 4 films). Now, let's consider the IMDB ratings of 'House of the Dragon' episodes. We have: Season 1: E1-E10, Season 2: E1-E7 (E7 is unknown). The IMDB ratings seem to be highly variable, with some episodes receiving very high ratings (e.g., E7: 9.3) and others receiving much lower ratings (e.g., E6: 6.1). However, we can notice that the ratings tend to be higher for episodes that are closer to the end of the season. Given that S2E8 is the season finale, it's likely that it will receive a high rating, possibly above 8.5. However, we can't make a strong prediction based on the available data. Now, let's combine the two pieces of information. If M. Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) receives a CinemaScore of B or above, it suggests that the film is likely to be well-received by critics and audiences. This might lead to a positive buzz around the film, which could potentially influence the IMDB ratings of other popular TV shows, including 'House of the Dragon'. However, the relationship between the two events is not straightforward, and there are many factors that could influence the IMDB rating of S2E8. Therefore, I would estimate the probability that 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 will be rated >8.5 on IMDB, given that M. Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) receives a CinemaScore of B or above, as follows: Probability: 0.55"}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "594e38ac-f6a4-47cd-a52e-cf2099475668", "title": "Conditional on M.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) receives a CinemaScore of B- or lower, we need to consider the relationship between the two events. Firstly, the condition regarding 'Trap' is a prerequisite for the question to resolve YES or NO. If 'Trap' receives a B- or lower, we can proceed with analyzing the IMDB rating of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8. There is no direct evidence to suggest that the IMDB rating of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 is correlated with the CinemaScore of 'Trap'. However, we can make an educated guess based on general trends in cinema and audience behavior. A CinemaScore of B- or lower for 'Trap' might indicate that the film received negative reviews or was not well-received by audiences. This could lead to a negative sentiment towards M. Night Shyamalan's work, which might in turn affect the IMDB rating of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8. However, this is highly speculative and there is no concrete evidence to support this claim. Given the lack of direct correlation and the speculative nature of the relationship, I would argue that the probability of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 being rated >8.5 on IMDB, given that 'Trap' receives a B- or lower CinemaScore, is not significantly higher or lower than the baseline probability. Baseline probability: Assuming that the IMDB rating of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8 is not directly affected by the CinemaScore of 'Trap', we can estimate the baseline probability of the IMDB rating being >8.5. This would depend on various factors such as the general audience reception of the episode, the overall quality of the show, and the typical rating distribution for similar episodes. Without specific data on the IMDB ratings of previous episodes or the audience reception of 'House of the Dragon' S2E8, it is difficult to estimate a precise baseline probability. However, as a rough estimate, let's assume that the baseline probability of the IMDB rating being >8.5 is around 60-70%. Taking into account the speculative and indirect relationship between the two events, I would adjust the baseline probability downward to account for the uncertainty. A reasonable estimate for the conditional probability, given that 'Trap' receives a B- or lower CinemaScore, would be around 40-50%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.05901048343941956, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.01475262085985489, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.39788457530870924, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

First, the ongoing criminal investigation by the Fulton County District Attorney's office, led by Fani Willis, has been actively pursuing potential charges related to election interference, racketeering, and other crimes in connection with the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Given the scope and seriousness of these allegations, it's reasonable to infer that witness tampering charges could be a part of the DA's investigation. Additionally, the New York Attorney General's investigation into Donald Trump's business dealings, which has also led to the filing of charges against the former president, might lead to evidence that could be relevant to the Georgia case. If the Georgia prosecutors can make a compelling case that ties witness tampering to Donald Trump, the likelihood of charges increases. Another factor is the timing: June 1, 2024, is close enough to be a hard deadline for prosecutors to take action. This creates an incentive for the DA to bring charges before the date to maintain public momentum and to increase the pressure on Donald Trump and his team. However, the outcome of investigations can be difficult to predict and may take longer than expected.

Given that Malta fails to qualify, it does not necessarily mean that Croatia will qualify, as the qualification is based on the overall performance of each country. However, it is possible that Croatia's performance might be better than Malta's, which could lead to Croatia's qualification. Without more information about the performances of both countries, it is difficult to estimate the probability of Croatia qualifying. However, considering that the qualification is based on a competition, it is reasonable to assume that there is a certain level of uncertainty and randomness involved. Therefore, I will estimate the probability based on the assumption that the qualification is an independent event for each country."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.16808557114706094, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.042021392786765234, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.7132011819405477, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Meta's commitment to transparency and safety: Meta has been actively working on developing and deploying AI models, and has expressed a commitment to transparency and safety in their development and deployment. This suggests they may be likely to publish a report on external red-teaming results as a way to demonstrate their commitment to safety. 2. Red-teaming as a best practice: Red-teaming is a recognized best practice in the AI safety community, where external parties test and evaluate the security and safety of AI systems. Given the importance of this practice, it is likely that Meta would engage in it and publish the results if they were to do so. 3. Previous reports and publications: Meta has published various reports on their AI research and development, including safety-related topics. This suggests they are willing to share information about their work, which increases the likelihood of them publishing a report on external red-teaming results. 4. The time frame: The question asks for a report to be published by June 30, 2024. This is a relatively short time frame, which could limit the likelihood of a report being published, as it may not give Meta enough time to conduct the red-teaming, collect and analyze the results, and prepare the report for publication. 5. Lack of information about the specific model and red-teaming: The question does not specify which Meta model would be red-teamed or the identity of the external party conducting the red-teaming. This lack of specificity makes it harder to estimate the likelihood of a report being published. Considering these points, while there are reasons to believe Meta might publish a report on external red-teaming of their models, the lack of specificity and the short time frame make it a less certain outcome.

This might put pressure on other AI research organizations, including Meta, to follow suit and demonstrate their commitment to safety. Secondly, Meta has been actively involved in the development of AI safety measures, including the publication of reports on their red-teaming efforts. For example, in 2023, Meta published a report on the results of their internal red-teaming efforts. However, there are also reasons to be cautious. Meta and Anthropic are two separate organizations with different priorities, cultures, and timelines. Meta might not feel the same level of pressure to publish a report by June 30, 2024, especially if they are not as far along in their red-teaming efforts. Furthermore, the fact that the report needs to be published by a specific date might influence Meta's decision.
