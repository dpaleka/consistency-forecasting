The RBI has been maintaining a tight monetary policy stance to control inflation. 2. Inflation outlook: The RBI's primary mandate is to keep inflation within the target range of 2-6%. If inflation shows signs of sustained moderation by 2024, it could create room for rate cuts. 3. Global economic trends: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, can influence the RBI's decisions. 4. Domestic growth prospects: If India's economic growth shows signs of slowing down in 2024, it might prompt the RBI to consider rate cuts to stimulate the economy. 5. Time horizon: The question allows for almost 18 months from the creation date to the resolution date, which is a considerable time for economic conditions to evolve. 6.

Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut by December 2024. The extended time frame allows for potential changes in economic conditions that could necessitate a rate cut. However, the RBI's cautious approach and the current focus on inflation control suggest that a rate cut is not highly likely. If inflation shows a consistent downward trend and growth concerns emerge in 2024, the probability of a rate cut would increase.

This is a very short timeframe for a major infrastructure project, especially one involving new technology. 2. Complexity: Drone delivery projects are technologically complex and require significant planning, regulatory approval, and infrastructure development. This includes setting up launch and landing sites, developing flight paths, ensuring safety measures, and integrating with existing systems. 3. Regulatory hurdles: Drone delivery projects face significant regulatory challenges. The FAA has strict rules about drone operations, especially for commercial purposes. Obtaining necessary approvals can be a lengthy process. 4. Tribal involvement: While Native American tribes have some sovereignty, they still need to work within federal regulations for airspace. The involvement of the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas might add unique considerations or potential delays due to tribal governance processes. 5. Lack of prior information: As of the question creation date, there's no mention of this project being in advanced stages or nearing completion. If it were close to completion, we would likely have heard about it earlier. 6. Precedent: Large-scale drone delivery projects are still relatively rare and often face delays. Even major companies like Amazon and Google have faced challenges in implementing such systems. 7. Rural setting: The Kickapoo reservation in Texas is in a rural area, which might present additional challenges in terms of infrastructure and connectivity. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the first phase of this project could be completed within just 6 months, especially considering the lack of prior information about its progress. The short timeline, combined with the complexity of drone delivery systems and potential regulatory hurdles, makes it improbable that the project will be completed by December 2024. However, we should allow for the possibility that significant progress had been made before the question was created, or that the 'first phase' might be more limited in scope than a full-scale delivery system.

Collaborations between jazz artists and pop stars (like Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett) might have a chance, but these are infrequent. 5.

Current financial health of Canara Bank: As of now, there are no major public reports indicating severe financial distress or regulatory concerns about Canara Bank. It is one of the larger public sector banks in India and has generally maintained a stable position. 2. RBI's regulatory approach: The RBI has been known to take proactive measures to maintain the stability of the banking sector. However, it typically imposes bank-specific curbs only when there are significant issues with a bank's operations, asset quality, or compliance. 3. Recent regulatory actions: There haven't been any recent reports of the RBI imposing significant curbs on major public sector banks like Canara Bank. The focus has been more on overall sector regulations rather than bank-specific actions. 4. Time frame: The question allows for a relatively short time frame (about 14 months from the creation date to the resolution date). This reduces the likelihood of major issues developing and resulting in regulatory action, unless there are already underlying problems not yet public. 5. Economic conditions: India's banking sector has been relatively stable recently, with improvements in non-performing asset (NPA) ratios. Unless there's a sudden economic downturn, it's less likely for a major bank to face severe regulatory action. 6. Specificity of the question: The question requires the curbs to be specifically targeted at Canara Bank's lending practices, not general regulations. This makes a positive resolution less likely, as broad regulatory changes are more common than bank-specific ones. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the RBI would impose new regulatory curbs specifically on Canara Bank's lending by August 2024.

The state's history of attempting to pass strict abortion laws, combined with the conservative makeup of the legislature and the current national legal landscape regarding abortion rights, makes this scenario quite likely. However, potential public pushback and the possibility of legal challenges introduce some uncertainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Time frame: The question is asking about a referendum by December 2024, which is about 18 months from the creation date of this question. This is a relatively short time frame for organizing a state-wide referendum, especially on a complex issue like education reform. 3. Historical precedent: Georgia doesn't have a strong history of using referendums for major policy changes, particularly in education. Most education policies are typically handled through the legislative process. 4. Lack of current discussion: As of the creation date of this question, there doesn't appear to be any significant public or political discussion about holding a referendum on education reform in Georgia. 5. Complexity of education reform: Education reform is a complex and often contentious issue. Preparing a comprehensive reform package that would be suitable for a referendum would likely take considerable time and political negotiation. 6. Legislative calendar: The Georgia General Assembly typically meets for 40 legislative days each year, usually between January and April. This limits the window for passing legislation to set up a referendum. 7. Potential for other priorities: Given various economic, social, and political issues, education reform may not be at the top of the legislative agenda, especially to the point of warranting a state-wide referendum. 8. Potential resistance: Any major education reform is likely to face resistance from various stakeholders, including teachers' unions, school boards, and different political factions, which could delay or prevent a referendum from being organized.

Recent trends: Both countries have been seeking to diversify their international partnerships in recent years.

Areas of potential cooperation: There are several areas where Italy and Australia could potentially collaborate, such as renewable energy, space technology, or cultural exchanges. Both countries have strengths in these areas that could complement each other. 5.

Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high probability that Rapinoe will resume on-field training by August 2024: - The time frame allows for a full recovery and rehabilitation, even if progress is slower due to her age. - Even if she doesn't plan to return to professional play, engaging in on-field training could be part of a complete rehabilitation process to regain full functionality. - Her public profile increases the likelihood that such information would be reported and confirmed by reputable sources. - The specificity of 'on-field training as part of rehabilitation' rather than 'return to competitive play' lowers the bar for what constitutes a positive resolution. However, there are factors that could prevent this from happening: - She might choose not to pursue full rehabilitation if she has truly retired from all forms of competitive play. - There could be complications in her recovery process. - She might complete her rehabilitation process before August 2024, making it less likely for her to still be in a formal rehab program by that time.

AI-focused reorganization: Slack announced an AI-focused reorganization plan in 2023, which suggests that the company is pivoting towards more AI-driven solutions.

For example, the COVID-19 PHEIC lasted from January 2020 to May 2023 (over 3 years), while the Zika virus PHEIC lasted about 9 months. 3. Progress in controlling mpox: Since the outbreak began, there has been significant progress in controlling the spread of mpox.

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance of this question resolving as YES. The significant number of potential recipients and the allocated funding suggest that reaching 20,000 recipients is feasible. However, administrative challenges and potential legal obstacles could slow down the process. The time frame of just over a year is somewhat tight for such a large-scale program, but not impossible. The USDA has experience with similar programs and may be able to expedite the process given the political importance of addressing historical discrimination.

Project complexity: Drone delivery systems are complex and involve multiple components, including the drones themselves, control systems, landing sites, and regulatory approvals. Implementing such a system for the first time in a tribal area adds another layer of complexity. 3. Regulatory hurdles: Drone delivery projects often face significant regulatory challenges. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has strict rules governing drone operations, especially for commercial purposes. Obtaining necessary approvals could be time-consuming. 4. Tribal context: The Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas is a relatively small tribe with limited resources. While they may have partners or funding for this project, implementing a large-scale technological initiative could be challenging for a small tribal government. 5.

Economic outlook: The U.S. economy has been showing signs of resilience despite high inflation and interest rate hikes. However, there are concerns about a potential recession in the near future. 3.

Historical context: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, weekly jobless claims were often below 250,000, indicating that this level is achievable in a strong economy. 6. Federal Reserve policies: The Fed's actions to combat inflation could lead to a slowdown in hiring, potentially increasing jobless claims. Given these factors, I believe there is a good chance that the average weekly jobless claims will fall below 250,000 for at least one month by August 2024. The current levels are already close to this threshold, and the extended time frame increases the likelihood of at least one month meeting this criteria, even if there are fluctuations in the economy.

In 2020, they endorsed Joe Biden in April, well before the July timeframe we're considering. 2. Timing of the election cycle: July 2024 is relatively late in the primary season and close to the general election. By this time, both major parties will likely have their nominees determined, making it a logical time for unions to make endorsements. 3. Current political climate: The UAW has been vocal about labor issues and has recently conducted significant strikes. This suggests they are likely to be politically engaged and interested in influencing the presidential race. 4. Potential candidates: If Joe Biden runs for re-election, the UAW may be inclined to endorse him early, given their previous support. If there's a competitive Democratic primary, they might wait to see how candidates position themselves on labor issues. 5. Union strategy: The UAW might see an early endorsement as a way to maximize their influence on the candidates' platforms and policy positions. 6. Recent union activism: The successful strikes and negotiations in 2023 have increased the UAW's profile and potentially their desire to play a role in national politics. 7. Time constraint: The question gives the UAW a full year from the creation date to make an endorsement, which is ample time for deliberation and decision-making. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that the UAW will make an endorsement by July 2024.

While they didn't go as far as a public transit-only policy then, they might have learned lessons that could inform a more ambitious approach for 2026. 5. Time frame: The question allows for over a year from the creation date to the resolution date, which provides ample time for planning and announcing such a policy. 6. Potential challenges: Implementing a strict public transit-only policy might face resistance from some stakeholders, including VIPs, sponsors, and local businesses who might prefer private vehicle access. 7. Russian government's approach: The Russian government has shown a willingness to implement large-scale projects and policies for major events, often with a focus on showcasing the country's capabilities. 8. International trends: Other cities hosting major sporting events have implemented similar policies, which could influence Moscow's decision. While there are compelling reasons for Moscow to implement such a policy, it's also a significant step that goes beyond what most host cities typically do.

Comparison to other states: States that have fully expanded Medicaid have seen significant enrollment numbers, often exceeding 300,000 within the first year or two of implementation. 6. Political and administrative factors: The success of enrollment often depends on outreach efforts, ease of application process, and political support for the program. Given these factors, I believe that while 300,000 enrollees is a substantial number, it may be challenging for Georgia to reach this target by July 2024 due to: a) The limited nature of their expansion program compared to full expansion in other states. b) Potential barriers like work requirements that might slow down enrollment. c) The relatively short timeline from the program's implementation to the resolution date. However, there are also factors that could drive enrollment: a) Pent-up demand for health coverage among low-income adults. b) Possible adjustments to the program to increase enrollment if initial numbers are low. c) Potential changes in federal policy or incentives that could encourage broader expansion. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of reaching the 300,000 enrollment target, but it's not highly likely given the current structure of Georgia's program and the timeline."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "0e0e98dd-2bdd-438a-ac36-c37c3e5acf33", "title": "Will Georgia's Medicaid expansion program enroll over 300,000 people by December 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if Georgia's Medicaid expansion program has enrolled more than 300,000 residents by December 31, 2024.

Current status: Georgia's Medicaid expansion program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, launched on July 1, 2023. This gives the program approximately 18 months to reach the 300,000 enrollment target by December 2024. 2. Eligibility criteria: The program is a limited expansion, covering adults aged 19-64 who earn up to 100% of the federal poverty level and meet work or community engagement requirements. This is more restrictive than full Medicaid expansion, which typically covers individuals up to 138% of the poverty level without work requirements. 3. Potential enrollment pool: According to estimates, around 400,000 to 500,000 Georgians could potentially be eligible for coverage under a full Medicaid expansion. However, due to the more restrictive nature of Georgia's program, the actual eligible population is likely smaller. 4. Enrollment pace: As of early 2024, reports indicated that enrollment in the program was slow, with only about 1,300 people enrolled after six months. This slow start can be attributed to the program's unique requirements and potential lack of awareness among eligible individuals. 5. Outreach and awareness: The success of the program will depend heavily on outreach efforts and raising awareness among potential beneficiaries. If the state increases its efforts in this area, enrollment could accelerate. 6. Political climate: Georgia's program is a compromise between full Medicaid expansion and no expansion. The political landscape could affect the program's implementation and promotion. 7. Economic factors: Changes in the economy could impact the number of people eligible for the program, as it's tied to income levels. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the program will reach 300,000 enrollees by December 2024. The slow start, restrictive eligibility criteria, and the short timeframe are significant obstacles. Even with increased outreach efforts, it would require an enormous acceleration in enrollment rates to reach 300,000 in less than a year. However, there is still a possibility of reaching this goal if the state significantly ramps up its efforts, simplifies the enrollment process, or if economic conditions lead to more people becoming eligible. Additionally, if the program proves successful, there might be political pressure to expand it further, potentially increasing enrollment. Considering all these factors, I estimate a low probability of the program enrolling over 300,000 people by December 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.08353693220682654, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04176846610341327, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4118331129111585, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Time frame: The question gives about 18 months for Fisker to secure these grants, which is a relatively short period for such a large amount. 5. Amount of grants: $500 million is a substantial sum, even in the context of government grants for the automotive industry. It would likely require multiple grant approvals or one very large grant. 6. Fisker's current grant status: As of now, I'm not aware of any major grants that Fisker has already secured towards this goal, which means they would need to start from scratch. 7. Political and economic factors: Changes in administration or economic conditions could affect the availability and distribution of such grants. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely but not impossible for Fisker to receive over $500 million in grants by December 2024. The company would need to make significant progress in its operations and present compelling proposals to secure such large grants in a relatively short time frame. While the government is supportive of EV initiatives, the competition for these funds is intense, and Fisker is not currently one of the leading players in the EV market. However, the possibility cannot be completely ruled out. If Fisker manages to demonstrate exceptional potential or aligns closely with specific government initiatives, they could potentially secure substantial funding."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The repo rate was increased several times in 2022 and early 2023. 3. Global economic outlook: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, can influence SARB's decisions. 4. Time horizon: The question allows for a considerable time frame (until December 2024), which increases the likelihood of economic conditions changing. 5. Inflation expectations: If inflation shows signs of sustainably decreasing towards the target range, it could prompt the SARB to consider rate cuts. 6. Economic growth concerns: If economic growth remains sluggish or declines, there might be pressure to cut rates to stimulate the economy. Given these factors, there's a moderate chance of a rate cut by December 2024. The extended time frame allows for potential changes in economic conditions. If inflation begins to moderate and economic growth concerns persist, the SARB might consider easing its monetary policy. However, the SARB is known for its cautious approach and commitment to price stability. They would likely want to see clear evidence of sustained lower inflation before cutting rates. Considering the current high inflation environment and recent rate hikes, an immediate rate cut seems unlikely. But over the 18-month period until December 2024, there's a reasonable chance economic conditions could change sufficiently to warrant a rate cut."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This is a significant amount of time for investigators to uncover new evidence or expand their investigation. 3. Nature of white-collar crime: Procurement fraud often involves complex schemes that can span multiple transactions or years. As investigations progress, it's not uncommon for additional charges to be uncovered. 4. Precedent in similar cases: In many high-profile white-collar crime cases, initial charges are sometimes followed by additional charges as investigations deepen. 5. Scrutiny on government officials: Given Parker's position as a government official, there may be increased scrutiny and public pressure to thoroughly investigate all aspects of his conduct. 6. Potential for plea bargains: If Parker is cooperating with investigators, this could lead to the discovery of additional criminal activities, resulting in new charges. 7. Resources allocated to the case: The fact that Parker is a government official might mean more resources are dedicated to the investigation, increasing the likelihood of uncovering additional crimes. 8. Requirement for distinct charges: The question specifies that new charges must be distinct from the original counts, which sets a higher bar for a YES resolution. 9. Need for official filing and reporting: The requirement for official filing and reporting by two reputable sources adds another layer of certainty to any potential new charges. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high chance of additional charges being filed. The existing fraud case suggests a pattern of misconduct that could extend beyond the current charges. The extended time frame allows for a thorough investigation, and the high-profile nature of a government official's case may lead to increased scrutiny.

Given these factors, reaching 12,500 points is certainly possible but not guaranteed.

Historical performance: As of June 2023, the SMI index is trading around 11,300 points. The all-time high for the index was about 12,900 points in August 2021. This shows that reaching 12,500 is within the realm of possibility. 2. Time frame: The question gives an 18-month window (July 2023 to December 2024) for the index to reach the target. This is a relatively long period, increasing the chances of hitting the mark. 3. Economic factors: Switzerland has a stable and robust economy, which generally supports its stock market. However, global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and potential recessions in major economies, could impact the Swiss market. 4. Monetary policy: The Swiss National Bank has been tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, which could potentially slow economic growth and stock market performance. 5. Global market sentiment: The performance of global markets, especially in Europe and the US, can influence the SMI. Any significant rallies in these markets could lift the SMI as well. 6. Intraday highs: The question specifies that intraday highs count for resolution, which increases the likelihood of reaching the target compared to if only closing prices were considered. 7. Sector performance: The SMI is heavily weighted towards defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples, which tend to perform well during economic uncertainties. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to good chance of the SMI reaching 12,500 points by December 2024. The index needs to gain about 10% from its current levels to reach the target, which is achievable over an 18-month period. The fact that intraday highs count and the relatively long time frame increase the probability. However, economic uncertainties and tightening monetary policies could pose challenges. The target is also close to the all-time high, which might provide some resistance. Considering all these factors, I would estimate the probability as follows: Probability: 0.65 This suggests that while it's more likely than not that the SMI will reach 12,500 points by December 2024, there is still a significant chance it may not due to various economic and market factors."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical context: The 2017 Catalan independence referendum was highly controversial and led to significant legal and political repercussions. Spain's actions during and after the referendum have been criticized by some international bodies and human rights organizations. 3. Ongoing legal challenges: There have been various legal challenges related to the referendum, both within Spain and in international courts. Some cases are still pending in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). 4. International court proceedings: International courts, particularly the ECHR, often take years to reach decisions on complex political cases. The short timeframe makes it less likely for an international court to issue a ruling within this period. 5. Spanish domestic courts: It's highly unlikely that Spanish domestic courts would rule against the central government on this issue, given the strong stance taken by the Spanish judiciary on the illegality of the referendum. 6. Recent developments: In July 2021, the Council of Europe called on Spain to release Catalan separatist leaders, reform its laws on rebellion and sedition, and drop extradition proceedings against Catalan politicians living abroad. This suggests ongoing international concern about Spain's handling of the issue. 7. Precedent: While there have been criticisms of Spain's actions, there haven't been any major court rulings against Spain regarding the referendum so far, which might indicate a lower likelihood of such a ruling in the near future.

The Phase 3 trial results, published in November 2022, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in clinical decline. 3. Safety profile: While the drug has shown efficacy, there have been concerns about side effects, particularly amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). However, these side effects are generally manageable with proper monitoring. 4. EMA approval process: The EMA typically takes 12-18 months to review and approve new drugs.

Nuclear power offers a stable, low-carbon energy source. 4. Climate goals: Sweden has ambitious climate goals, aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2045. Nuclear power can play a significant role in achieving these targets while maintaining energy security. 5. Public opinion: While there has been historical opposition to nuclear power in Sweden, public opinion has been shifting in favor of nuclear energy in recent years, particularly due to concerns about energy security and climate change. 6. Economic factors: The decision to build additional reactors would require significant financial investment. The government would need to be confident in the economic viability of such projects. 7. Time constraints: The question specifies a relatively short timeframe (by July 2024). While policy decisions can be made quickly, announcing plans for additional reactors beyond the two already planned might require more time for feasibility studies and planning. 8. International context: Other European countries, such as France and the UK, have also been expanding their nuclear programs, which could influence Sweden's decision. Given these factors, there is a reasonable chance that Sweden might announce plans for additional reactors. However, the short timeframe and the fact that two reactors are already planned make it less likely that they would announce even more reactors so soon. Probability: 0.35 The probability of 0.35 reflects that while there are several factors supporting the possibility of additional reactor announcements, the short timeframe and the recent commitment to two new reactors make it less likely than not.

In May 2023, the average weekly jobless claims were around 1.5 million. 2. Economic recovery: The UK economy has been recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are still challenges such as inflation and potential recession risks. 3.

Given these considerations, it seems highly unlikely that the average weekly jobless claims in the UK will fall below 100,000 for any month by December 2024. Here's why: - The current level is still significantly higher than the target of 100,000. - While the economy is recovering, reaching such a low level of jobless claims would require an unprecedented and rapid improvement in the job market. - Historical data suggests that even in times of strong economic performance, the UK hasn't seen jobless claims this low. - The time frame, while allowing for some improvement, is likely not sufficient for such a dramatic change. - Economic uncertainties and potential global challenges could hinder rapid job market improvements.

Existing climate policies: New York has already enacted significant climate legislation, such as the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in 2019. This reduces the immediate need for a referendum on the issue. 6. Logistical challenges: Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex and costly process, which makes it less likely to occur without a compelling reason or strong public demand. 7. COVID-19 impact: The ongoing pandemic and its aftermath may continue to affect political priorities and the feasibility of organizing large-scale public votes. 8. Alternative approaches: It's more likely that New York will continue to address climate change through legislative action, executive orders, and agency regulations rather than a public referendum. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that New York will hold a referendum on climate change policy by August 2024.

Current political climate: While climate change is a significant issue, there's no indication that New York is currently planning a specific referendum on this topic.

Timeframe: The period from now (June 2024) to August 2025 is relatively short for organizing a statewide referendum, especially on a complex issue like climate change policy. 4. Legislative process: In New York, referendums typically need to be approved by the state legislature before being put to a public vote. This adds an additional hurdle and time requirement. 5. Alternative policy-making methods: New York has been proactive in addressing climate change through traditional legislative and executive actions, which may be seen as more efficient than a referendum. 6. Public interest: While there is growing concern about climate change, it's not clear if there's enough public demand for a specific referendum on this issue in New York. 7. Costs and logistics: Organizing a statewide referendum is a significant undertaking in terms of cost and logistics, which might discourage such an action, especially if other methods of policy-making are available. 8. Potential for local referendums: While the question specifies a statewide referendum, it's worth noting that local referendums on climate-related issues might be more likely, but these would not satisfy the criteria for a 'yes' resolution. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that New York will hold a statewide referendum specifically on climate change policy by August 2025.

Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is only one month after the question was created. This is a relatively short period for a full recovery from a significant injury. 3. Messi's age and career stage: By July 2024, Messi will be 37 years old. At this age, recovery times can be longer, and injuries might be more frequent or severe. 4. Type of activity: The question specifically asks about running as part of rehabilitation, which is often an early stage in recovery for many sports injuries. 5. Messi's importance: As one of the world's most famous and valuable players, his medical team would likely be very cautious and thorough in his rehabilitation process. 6. Information availability: The question requires confirmation from official sources or reputable outlets, which are likely to report on Messi's recovery progress given his high profile. Considering these factors, I believe there's a relatively high chance that Messi will resume running as part of his rehab by July 2024: - Running is often an early stage of rehabilitation for many injuries, making it likely to occur within a month if the injury isn't extremely severe. - Given Messi's status, his recovery is likely to be closely monitored and reported on, increasing the chances of confirmation if he does resume running. - However, the short timeframe and lack of information about the specific injury introduce some uncertainty."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "1d0f4000-ac40-44a2-9aa9-bde16cec282a", "title": "Will Lionel Messi resume running as part of his rehab by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by August 31, 2024, it is confirmed that Lionel Messi has resumed running as part of his rehabilitation process following an injury.

Current state of weight loss medications: The weight loss drug market has seen significant advancements in recent years, with medications like Wegovy and Ozempic gaining popularity. However, these are injectable medications, not nasal sprays. 2. Development timeline: Developing a new drug and getting FDA approval typically takes many years. The question is asking about availability by August 2024, which is only about 14 months from the creation date of this question. This is a very short timeframe for a new drug to be developed, approved, and made available in pharmacies. 3. Existing research on nasal sprays for weight loss: While there has been some research into nasal sprays for weight loss, such as oxytocin nasal sprays, none have yet received FDA approval for this specific use. 4. FDA approval process: The FDA approval process is rigorous and time-consuming. Even if a nasal spray for weight loss is currently in late-stage clinical trials, it would be challenging to complete the process and have the product available in pharmacies within 14 months. 5. Manufacturing and distribution: Even after FDA approval, it takes time to scale up manufacturing and establish distribution channels to major pharmacy chains. 6. Market demand: There is significant demand for effective weight loss treatments, which could potentially accelerate the process if a promising nasal spray were developed. However, this factor alone is unlikely to overcome the other time constraints. 7. Lack of current news or announcements: If such a product were close to approval and market availability, it would likely be generating buzz in the medical and pharmaceutical communities. The lack of such news suggests that no nasal spray for weight loss is in the late stages of development or approval. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that an FDA-approved nasal spray for weight loss will be available in U.S. pharmacies by August 2024.

This establishes a baseline of existing products that meet the criteria. 2. Time frame: The question asks about availability by August 2024, which is about two months from the creation date of the question. This is a relatively short time frame for new drug approvals, but it's sufficient for existing approved products to remain on the market or for recently approved products to become available. 3. FDA approval process: The FDA approval process for new drugs typically takes several years. However, this question isn't limited to new approvals; it includes any FDA-approved nasal spray for any purpose. 4. Market demand: Nasal sprays are common and widely used products, so there's ongoing demand and incentive for manufacturers to keep these products available. 5. Pharmacy chains: The question specifically mentions major U.S. pharmacy chains like CVS, Walgreens, or Rite Aid. These chains typically stock a wide range of over-the-counter and prescription nasal sprays. 6. Broad criteria: The question allows for nasal sprays approved for any purpose, which increases the likelihood of a positive resolution. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that at least one FDA-approved nasal spray will be available in U.S. pharmacies by August 2024. The existing market for nasal sprays, the broad criteria of the question, and the relatively short time frame all contribute to a high probability of a YES resolution.

This significant time lapse makes it less likely for a lawsuit to be filed, as most pandemic-related legal actions tend to occur closer to the events in question. 2. Statute of limitations: While the exact statute of limitations for such a case in Florida would need to be verified, many civil actions have a limitation period of 2-4 years. By 2025, the speedway might be beyond the timeframe to file a lawsuit related to 2020 events. 3.

However, without knowing about any significant events between the creation date and now, it's hard to gauge public sentiment. 5. Legislative process: Referendums in California can be initiated by the state legislature or through citizen initiatives. The latter requires collecting a significant number of signatures, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. 6. Opposition: The gun rights lobby is strong in the United States, and they would likely mount significant opposition to any proposed gun control referendum. 7. Existing gun control laws: California already has comprehensive gun control laws. This might reduce the perceived need for additional measures through a referendum. 8. Political priorities: Given other pressing issues like the economy, housing, and climate change, gun control might not be the top priority for a referendum in this time frame.

Current political climate: California has a Democratic supermajority in both houses of the state legislature and a Democratic governor. This makes it easier to pass gun control measures through normal legislative channels without resorting to a referendum. 3.

For smaller companies and 14- and 15-year-old workers, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. 2. Scheduled increases: Ohio's minimum wage is tied to inflation and is adjusted annually.

Fast food workers' wages: The question specifically asks about fast food workers, who are typically paid at or slightly above the minimum wage. The current minimum wage for fast food workers in Ohio is not explicitly stated to be $11 per hour, so we must assume this is a hypothetical scenario or a recent change. 4.

Economic factors: Inflation and economic conditions could potentially influence wage decisions, but given the short time frame, it's unlikely that there would be significant pressure to reduce wages. 6.

Given these factors, it seems highly likely that Ohio would maintain an $11 per hour minimum wage for fast food workers through July 2024 if that is indeed the current rate.

In 2021, they experienced a major breach affecting millions of customers, which led to a $350 million settlement. However, this was not a direct payment to hackers. 2. Company policy: Large corporations like T-Mobile typically have policies against paying ransoms or hackers, as it can encourage further attacks and may be seen as funding criminal activities. 3. Legal and regulatory environment: Paying hackers is often discouraged by law enforcement and cybersecurity experts. Companies are usually advised to work with authorities rather than give in to demands. 4. Transparency: T-Mobile has shown some level of transparency in the past by disclosing breaches. However, publicly confirming a payment to a hacker would be an unusual step for any major corporation. 5.

Global trend: Globally, mpox cases have been declining since the peak of the outbreak in 2022. Many countries have successfully controlled their outbreaks. 4. India's health infrastructure: India has a robust public health system and experience in managing infectious disease outbreaks. They have successfully handled larger outbreaks in the past. 5. Vaccination efforts: While not widespread, mpox vaccines are available and can be deployed if needed to control any potential spread. 6. WHO's stance: The WHO declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in July 2022 but ended this status in May 2023, indicating global improvement. 7. Declaration criteria: For an outbreak to be declared over, there typically needs to be a period with no new cases. Given the low number of cases in India, this seems achievable within a year. 8. Potential for new cases: There's always a risk of new cases being imported or undetected transmission chains, which could delay a declaration of the outbreak being over. Considering these factors, it seems likely that India will be able to control and eventually declare the mpox outbreak over by July 2024. The low number of cases, the global declining trend, and the ample time frame all support this conclusion.

Verification requirement: The question requires the use of AI to be confirmed by official records or reputable news sources, which adds a layer of scrutiny. 8. Conservative nature of political institutions: U.S. Congress tends to be slow in adopting new technologies, especially for official purposes. 9. Potential backlash: Constituents might react negatively to a lawmaker using an AI voice clone, viewing it as inauthentic or misleading. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of this occurring. The technology will likely be available and some lawmakers may be tempted to use it for novelty or practical reasons. However, the ethical concerns, potential backlash, and the conservative nature of political institutions will likely deter many from doing so."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Sports content is a key driver for streaming subscriptions, which may motivate them to seek new partnerships. 6. Competition: Other major players like Amazon, Apple, and Disney are also aggressively pursuing sports rights, which could either motivate Paramount to act or potentially price them out of some deals. 7. Economic factors: The overall economic climate and Paramount's financial situation could impact their ability or willingness to invest in expensive sports rights. 8. Broad definition of 'major sports': The question allows for partnerships with a wide range of major sports organizations, increasing the chances of a deal being made. Given these factors, I believe there is a good chance that Paramount will announce a new major sports media partnership within the specified timeframe.

International aid: The level of international support and aid to Yemen could significantly impact the ability to control the outbreak. 6. Climate and environmental factors: Cholera outbreaks can be seasonal and affected by environmental conditions. 7. Previous patterns: The WHO has been cautious about declaring an end to the emergency, given the recurring nature of outbreaks in Yemen. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the WHO will declare the cholera outbreak in Yemen no longer an emergency by August 2024.

The BoC has been raising rates to combat inflation. 2. Inflation targets: The BoC aims to keep inflation at around 2%. If inflation shows signs of consistently decreasing towards this target, it might consider rate cuts. 3. Economic projections: The BoC and other financial institutions' projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation in 2024 will play a crucial role in determining interest rate decisions. 4. Global economic factors: International economic conditions, particularly in the US (Canada's largest trading partner), can influence BoC's decisions. 5.

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut by August 2024. The extended time frame increases the possibility, as it allows for potential economic cooling and inflation reduction. However, the BoC will likely be cautious about cutting rates too soon after a tightening cycle, fearing a resurgence of inflation. If inflation shows a consistent downward trend through 2023 and early 2024, and if economic growth slows significantly, the BoC might consider a rate cut.
