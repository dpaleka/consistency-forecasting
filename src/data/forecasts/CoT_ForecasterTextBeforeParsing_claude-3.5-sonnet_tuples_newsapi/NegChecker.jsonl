This is a relatively short period for completing a major investigation, especially one involving at least five major companies. 2. Complexity of pharmaceutical pricing investigations: These types of investigations are often complex and time-consuming due to the intricacies of pharmaceutical pricing practices and the need to gather and analyze substantial amounts of data from multiple companies. 3. CMA's track record: The Competition and Markets Authority has a history of conducting investigations into pharmaceutical pricing, but major investigations often take several years to complete. For example, their investigation into Pfizer and Flynn Pharma's pricing of phenytoin sodium capsules took about 5 years from 2013 to 2018. 4. Scope of the investigation: The question specifies that the investigation must involve at least five major companies. This broad scope increases the complexity and likely duration of the investigation. 5. Announcement requirements: The completion must be officially announced by the CMA or reported by at least two major news outlets. This adds an extra layer of certainty to the resolution criteria. 6. Current context: As of the creation date (June 30, 2024), there's no mention of an ongoing investigation that's nearing completion. If such an investigation were close to being finished, it would likely be public knowledge. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the CMA would announce the completion of a major pharmaceutical pricing investigation involving at least five companies within just one month. Such investigations typically take years rather than months to complete.

Regulatory priorities: The pharmaceutical industry is a key focus area for the CMA, but the authority also has other sectors to investigate, which may impact the speed of this particular investigation. 6. Public pressure and urgency: Given the importance of pharmaceutical pricing to public health and healthcare costs, there might be pressure to complete the investigation more quickly than usual. 7. Potential delays: Investigations can be delayed due to legal challenges, new evidence, or resource constraints within the CMA. Considering these factors, it seems more likely than not that the CMA will not announce the completion of such a major investigation by July 2024. The complexity and scope of investigating at least five major companies' pricing practices would typically require more than 13 months. While there might be pressure to complete it quickly, the need for thoroughness in such a significant investigation would likely take precedence.

Time frame: The question covers a relatively short period (about two months from the creation date to the resolution date). This limited timeframe reduces the likelihood of a name removal occurring, as such processes often take longer due to administrative procedures and deliberations. 3.

For a name removal to occur, there would need to be a significant public campaign within this short timeframe, which is possible but not guaranteed. 5. University's stance: Columbia has not made any recent public statements indicating plans to remove names from buildings. Without any current controversies or ongoing campaigns, it's less likely that such a decision would be made quickly. 6.

Time frame: The period for Mercedes-Benz to receive the grants is relatively short, just about a month from the question's creation date to the resolution date. This tight timeline makes it less likely for a large grant to be approved and announced. 2. Grant size: $500 million is a substantial amount for a government grant, especially for a single company. Such large grants are not common and typically require extensive review and approval processes. 3. Current EV initiatives: While Mercedes-Benz is actively pursuing electric vehicle production, there's no public information suggesting they are in line for such a large U.S. government grant specifically for EV initiatives. 4. U.S. government funding patterns: The U.S. government has been supportive of EV initiatives, but grants of this magnitude are usually spread across multiple companies or initiatives rather than given to a single foreign automaker. 5. Political climate: Given that 2024 is an election year in the U.S., there might be hesitation in approving large grants to foreign companies, which could face public scrutiny. 6. Mercedes-Benz's status: As a well-established and profitable company, Mercedes-Benz might not be the primary target for such substantial government support compared to emerging EV companies or domestic automakers. 7. Historical precedent: There's no recent precedent of the U.S. government providing such a large grant to a single foreign automaker for EV initiatives. 8. Confirmation requirements: The question stipulates that the confirmation must come from official sources or multiple major news organizations, setting a high bar for verification. Given these factors, it seems more likely that Mercedes-Benz will not receive and have confirmed a grant of over $500 million for EV initiatives by July 2024.

This makes it a prime candidate for federal support in this area. 2. Federal commitment to EV infrastructure: The Biden administration has shown a strong commitment to expanding electric vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing as part of its climate and economic policies. 3. Recent history of federal grants: In recent years, there have been significant federal investments in EV-related projects. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy announced $2.8 billion in grants for EV battery manufacturing and processing facilities across 12 states. 4. California's economic importance: As the largest state economy in the U.S. and a major hub for technology and innovation, California is likely to be a priority for federal investment in emerging technologies like EVs. 5. Time frame: The question allows for a full year (from July 2023 to July 2024) for these grants to be awarded, which is a reasonable timeframe for major federal funding initiatives to be announced and allocated. 6. Specific amount: $300 million, while a substantial sum, is not an unreasonably large amount in the context of federal grants for major infrastructure and technology initiatives, especially for a state as large and economically significant as California. 7. Potential for multiple grants: The total could be reached through a combination of several smaller grants rather than a single large one, increasing the likelihood of reaching the $300 million threshold. 8. California's existing EV industry: The state already has a significant EV manufacturing presence (e.g., Tesla), which could make it an attractive recipient for further investment to boost domestic EV production. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that California would receive over $300 million in federal grants for EV projects within the specified timeframe. The federal government's push for EV adoption, California's leadership in this area, and the state's economic importance all align to make this a probable outcome.

Confirmation requirements: Official university announcements or reports from at least two reputable news sources are needed for confirmation. Given these considerations: - It's more likely that a large donation would be implemented gradually or with certain restrictions, rather than immediately covering full tuition for all economics students. - Universities often have complex financial aid systems, and implementing a blanket full tuition coverage for an entire department is relatively rare. - The short timeframe between the question creation and resolution date suggests that if the donation was not already covering full tuition for all economics students by the time the question was asked, it's unlikely to change within a month. - The requirement for official confirmation or multiple reputable news sources adds another layer of uncertainty, as such information might not be widely publicized within the given timeframe. Considering these factors, it seems more likely that Alibaba's donation will not cover full tuition for all Peking University economics students by July 2024. There's a higher probability that the donation will either be implemented partially, cover only a subset of students, or not be fully implemented by the resolution date."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09020279774316187, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04510139887158093, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4116934847963091, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Timeframe: The question specifies a relatively short timeframe (by August 2024), which limits the opportunity for such a significant policy shift. 5. Bipartisan support for the FDA: Historically, the FDA has enjoyed bipartisan support due to its critical role in public health. 6. Potential for compromise: Even if there is pressure to reduce the FDA's budget, it's more likely that a compromise would be reached for a smaller reduction rather than a cut exceeding 20%. 7. Public opinion: Major cuts to health-related agencies are often unpopular with the public, which could influence senators' decisions. 8. Upcoming elections: With 2024 being an election year, senators might be cautious about supporting drastic cuts to an agency responsible for public health. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the U.S. Senate would pass a bill cutting the FDA's budget by more than 20% by August 2024.

The FDA plays a crucial role in public health and safety, which typically protects it from severe budget reductions. 2. Political landscape: The current political climate and the composition of the Senate are important factors. As of now, the Senate is closely divided, which makes it difficult to pass controversial legislation like major budget cuts to essential agencies. 3. Public opinion: The FDA's role in drug approvals, food safety, and public health is generally viewed positively by the public. A drastic cut to its budget would likely face significant public opposition. 4. Timeframe: The question specifies a period until August 2024, which includes parts of two fiscal years. This relatively short timeframe makes it less likely for such a significant change to occur. 5. Budgetary process: Major budget changes typically go through a complex process involving multiple committees and negotiations between the House and Senate. A 20% cut would be a substantial change that would face scrutiny at various stages. 6. Current events and priorities: The FDA's recent high-profile role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing public health issues makes it less likely to be a target for severe budget cuts. 7. Bipartisan support: The FDA generally enjoys bipartisan support due to its critical role in public health and safety. This makes it less likely to be singled out for major budget reductions. 8. Economic factors: While there may be pressure to reduce government spending, targeting the FDA for such a large cut seems unlikely given its importance to public health and the pharmaceutical industry.

Given these factors, while it's certainly possible for the Georgia Lottery to offer online products by July 2024, it seems unlikely to happen within this timeframe.

Technological infrastructure: Implementing an online lottery system requires significant technological investment and development time. If the Georgia Lottery hasn't already started this process, it might be challenging to complete within 13 months. 5. Public demand and revenue potential: Online lottery products can potentially increase revenue, which might incentivize the state to move in this direction. However, this has to be balanced against potential concerns about problem gambling and accessibility to minors. 6.

The combination of a weakened health system, ongoing conflict, potential underreporting, and favorable conditions for cholera transmission all increase the likelihood of a severe outbreak. However, there are some mitigating factors to consider: 1. International attention and aid might be mobilized to prevent a large-scale outbreak. 2. The official reporting requirement in the question might lead to lower reported numbers due to challenges in confirming and attributing deaths specifically to cholera. 3. There's still a possibility that swift action could contain any outbreaks that do occur. Balancing these factors, I estimate that there is a relatively low probability that Sudan will report 50 or fewer cholera-related deaths by August 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical precedent: South Dakota has a history of using ballot initiatives and referendums, but they are typically for issues like gambling, marijuana, or taxation. Environmental policies have not been a common subject for statewide referendums in South Dakota. 2. Current political climate: South Dakota is generally considered a conservative state, and its government has not shown a strong inclination towards aggressive environmental policies. This reduces the likelihood of a push for significant environmental policy changes through a referendum. 3. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of July 31, 2024, which is about a year from the creation date of this question. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that requires time for planning, approval, and implementation. The relatively short time frame makes it less likely for such a referendum to occur. 4.

If such a referendum were being seriously considered, it would likely be part of public discourse by now. 5. Environmental issues in South Dakota: While the state does face some environmental challenges, such as water quality and soil conservation, these issues have not reached a crisis level that would typically prompt urgent action through a referendum. 6. Legislative process: Environmental policies are usually handled through normal legislative processes rather than through referendums, especially in states without a strong tradition of environmental activism. 7. Resource allocation: Organizing a statewide referendum requires significant resources and political will. Given South Dakota's other priorities and the lack of apparent public demand for such a referendum, it seems unlikely that the state would allocate resources for this purpose. Given these factors, it appears highly unlikely that South Dakota will hold a referendum on environmental policies by July 2024.

Belarus's current relationship with the SCO: Belarus has been an observer state in the SCO since 2015 and applied for full membership in 2022. This long-standing association indicates a strong interest in the organization. 2. Geopolitical alignment: Belarus has close ties with Russia, a founding member of the SCO. Given the current geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West, Belarus is likely to maintain and strengthen its relationships with Russia and its allies. 3. Economic interests: The SCO offers potential economic benefits through increased cooperation with major economies like China and India. Belarus, facing Western sanctions, may see the SCO as an opportunity for economic diversification. 4. Time frame: The question resolution date is relatively soon (about two months from the creation date). This short timeframe makes it less likely for Belarus to dramatically change its foreign policy stance. 5. Historical precedent: Countries rarely withdraw applications to join international organizations unless there's a significant shift in domestic politics or international relations. 6. Potential for joining before August 2024: While it's possible, the SCO membership process typically takes several years, making it unlikely that Belarus would become a full member before the resolution date. 7. Domestic politics: There's no indication of any major political shifts in Belarus that would prompt a withdrawal from the SCO application. 8. International pressure: While Western countries might prefer Belarus not to join the SCO, they have limited leverage over Belarus's foreign policy decisions due to existing sanctions and Belarus's alignment with Russia. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Belarus would withdraw its application to join the SCO by August 2024. The country's geopolitical alignment, economic interests, and the short timeframe all point towards maintaining the application.

Its main patent expired in the US in 2016, but AbbVie has used various strategies to extend its exclusivity. 2. Recent developments: In 2023, AbbVie began allowing biosimilar versions of Humira in the US market due to patent expirations and settlements with other pharmaceutical companies. This suggests a willingness to allow some form of generic competition. 3. Time frame: The question asks about July 2024, which is only about a month from the creation date of this question. This short timeframe makes it less likely for significant policy changes if they haven't already been announced or strongly hinted at. 4. Market pressures: There's increasing pressure on pharmaceutical companies to make drugs more affordable, which could push AbbVie towards allowing generic production. 5.

AbbVie's history and stance on patent protection: AbbVie has a history of aggressively protecting its patents, especially for its blockbuster drug Humira (adalimumab), which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The company has employed various strategies to extend its market exclusivity, including filing multiple patents and engaging in legal battles with potential generic competitors. 2. Current patent status and expiration: While I don't have specific information about the exact patent expiration date for AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis drug, pharmaceutical companies typically try to maintain exclusivity for as long as possible. If the patent is not close to expiration by July 2024, it's unlikely that AbbVie would voluntarily allow generic production. 3. Market considerations: Rheumatoid arthritis drugs are often highly profitable. Allowing generic production would significantly impact AbbVie's revenue from this drug. Companies are generally reluctant to give up such profitable products unless forced to do so by patent expiration or legal challenges. 4.

Current status: Georgia's Medicaid expansion program, known as Georgia Pathways to Coverage, launched on July 1, 2023. As of early 2024, the program had enrolled only about 1,800 people, which is significantly below expectations. 3. Eligibility criteria: Georgia's program is unique in that it requires participants to complete 80 hours of work, job training, education, or volunteering per month to qualify. This requirement is more stringent than traditional Medicaid expansion and may limit enrollment. 4. Potential eligible population: Estimates suggest that around 400,000 to 500,000 Georgians could be eligible for the program. However, the work requirements may reduce this number significantly. 5. Enrollment challenges: The low initial enrollment suggests there are significant barriers to signing up, which could include lack of awareness, difficulty meeting work requirements, or challenges in the application process. 6. Political and administrative factors: The program has faced legal challenges and political opposition, which could impact its implementation and promotion. 7.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Georgia's Medicaid expansion program will reach 300,000 enrollees by July 2024. The current enrollment is extremely low, and even with significant improvements in outreach and enrollment processes, reaching 300,000 from less than 2,000 in about six months appears to be an insurmountable challenge.

Medicaid expansion history: Georgia has been one of the states that initially resisted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. This late adoption might mean there's a significant pool of eligible individuals who have been waiting for coverage. 3. Population and potential enrollees: Georgia has a population of about 10.7 million (as of 2021). Typically, Medicaid expansion covers adults under 65 with income up to 138% of the federal poverty level. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that about 452,000 Georgians would be newly eligible for Medicaid under full expansion. 4. Partial expansion: Georgia's plan is not a full expansion but a partial one with work requirements, which could limit enrollment compared to traditional expansion states. 5. Enrollment challenges: Work requirements and other conditions might slow down enrollment or discourage some eligible individuals from applying. 6. Outreach and awareness: The success of enrollment often depends on effective outreach and education campaigns, which take time to implement and show results. 7. Administrative capacity: The state's ability to process applications and enroll individuals efficiently will impact the enrollment numbers. 8. Political factors: Any changes in state leadership or policy could affect the implementation and promotion of the program. Given these factors, it seems that while the potential pool of eligible individuals is large enough to meet the 300,000 target, there are significant challenges that could slow down enrollment. The partial nature of the expansion and the work requirements are particularly likely to limit enrollment compared to traditional expansion states. However, 13 months is a substantial amount of time for enrollment efforts, and there's likely to be a significant initial surge of enrollments as the program launches. Additionally, the pressure to show success and the potential federal incentives for expansion might motivate the state to push hard for enrollment.

CDC's approach: The CDC tends to be cautious in declaring outbreaks over, often waiting for a sustained period of low case numbers before making such announcements. 3. Time frame: The question asks about August 2024, which is more than a year away from the current date. This provides a significant amount of time for the situation to evolve. 4. Historical precedents: Previous disease outbreaks have shown that even after case numbers decline significantly, health authorities often maintain vigilance for an extended period. 5. Potential for resurgence: While cases have declined, there's always a possibility of a resurgence, especially if vaccination efforts slow down or new variants emerge. 6. CDC's criteria: The CDC typically looks for a sustained period of low or no new cases before declaring an outbreak over. The exact criteria may vary depending on the specific disease. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely that the CDC will have declared the mpox outbreak over by August 2024. Here's why: - The significant decline in cases as of mid-2023 suggests that if this trend continues, there will be ample time for the CDC to confidently declare the outbreak over by August 2024. - The long time frame (over a year) provides sufficient time for monitoring and ensuring that the decline in cases is sustained. - The end of the WHO's global health emergency status may influence the CDC's decision-making process. However, there are reasons to be cautious: - The CDC might maintain a watchful stance even with low case numbers, especially if there are occasional small clusters of cases. - There's always a possibility of unexpected developments, such as new variants or changes in the virus's behavior. Considering all these factors, I estimate that there's a relatively low probability that the CDC will not have declared the outbreak over by August 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The ANC's majority, the president's influence within his party, the short timeframe, and the upcoming elections all work against this scenario. However, the possibility can't be completely ruled out. Economic pressures or internal party disagreements could potentially lead to a situation where a reform bill is pushed through against the president's wishes.

Political landscape: South Africa's current political situation is complex. President Ramaphosa, while generally pro-business, has faced challenges in implementing economic reforms due to opposition within his own party (ANC) and from other parties. 2. Economic reform needs: South Africa's economy has been struggling, with high unemployment and slow growth. This creates pressure for economic reforms, but also resistance to changes that might be seen as too drastic or harmful to certain groups. 3. Legislative process: The National Council of Provinces is the upper house of South Africa's parliament. It represents provincial interests and can delay or block legislation. However, it generally follows the lead of the National Assembly, where the ANC holds a majority. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 14 months (from now until August 2024). This is a significant amount of time in which economic reforms could be proposed and passed. 5. Opposition criteria: For the question to resolve as YES, any major economic reform bill passed must be explicitly opposed by Ramaphosa or his administration. This is a strong condition, as Ramaphosa is likely to support at least some economic reforms. 6. Definition of \"major\": The requirement for the bill to be described as \"major\" or \"significant\" by international news sources sets a high bar. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that the question will resolve as YES. Here's why: - The ANC is known for internal disagreements on economic policy, which could lead to delays in proposing major reforms. - Ramaphosa has shown caution in pushing for dramatic economic changes, preferring incremental approaches. - The specific criteria for opposition and significance make it less likely for a bill to meet all the conditions for a NO resolution. - The time frame, while significant, may not be enough to overcome political obstacles and push through major reforms that Ramaphosa opposes. However, there's still a substantial chance of a NO resolution, given the pressing need for economic reforms and the possibility of compromise within the ANC."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.05590980080583696, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.02795490040291848, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.33520076157699535, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

U.S. government's stance on EV initiatives: The current administration has shown strong support for electric vehicles and clean energy initiatives, which could potentially benefit companies like Fisker. 3. Competition for grants: Many automotive companies, including larger and more established ones, are likely competing for similar grants, which could make it challenging for Fisker to secure such a large amount. 4.

This is a relatively short time frame for such a significant amount of funding. 5. Previous grant history: As of my knowledge cutoff, I'm not aware of Fisker receiving any substantial government grants. This lack of precedent makes it harder to predict future grant approvals. 6.

They've had financial difficulties and have been struggling to ramp up production. 2. Government support for EV initiatives: The U.S. government has shown interest in supporting electric vehicle initiatives as part of its climate change and clean energy policies. However, large grants are typically given to more established companies or those with proven track records. 3. Competition: There are many other electric vehicle manufacturers, including well-established ones like Tesla, GM, and Ford, who are also likely seeking government support. This increases competition for available funds. 4. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is about a year away. This is a relatively short time for a company to secure such a large grant, especially if they're not already in advanced talks with the government. 5. Amount of the grant: $500 million is a substantial amount for a government grant, particularly for a single company in the EV sector. Grants of this size are not common and would likely require significant justification and negotiation. 6. Fisker's current relationship with the government: There's no widely publicized information about Fisker being in talks for such a large grant, which suggests they may not be far along in the process if they are pursuing it. 7. Historical precedent: While the government has provided support to the EV industry, grants of over $500 million to a single company are rare. Most support comes in the form of tax credits or smaller grants. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Fisker will fail to receive over $500 million in grants by July 2024. The company's current challenges, the competitive landscape, the large amount of the grant, and the relatively short timeframe all work against the likelihood of securing such a substantial grant.

The current rates are already above this level, and while there's a possibility of rates decreasing, it would require a significant economic shift to bring them below 5.5% and keep them there consistently through August 2024.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Florida will implement a free community college plan by July 2024. The lack of current discussion or movement towards such a policy, combined with the political landscape and the short timeframe, makes it improbable that a comprehensive, statewide free community college plan will be implemented within the next year.

Time frame: The resolution date is August 31, 2024, which is about two months from the question's creation date. This is a relatively short period for planning and executing such a large financial operation. 5. Size of the issuance: $1 billion is a significant amount, especially for a single issuance by an Indian bank. It would represent a major financial move for Bank of India. 6. Bank of India's financial position: As of my last update, Bank of India was not among the largest banks in India, which makes such a large issuance less likely. 7. Lack of prior announcements: Given the size of the potential issuance, if Bank of India was planning such a move, it would likely have been telegraphed to the market well in advance. The lack of such announcements as of the question's creation date makes it less likely to occur within the given timeframe. 8. Economic conditions in India: While India's economy has been growing, there haven't been any recent indications of a sudden surge in demand for such large-scale loan sales. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Bank of India will not issue pass-through certificates worth at least $1 billion by August 2024. The short timeframe, the large amount involved, and the lack of historical precedent or current indications all point towards this outcome being unlikely. However, it's important to note that unexpected developments in the financial sector or changes in regulatory policy could potentially lead to such an issuance. Therefore, while unlikely, it's not impossible."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.012003969168639106, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.006001984584319553, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1550434182365107, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Time frame: The question allows for a relatively long period (until August 2024) for additional layoffs to be announced, increasing the likelihood of such an event occurring. 6. Past behavior: Twitter has already shown a willingness to implement significant layoffs, which suggests they may be open to further cuts if deemed necessary. 7. Ongoing restructuring: As Twitter continues to adapt to new ownership and strategic direction, further organizational changes may be required. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high likelihood of Twitter announcing additional layoffs beyond the initial 20% by August 2024.

Political climate: There has been increasing pressure and public debate about the need for an ethics code for Supreme Court justices, especially in light of recent controversies involving some justices. 4. Legislative process: Establishing an enforceable ethics code would likely require an act of Congress, which can be a lengthy and complex process, especially given the current political polarization. 5. Constitutional considerations: There may be constitutional challenges to imposing an ethics code on the Supreme Court, as it could be seen as infringing on the separation of powers. 6. Historical precedent: Despite periodic calls for such a code, the Supreme Court has resisted formal ethics rules for centuries, citing the need for independence. 7. Recent developments: In April 2023, Chief Justice John Roberts announced that the Court is working on a code of conduct, but it's unclear if this will meet the criteria of being 'enforceable' and 'legally binding' as specified in the question. Given these factors, I believe it is more likely than not that no enforceable ethics code for U.S. Supreme Court justices will be established by July 2024. The main reasons for this assessment are: - The short time frame (about a year) is likely insufficient for such a significant change, given the typical pace of legislative action and potential constitutional challenges. - The historical resistance of the Supreme Court to external regulation. - The potential for political gridlock in Congress, which could prevent the passage of necessary legislation. - The uncertainty about whether any internally developed code (like the one mentioned by Chief Justice Roberts) would meet the 'enforceable' and 'legally binding' criteria specified in the question.

This lack of means-testing is unusual for large-scale financial aid programs. 6. Coca-Cola's focus: While Coca-Cola does engage in corporate social responsibility initiatives, their educational efforts typically focus on sustainability, water stewardship, and women's empowerment rather than broad tuition coverage. 7. Princeton's existing financial aid: Princeton already has a generous financial aid program. It's unclear why Coca-Cola would step in to cover tuition that the university might already be covering for many students. 8. Lack of current indications: As of the question's creation date, there are no public rumors or indications that such an arrangement is being considered. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Coca-Cola would fund full tuition for all Princeton economics students by July 2024. The specificity of the arrangement, the short timeframe, and the lack of precedent or current indications all point towards this not happening."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.004701328069160127, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0023506640345800633, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08250633145795322, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given these factors, a rate cut by August 2024 is possible but not highly likely. The central bank would need to see compelling reasons to reduce rates, such as a significant economic slowdown or persistently low inflation. While global economic conditions might push for looser monetary policy, Indonesia's central bank has historically been cautious about following global trends too closely.

By this time, the Democratic National Convention would likely have already taken place, and the party's nominees would be officially confirmed. 4. Location specificity: The question specifically mentions Minneapolis as the location for the announcement. There's no particular significance of Minneapolis for Harris that would make it a likely choice for such an announcement. 5. Unusual scenario: The scenario described in the question (Harris announcing her own running mate) would only occur if she were the presidential nominee, which is highly unlikely given the current political situation. Given these factors, it is extremely unlikely that Kamala Harris would be in a position to announce her own running mate, let alone do so at a specific rally in Minneapolis by August 2024. The most probable scenario is that she will continue as Biden's running mate, or if there's any change, it would be announced well before August and through official channels rather than at a specific rally.

Political climate: Missouri is a conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature and governor. This suggests a political environment that is generally supportive of strict abortion restrictions. 3. Recent trends in abortion legislation: Following the overturning of Roe v.

This is a relatively short period for a case to move through the court system, especially if it involves appeals. 5. Precedent in other states: Some states have seen their abortion bans upheld by state courts, while others have had them struck down. The outcome often depends on the specific language of the state constitution and the composition of the state supreme court. 6.

Historical context: The BOJ has maintained ultra-low interest rates for an extended period to combat deflation and stimulate economic growth. They have been hesitant to raise rates quickly. 3.

Yield curve control: The BOJ has been using yield curve control to cap 10-year government bond yields. Any changes to this policy could impact their interest rate decisions. 6.

Historical precedent: New York State does not have a strong tradition of holding statewide referendums on specific policy issues. The state constitution limits the use of referendums, and they are relatively rare. 2. Legislative process: Climate change policy in New York is typically addressed through legislative action rather than direct democracy. The state has been proactive in passing climate-related legislation, such as the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in 2019, without resorting to referendums. 3. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of August 31, 2024, which is relatively soon. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex and time-consuming process that would likely require significant lead time. 4. Current political landscape: There are no widely reported plans or discussions about holding a climate change policy referendum in New York. Such a significant political event would likely be in the news if it were being seriously considered. 5. Existing climate initiatives: New York already has ambitious climate goals and policies in place, which may reduce the perceived need for a referendum on the issue. 6. Complexity of the issue: Climate change policy is a complex and multifaceted topic that may not be well-suited to a simple yes/no referendum format. 7. COVID-19 impact: The ongoing pandemic has shifted priorities and resources, potentially making it less likely for the state to organize a non-essential referendum. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that New York would hold a referendum specifically on climate change policy by August 2024.

Current minimum wage: As of 2023, Ohio's minimum wage is $10.10 per hour for non-tipped employees at larger businesses (with annual gross receipts of $372,000 or more). The question states that fast food workers currently have a minimum wage of $11 per hour, which is already above the state's general minimum wage. 2. Historical trends: Ohio has been gradually increasing its minimum wage over the years. The state has a constitutional amendment that adjusts the minimum wage annually based on inflation. 3. Political climate: Ohio has a Republican-controlled state legislature and a Republican governor, which might typically be less inclined to support significant minimum wage increases. However, the existing $11 per hour for fast food workers suggests some level of support for higher wages in this sector. 4. Economic factors: Inflation and cost of living increases might put pressure on maintaining or even increasing the minimum wage. 5. Industry-specific considerations: The fact that fast food workers already have a higher minimum wage than the general state minimum suggests that there are industry-specific factors at play, possibly related to labor shortages or unionization efforts in the fast food sector. 6. Time frame: The question only asks about maintaining the current wage through July 2024, which is a relatively short period (about one year from the question's creation date). 7. Lack of information about pending legislation: There's no mention of any current proposals to change the fast food worker minimum wage in Ohio. Given these factors, it seems likely that Ohio will maintain its $11 per hour minimum wage for fast food workers through July 2024. The main reasons for this assessment are: - The wage is already in place, and there's no indication of any immediate plans to reduce it. - The time frame is relatively short, making significant changes less likely. - Even if there were attempts to reduce this wage, such changes often face significant opposition and take time to implement. - The general trend in the US has been towards increasing rather than decreasing minimum wages. However, there is always some uncertainty due to potential unforeseen economic or political factors that could lead to wage reductions. Therefore, while I believe it's highly likely the wage will be maintained, I can't be 100% certain."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "b1336fbc-9cb3-4869-9b2a-31313f5ab051", "title": "Will Ohio reduce its $11 per hour minimum wage for fast food workers before July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, at any point before July 31, 2024, the minimum wage for fast food workers in Ohio is reduced below $11 per hour.

Political climate: Ohio is a swing state with a Republican governor and a Republican-controlled legislature. While Republicans are generally less inclined to raise minimum wages, actively reducing an existing minimum wage is rare and politically risky. 3. Economic factors: If Ohio were facing a severe economic downturn, there might be pressure to reduce labor costs. However, there's no indication of such a crisis that would necessitate this drastic measure. 4. Legal considerations: Reducing an established minimum wage could face legal challenges and would likely require new legislation, which takes time to pass and implement. 5.

Timeframe: The question asks about a reduction before July 2024, which is a relatively short period for such a significant policy change to be proposed, passed, and implemented. 7.

Economic trends: The fast food industry is generally resilient during economic downturns, as people often turn to cheaper dining options. However, the industry has faced challenges in recent years due to labor shortages and wage pressures. 2. Labor market conditions: The US labor market has been tight, with low unemployment rates. This could lead to wage increases in the fast food sector to attract workers, potentially causing some businesses to reduce staff to manage costs. 3. Automation: The fast food industry is increasingly adopting automation technologies, which could lead to a reduction in human employment over time. However, this trend might not have a significant impact by July 2024, as implementation is often gradual. 4. Population growth: North Carolina has been experiencing population growth, which could increase demand for fast food services and potentially maintain or increase employment levels. 5. Minimum wage: North Carolina follows the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which hasn't changed since 2009. If there's no significant increase in minimum wage by July 2024, it's less likely to cause employment decreases due to higher labor costs. 6. COVID-19 recovery: The fast food industry has shown resilience during the pandemic, with many establishments adapting to drive-thru and delivery services. As the economy continues to recover, fast food employment might stabilize or grow. 7. Seasonal factors: The question specifies using seasonally adjusted data if available, which helps mitigate the impact of seasonal fluctuations on employment numbers. 8.

The original 'Dredd' (2012) was a box office disappointment, grossing only about $41 million worldwide against a budget of $30-45 million. 2. Production timeline: Even if 'Dredd 2' were to be announced immediately, it would be extremely challenging to complete production, post-production, and release the film in theaters by August 2024.

Given these factors, it is extremely unlikely that 'Dredd 2' will be the highest-grossing R-rated movie by August 2024.

Historical performance: The FTSE MIB has shown volatility in recent years, but it has demonstrated the ability to reach and exceed 28,000 points in the past. It hit an all-time high of over 50,000 points in 2000 and has occasionally surpassed 28,000 points in recent years. 3.

Given the short timeframe, it's unlikely that a new law could be fully enacted within this period unless it was already well into the legislative process. 4. Precedent: As of now, there doesn't seem to be any widely reported movement or strong push for such legislation in Tennessee. If there were ongoing efforts, it would likely be visible in local news or legislative agendas. 5. State priorities: Given the current economic and social challenges faced by many states, including Tennessee, it's possible that cosmetics labeling may not be a top priority for lawmakers in this short timeframe. 6. Federal vs. State regulation: Cosmetics labeling is often regulated at the federal level by the FDA. States may be hesitant to enact laws that could potentially conflict with federal regulations. 7. Industry self-regulation: Many cosmetics companies already voluntarily label their products as 'cruelty-free' to meet consumer demands, which might reduce the perceived need for state-level regulation. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Tennessee would enact new labeling requirements for 'cruelty-free' cosmetics in such a short timeframe. While it's not impossible, the combination of the brief period, the lack of current visible momentum for such legislation, and the complexity of enacting new laws makes it improbable."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For example, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was released in March 2022 after years of detention. 5. Political climate: The relationship between Iran and Western countries, including the UK, remains tense due to various factors including nuclear negotiations and human rights concerns. 6. Diplomatic efforts: The UK government typically works continuously to secure the release of its citizens held abroad, including in Iran. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that no British citizen will be released from Iranian custody by July 2024. Here's why: - The time frame of one year is relatively long in diplomatic terms, providing ample opportunity for negotiations. - There's ongoing pressure on both governments to resolve these cases, both from families of the detained and from international organizations. - Historical precedent shows that releases do occur, even if they take time. - The UK government has a strong incentive to secure releases, especially as these cases often receive significant media attention. However, it's important to note that releases are not guaranteed, and the process can be unpredictable. Iran may use detainees as bargaining chips in broader geopolitical negotiations, which could potentially delay releases. Considering all these factors, I estimate that there's a good chance at least one British citizen will be released from Iranian custody by July 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.176656285535155, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0883281427675775, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6201736729460423, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

High bar for resolution: The question requires credible reports from multiple reputable sources, which sets a high standard for any potential misinformation to be officially recognized. However, we must also consider potential risks: 1. Increased scrutiny: As AI becomes more prevalent, there may be increased attention on AI assistants like Siri during election periods. 2. Evolving misinformation tactics: Bad actors might find new ways to manipulate AI systems to spread misinformation. 3. Potential for errors: Despite precautions, there's always a small chance of system errors or unintended behaviors. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that Siri will not be reported for spreading election misinformation by August 2024. The combination of Apple's reputation, Siri's design, and the high bar for resolution all point towards a low probability of such reports emerging."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.012333651126851919, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0061668255634259594, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15570941865504534, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Implementing significant changes to Medicaid plans typically requires extensive planning, legislative processes, and federal approval, which often takes much longer than a month. 3. Political climate: Medicaid policies can be politically contentious. With 2024 being a presidential election year in the U.S., states might be hesitant to implement controversial changes to their Medicaid programs. 4. Complexity of implementation: Nutritional support requirements can be complex to implement and monitor, which might deter states from adopting such plans quickly. 5. Federal approval: Any significant changes to state Medicaid plans typically require approval from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which can be a lengthy process. 6. Lack of precedent: Apart from Georgia, there doesn't seem to be a trend of states adopting similar requirements, which suggests that other states might not be actively considering such plans. 7.

Inflation trends: South Korea's inflation rate has been moderating, but it's still above the central bank's 2% target. If inflation continues to decline, it could pave the way for rate cuts. 3. Global economic outlook: The global economy is facing uncertainties due to various factors, including geopolitical tensions and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Current status: As of now (2023), Imelda Marcos is not in prison. She was convicted of corruption in 2018 but has remained free on bail while appealing the verdict. 2. Age and health: Imelda Marcos was born in 1929, making her 94 years old in 2023 and 95 in July 2024. Her advanced age and potential health issues could be factors in considering alternative forms of confinement. 3. Political influence: The Marcos family still holds significant political power in the Philippines. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Imelda's son, is the current President of the Philippines (elected in 2022). 4. Legal process: The Philippine legal system can be slow, and appeals can take years. It's possible that her appeals process might still be ongoing in July 2024. 5. Public opinion and international pressure: There might be both domestic and international pressure to see Marcos serve her sentence, given the high-profile nature of her case. 6. Precedents: In the Philippines, there have been cases where high-profile convicts have been granted house arrest or hospital detention due to age or health concerns. Given these factors, I believe there's a significant chance that Imelda Marcos could be granted some form of alternative confinement or temporary release in July 2024, if she is indeed required to serve her sentence by that time. The primary reasons for this assessment are: 1. Her advanced age and potential health issues, which could be used as grounds for house arrest or hospital detention. 2. The political influence of the Marcos family, with her son as the sitting president. 3. The slow pace of the Philippine legal system, which might mean her appeals are still ongoing. However, there are also factors that could lead to a standard prison sentence: 1. Public and international pressure for accountability. 2. The severity of her corruption charges. Balancing these considerations, I believe there's a higher than average chance of Marcos being granted house arrest or some form of release, but it's far from certain."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.17089956220541458, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.08544978110270729, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5710402407201607, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Recent history: Meta (formerly Facebook) has a history of significant layoffs. In 2022 and 2023, the company conducted major layoffs, cutting over 20,000 jobs. This demonstrates that the company is not averse to large-scale workforce reductions when deemed necessary. 2. AI focus: Meta has been increasingly emphasizing its focus on AI, which often leads to restructuring and reallocation of resources. This AI-focused reorganization plan could potentially lead to the elimination of roles that are less aligned with this new direction. 3. Economic factors: The tech industry has been facing economic pressures, with many companies conducting layoffs to reduce costs. While the economy has shown some signs of improvement, companies are still cautious about their workforce size. 4.

This tight timeline might make it less likely for such a significant layoff to be planned, announced, and executed. 5. Specific number: The threshold of 1,800 employees is quite specific. While it's not an unreasonably large number given Meta's size, it's also not a small figure that could be easily reached through normal attrition or small-scale restructuring. 6. Public announcements: Meta would need to publicly confirm these layoffs, which adds another layer of consideration. Companies sometimes prefer to conduct layoffs more quietly or in phases to manage public perception. 7. Previous reorganization efforts: If Meta has already conducted significant layoffs or reorganizations related to its AI focus prior to this question being asked, it might reduce the likelihood of another large layoff in such a short timeframe. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability of this occurring.

AI-focused reorganization: The question specifically mentions an AI-focused reorganization plan. Given the current tech industry trend towards AI, it's possible that Meta is restructuring to focus more on AI-related roles. This could potentially lead to layoffs in other areas of the company. Time frame: The question asks about layoffs by July 2024, which is about a year from the question's creation date. This is a relatively short time frame for a major reorganization, which might limit the scale of potential layoffs. Economic conditions: The tech industry has been facing challenges, including economic uncertainties and market pressures. This could influence Meta's decision-making regarding workforce adjustments. Company performance: Meta's financial performance and strategic goals will play a crucial role in determining the need for layoffs. Without specific information about Meta's current situation, it's difficult to predict their exact plans. Threshold: The question asks about fewer than 1,800 employees. This is a relatively small number compared to Meta's total workforce (which was around 86,000 after the 2022 layoffs), but still significant for a targeted reorganization. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely that Meta will lay off fewer than 1,800 employees by July 2024. The reasons for this assessment are: a) The recent large-scale layoffs in 2022 and 2023 may have already streamlined the company significantly, reducing the need for another major cut. b) An AI-focused reorganization might involve more retraining and reallocation of existing staff rather than large-scale layoffs. c) The relatively short time frame (about a year) might limit the scale of the reorganization. d) 1,800 employees, while significant, is a small percentage of Meta's total workforce, making it more likely that any layoffs would fall below this threshold.

Time frame: The question covers a relatively short period (about a month), which reduces the likelihood of such an announcement occurring. 4. Twitter's current AI focus: Twitter has been investing in AI for various purposes, including content moderation and personalization. They may need to continue expanding this area to remain competitive. 5. Economic factors: The tech industry has faced some economic challenges recently, which could lead to more conservative hiring practices. 6. Public announcements: Twitter may choose to make internal changes without public announcements, especially given the short timeframe. 7. Musk's unpredictability: Elon Musk's leadership style is known for being unpredictable, which adds uncertainty to any predictions about Twitter's future plans. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely that Twitter will not announce plans to increase its AI-related workforce by July 2024. The short timeframe, recent restructuring, and potential for internal changes without public announcements all contribute to this assessment. However, the importance of AI in the tech industry and Twitter's need to remain competitive introduce some uncertainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.176656285535155, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0883281427675775, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6201736729460421, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Legal challenges: The Supreme Court struck down President Biden's initial student loan forgiveness plan in June 2023. This setback means the administration needs to develop a new approach that can withstand legal scrutiny. 3. Political landscape: With 2024 being a presidential election year, there may be increased pressure on the Biden administration to deliver on campaign promises, including student loan forgiveness. 4. Alternative approaches: The administration has been exploring other avenues for loan forgiveness, such as using the Higher Education Act or targeting specific groups of borrowers. 5. Bureaucratic processes: Implementing a large-scale loan forgiveness program requires significant administrative work, which can be time-consuming. 6. Congressional support: Depending on the approach taken, the administration may need support from Congress, which could be challenging given potential political opposition. 7. Economic considerations: The state of the economy and concerns about inflation may influence the urgency and scale of any loan forgiveness plan. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high chance that the Education Department will fail to implement a plan by July 2024.

Political climate: Nevada has a Democratic governor and a Democratic-controlled legislature, which typically favors maintaining or increasing minimum wages rather than reducing them. 4. Economic factors: While economic downturns can sometimes lead to calls for wage reductions, the U.S. economy has been relatively stable, and there's no indication of a severe recession that might prompt such drastic measures. 5.

Streaming competition: With the rise of streaming services, there's increased competition for sports rights. Paramount+, Paramount's streaming service, may be looking to bolster its offerings to compete with other platforms. 6. Financial considerations: While Paramount has the resources to pursue major sports rights, they also need to balance this with financial prudence. Not every opportunity will make financial sense. 7. Exclusivity clause: The question specifies \"new\" partnerships, which means renewing existing deals wouldn't count. This slightly reduces the probability. Given these factors, I believe there's a good chance Paramount will announce a new major sports media partnership within the specified timeframe. The company has both the motivation and the means to pursue such deals, and the market dynamics favor active pursuit of sports rights. However, the requirement for it to be a new partnership and the potential for deals to fall through or be delayed slightly tempers the probability."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "49e3b796-8b32-42f9-91e6-a0d36d6d64a1", "title": "Will Paramount not announce a new major sports media partnership by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, Paramount does not publicly announce a new partnership related to major sports media rights or broadcasting.

Global economic trends: Global economic conditions, including those in the US (Canada's largest trading partner), influence the BoC's decisions. If global economic conditions remain uncertain or inflationary pressures persist, the BoC may be less likely to cut rates. 4. Time frame: The question asks about a period ending in August 2024, which is more than a year away. This provides a significant amount of time for economic conditions to change. 5.

Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that the Bank of Canada will refrain from announcing a rate cut by August 2024. The BoC's primary focus on controlling inflation, the recent history of rate hikes, and the time it takes for monetary policy to impact the economy all suggest that they will be cautious about cutting rates too soon.

Historical context: South Dakota doesn't have a recent history of frequent statewide referendums on education reform. This suggests that such a referendum is not a regular occurrence. 2. Time frame: The question is asking about a relatively short period (about one month from the creation date to the resolution date). Organizing a statewide referendum typically requires significant planning and preparation time, which makes it less likely to occur within this brief window. 3. Legislative process: Education reform often goes through the state legislature rather than direct referendum. It's more common for states to pass education reforms through their legislative bodies rather than putting them to a public vote. 4. Current political climate: As of my knowledge cutoff, there were no major ongoing debates or pushes for education reform in South Dakota that would necessitate a referendum. Without a pressing issue, it's less likely for a referendum to be organized. 5.

Time elapsed: The COVID-19 pandemic's most severe restrictions were in 2020-2021. By August 2024, over three years will have passed since the height of the pandemic.

This significant time lapse reduces the likelihood of a lawsuit being filed, as the immediacy and emotional impact of the situation will have diminished. 2. Legal statute of limitations: Most civil lawsuits have a statute of limitations, typically ranging from 1-6 years depending on the type of case and jurisdiction. By 2024, it's possible that the statute of limitations for such a lawsuit may have expired, further decreasing the likelihood of legal action. 3. Current relationship between the Speedway and state officials: There's no indication of ongoing tension or public disputes between the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Indiana health officials, which suggests a lower probability of legal action. 4.

Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high likelihood of France and Saudi Arabia implementing a new form of cooperation by July 2024. The existing strong relationship, mutual interests, and recent high-level engagements suggest that both countries are actively seeking to expand their partnership.

This suggests that there is an existing concern about this issue, which increases the likelihood of a recall. Number of vehicles: The threshold of 720,000 vehicles is quite high for a single recall. This large number might indicate a widespread problem affecting multiple models or years of production. Timeframe: The period from now (June 2024) to August 2024 is relatively short for initiating such a large recall. However, if the issue is serious enough, it could be expedited. Regulatory pressure: Given the environmental concerns around excessive pollutants, there may be regulatory pressure to address this issue quickly.

Existing abortion laws in Ohio: Ohio currently has restrictive abortion laws, which might motivate abortion rights advocates to push for a referendum. 5. Precedent in Ohio: Ohio has a history of ballot initiatives, including on controversial topics. Given these factors, here's my analysis: - The short timeline (about a year) makes it less likely for a referendum to be organized, announced, and held by July 2024. Organizing such a referendum typically requires significant time for planning, signature gathering, and legal processes. - However, the contentious nature of abortion rights and the recent trend of state-level actions on this issue could accelerate the process. - Ohio's current restrictive abortion laws might motivate abortion rights advocates to push for a referendum, but it could also face significant opposition from conservative groups. - The requirement for the referendum to be formally announced by the Ohio state government and verified by major news organizations adds an additional hurdle. - The specific focus on 'enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution' makes this a more challenging proposition in a conservative-leaning state like Ohio. Considering all these factors, I believe it is more likely than not that Ohio will not hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024.

Government policies: Any planned or potential changes in labor laws, unemployment benefits, or economic stimulus measures could affect jobless claims. 6. Global economic factors: International trade relations, global economic conditions, and potential crises could impact France's job market. Without access to specific recent data on France's weekly jobless claims or detailed economic projections, it's challenging to make a highly confident prediction. However, considering that: a) France has a relatively stable economy in the EU b) The threshold of 200,000 weekly claims for three consecutive weeks is quite high and would likely only occur during a significant economic downturn c) The timeframe is relatively short (about 14 months), reducing the chance of a major economic crisis developing and causing sustained high unemployment.

In the post-pandemic recovery period, the city might be hesitant to impose further restrictions that could impact tourism. 5.

While some residents and the hotel industry push for stricter regulations, platforms like Airbnb and property owners who benefit from short-term rentals lobby against further restrictions.

Political climate: The current political environment in the United States is highly polarized, making it difficult to achieve consensus on many issues, let alone one that would impose restrictions on lawmakers themselves. 4. Resistance to change: Members of Congress may be reluctant to impose strict ethical standards on themselves, as it could limit their activities or expose them to greater scrutiny. 5. Public pressure: There has been ongoing public and media pressure for greater accountability in Congress, which could potentially drive change. However, this pressure has existed for years without resulting in a comprehensive ethics code. 6. Complexity of implementation: Creating an enforceable ethics code that applies to all members of Congress would be a complex undertaking, requiring agreement on standards, enforcement mechanisms, and potential penalties. 7. Legislative priorities: With numerous pressing national issues, an ethics code for Congress members may not be a top priority for lawmakers in the coming year. 8. Recent attempts: There have been some recent efforts to introduce ethics reforms, such as the Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act, but these have not resulted in comprehensive, enforceable codes. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that a comprehensive, enforceable ethics code for Congress members will be established within the next year. While there is ongoing discussion and some pressure for such reforms, the combination of political resistance, complexity of the task, and short time frame make it improbable that such a significant change will occur by July 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This has been a long-standing policy to maintain domestic food security and control prices. Historical context: Thailand has been known to use export taxes as a tool for economic management, especially for key agricultural products like rice. Economic considerations: Export taxes can provide revenue for the government and help control domestic prices, but they can also make Thai agricultural products less competitive in the global market. Global trade trends: There's a general trend towards reducing trade barriers, including export taxes, but many countries still maintain some protectionist measures for strategic sectors like agriculture.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Thailand would completely eliminate export taxes on all agricultural products by July 2024: Such a sweeping change would be a significant shift in policy that would likely require extensive debate and planning.

The country has faced economic and political instability, which has impacted its healthcare system. 2. Historical context: Venezuela had previously made significant progress in controlling malaria, but in recent years, there has been a resurgence due to various factors including economic crisis, lack of resources, and migration. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a declaration by August 2024, which gives approximately 14 months from the creation date of the question (June 30, 2024) for the situation to improve. 4. International assistance: The WHO and other international organizations have been providing support to Venezuela to combat malaria. This external help could potentially accelerate efforts to control the outbreak. 5. Political considerations: The Venezuelan government might be motivated to declare an end to the outbreak for political reasons, even if the situation hasn't fully improved. 6. Reporting requirements: The question specifies that the declaration must be reported by at least two major international news outlets or the WHO, which adds an additional layer of verification. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that Venezuela will officially declare an end to its current malaria outbreak by August 2024. The reasons for this assessment are: a) The ongoing economic and political instability in Venezuela makes it challenging to implement effective health interventions. b) Malaria outbreaks typically take several years to fully control, especially in resource-limited settings. c) The requirement for international reporting adds a level of scrutiny that might deter premature declarations. d) While external assistance is helpful, the scale of the problem and the country's internal challenges make rapid resolution unlikely.

This number significantly exceeds the 150,000 threshold mentioned in the question. 3. Enrollment trends: Medicaid expansion programs typically see rapid initial enrollment followed by a slower but steady increase. Given that Missouri's program has been active for over two years, it's likely that the majority of eligible individuals have already enrolled. 4.

Government-developed AI systems: While many governments are investing in AI technology, it's less common for governments to develop AI systems specifically for public-facing communication about elections. Most government AI projects tend to focus on areas like defense, healthcare, or internal operations. 3. Potential for errors: If a government does deploy an AI system related to elections, there's always a possibility of errors or unintended outputs, especially given the complex and often nuanced nature of election information. 4. Scrutiny and reporting: Government-developed AI systems, particularly those related to elections, would likely face intense scrutiny from the media, opposition parties, and watchdog organizations. This increases the likelihood that any issues would be quickly identified and reported. 5.

Given these factors, it seems highly likely that the volleyball events will be held at the Accor Arena as planned. The venue has been officially announced, it's suitable for the event, and there's little time left for major changes.

This reduces the likelihood of a significant strike occurring within the next month. 3.

The city has been expanding its public transit system, including the Dubai Metro and bus networks. 2. World Expo's emphasis on sustainability: World Expos often showcase innovative and sustainable solutions. A public transit-only policy would align with this theme and demonstrate Dubai's commitment to sustainable urban development. 3. Traffic management: Dubai faces significant traffic congestion issues.

However, the city is still largely car-dependent, with many residents and visitors relying on private vehicles. 2. Environmental considerations: With growing global awareness of climate change, there might be pressure on Dubai to showcase sustainability efforts during the Expo. A public transit-only policy could be seen as a positive step in this direction. 3.

Typically, monthly job growth in Argentina has been much lower than 200,000. 2. Economic conditions: Argentina has been struggling with economic instability, which can hinder significant job growth. The country has been working with the IMF to stabilize its economy, but progress has been slow. 3.

Adding 200,000 jobs in a single month would represent a significant percentage of the workforce, which is unlikely in normal circumstances. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Argentina would add 200,000 jobs in any single month during the specified period.

In recent years, there have been numerous demonstrations against underfunding and privatization of the NHS. 2. Current state of UK healthcare: The NHS is already under significant strain due to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, staffing shortages, and long waiting times for treatments.

Any decision to cut healthcare funding would likely be met with strong opposition from both the public and opposition parties. 4. Economic factors: The UK, like many countries, is facing economic challenges. If the government decides to cut healthcare funding as part of broader austerity measures, it could spark widespread discontent. 5. Timing: The question specifies a timeframe until July 2024, which is over a year away. This provides ample time for funding cuts to be announced, implemented, and for public reaction to build. 6.

This makes it more likely for a protest to meet the specified criteria. 8. Public sentiment: Healthcare is a deeply personal and emotive issue for many people. Cuts to funding could directly impact individuals and their families, making people more likely to participate in protests. Given these factors, it seems quite plausible that healthcare funding cuts could occur and trigger large protests meeting the specified criteria. The UK has a strong tradition of public demonstrations, and healthcare is a particularly sensitive issue. The relatively low threshold for what constitutes a \"large\" protest and the extended timeframe further increase the likelihood. However, there are also factors that could prevent this scenario: - The government might avoid making significant cuts to healthcare funding due to its political sensitivity. - If cuts are made, they might be implemented gradually or in a way that doesn't immediately trigger large-scale protests. - The government could rescind any announced cuts before protests occur if public backlash is severe.

Historical context: The UK has a history of protests related to healthcare funding and NHS issues. In recent years, there have been numerous demonstrations by healthcare workers and supporters of the NHS. 2. Current political climate: The UK is facing economic challenges, and healthcare funding is often a contentious issue. Any cuts to healthcare funding are likely to be met with significant public opposition. 3. Timeframe: The question covers a relatively short period (about one month from the creation date to the resolution date). This limited timeframe reduces the likelihood of large-scale protests being organized and executed. 4. Protest size threshold: The question specifies a minimum of 1,000 participants for a protest to be considered 'large.' This is a relatively low threshold for a country-wide issue, making it easier for a protest to meet the criteria. 5. Media coverage requirement: The question requires credible reports from at least two major international news outlets. Given the significance of healthcare funding in the UK, any large protest on this issue would likely receive substantial media attention. 6. Public sentiment: The NHS is a source of national pride in the UK, and any perceived threat to its funding or quality of service tends to provoke strong public reactions. 7. Organized opposition: There are well-established unions and advocacy groups in the UK that are quick to mobilize protests in response to healthcare funding issues. Considering these factors, it seems highly likely that if the UK government were to announce healthcare funding cuts, there would be at least one large protest meeting the specified criteria within the given timeframe. The low threshold for protest size, the sensitivity of the issue, and the existence of organized groups ready to mobilize make it probable that a protest would occur and be reported by major news outlets. However, there is some uncertainty due to the short timeframe and the possibility that the government might not announce or implement significant healthcare funding cuts during this period."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.003142234993865789, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0015711174969328945, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07920559147847751, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

None of these scenarios seem likely based on current information. 5. Time frame: The question asks about the appointment of a new president by August 2024, which is less than two years into Lula's four-year term. This is a relatively short period for such a significant change to occur without any current indications of instability or health issues. 6. Historical precedent: While Brazil has had presidents who did not complete their terms (e.g., Dilma Rousseff's impeachment in 2016), such events are not common and usually occur in the context of significant political crises. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Brazil will appoint a new President by August 2024. The current President, Lula, is serving a constitutionally mandated term, and there are no strong indications of any circumstances that would lead to his early departure from office. Barring any unforeseen major political upheavals or personal issues affecting Lula, the most probable scenario is that he will continue to serve as President through August 2024 and beyond."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "63364d1a-7fd6-4a36-a0c3-b66b84fcaf64", "title": "Will Brazil not appoint a new President by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, no new President is officially appointed in Brazil.

Given these factors, it is highly unlikely that Brazil will appoint a new President by August 2024. The current President, Lula, is expected to serve his full term until 2026, barring any unforeseen circumstances. The Brazilian political system and constitution provide for stability in the presidential office, and there are no current indications of any major disruptions that would necessitate a new appointment.

However, given South Carolina's political leanings, it's more likely to maintain or tighten restrictions rather than loosen them. 5. Legislative priorities: The state legislature may have other pressing issues to address, which could reduce the likelihood of revisiting this specific topic within the given timeframe. 6. Potential for legal challenges: If new legislation is proposed, it might face legal challenges, which could delay enactment beyond the resolution date. 7. Public opinion: While public opinion can influence legislation, changes in public sentiment typically take time to translate into policy changes. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that South Carolina will not enact a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024. The existing restrictions are already in line with the state's political leanings, and there's limited time and potentially limited political will to revisit this issue in the near future. However, the possibility of new legislation can't be completely ruled out, especially if there are significant national developments or pressure from within the state."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.015892700671463977, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.007946350335731989, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17789201674120497, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Smith's donation to Morehouse College), these are rare and usually for smaller institutions. Harvard's medical school is large and already well-funded. 5. Gates Foundation's focus: The Gates Foundation typically focuses on global health initiatives rather than funding elite institutions in developed countries. A donation to cover all Harvard medical students' tuition would be somewhat out of character for their usual giving strategy. 6. Lack of prior announcement: If such a significant donation were planned, it would likely have been announced well in advance of implementation. The absence of such an announcement by the time the question was posed suggests it's unlikely to happen within the given timeframe. 7. Partial coverage more likely: If a donation were made, it's more probable that it would cover tuition for a subset of students based on financial need or other criteria, rather than for all students. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the Gates Foundation would make a donation to cover full tuition for all Harvard medical students by July 2024. It's much more probable that any donation, if made, would be more limited in scope or targeted towards specific initiatives or groups of students."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.015752931572224682, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.007876465786112341, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.16552117772047367, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current political climate in Missouri: Missouri is a conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature and governor. The state has historically been anti-abortion, with some of the strictest abortion laws in the country. 2. Recent trends in abortion rights referendums: Several states have held referendums on abortion rights in recent years, including Kansas and Ohio, where voters supported protecting abortion rights. This trend might encourage abortion rights advocates in Missouri to push for a similar referendum. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a referendum by August 2024, which is about 14 months from now. This is a relatively short time frame to organize and conduct a statewide referendum, especially if it's not already in the planning stages. 4. Legal and procedural hurdles: Initiating a referendum in Missouri requires collecting a significant number of signatures and navigating complex legal processes. This can be time-consuming and challenging, especially given the state's conservative leanings. 5. Lack of current information: As of now, there doesn't seem to be widely reported information about a planned abortion rights referendum in Missouri for 2024. 6. Potential pushback: Given Missouri's conservative stance, there would likely be significant opposition to such a referendum from the state government and conservative groups. 7. National political context: The 2024 presidential election might influence state-level politics and could potentially impact the likelihood of such a referendum being held. Considering these factors, while it's not impossible for Missouri to conduct an abortion rights referendum by August 2024, it seems unlikely. The state's conservative leanings, the short time frame, and the lack of current information about such plans all weigh against it happening. However, the trend of successful abortion rights referendums in other conservative states and the potential influence of national politics provide some possibility that it could occur."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "63914151-3d26-4a54-b9d0-ee9cce08b17c", "title": "Will Missouri not conduct a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, Missouri does not conduct a public referendum specifically focused on enshrining protection for abortion rights in the state.

Current political climate in Missouri: Missouri is a conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature and governor.

Historical precedent: Missouri has not shown a tendency to hold referendums on controversial issues, especially those that go against the current political stance of the state government. 3. Time frame: The period from now until August 2024 is relatively short for organizing a statewide referendum, especially on such a contentious issue. 4. Lack of current momentum: As of now, there are no widely reported efforts or strong movements pushing for such a referendum in Missouri. 5. Comparison to other states: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights, these have typically been in more politically liberal states or swing states, unlike Missouri. 6. Legislative control: The Republican-controlled legislature is unlikely to initiate such a referendum, and the process for citizen-initiated referendums in Missouri is complex and time-consuming. 7. Public opinion: While national polls show support for abortion rights, Missouri's conservative lean suggests that there might not be overwhelming public demand for such a referendum.

Company policy and reputation: Most large companies, including Telus, typically have policies against paying ransoms to hackers, as it can encourage further attacks and may not guarantee the safe return or deletion of data. 3. Legal and ethical considerations: Paying hackers is often discouraged by law enforcement and cybersecurity experts, as it can be seen as funding criminal activities. 4. Public disclosure: Even if a payment were made, companies are often reluctant to publicly disclose such information due to potential reputational damage and legal implications. 5. Time frame: The question specifies a relatively short time frame (about a month from the creation date to the resolution date), which reduces the likelihood of such an event occurring and being publicly confirmed. 6.

Historical precedent: While some companies have admitted to paying ransoms in the past, it's relatively rare for large, established companies like Telus to do so publicly. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Telus would both make a payment to a hacker and publicly confirm it within the specified timeframe. The reputational risks and potential legal implications of such an admission would likely outweigh any benefits of disclosure.

While not impossible, a successful hack significant enough to warrant a large payment might be less likely for such a company. 7.
