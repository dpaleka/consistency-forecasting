Historical precedent: Coca-Cola has had product recalls in the past, but they are relatively rare. In 2019, they recalled Minute Maid products due to potential metal contamination, which shows that such incidents can occur. 2. Quality control measures: Coca-Cola is a large, established company with stringent quality control processes. They likely have multiple checks in place to prevent metal contamination, including metal detectors and x-ray machines in their production lines. 3. Supply chain complexity: Coca-Cola has a vast and complex supply chain, which increases the potential for contamination at various points in the production and distribution process. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 14 months (from the creation date to the resolution date), which is a significant amount of time for an incident to occur. 5. Frequency of metal contamination in the food industry: While not common, metal contamination does occur in the food industry. The FDA regularly reports recalls due to foreign objects, including metal, in food products. 6. Coca-Cola's product range: The company produces a wide variety of beverages and some food products, increasing the potential points of failure. 7. Reporting requirements: The question requires official confirmation and reporting by reputable news sources, which means any incident would likely need to be significant to meet these criteria. Given these factors, while a metal contamination recall is possible, it remains a relatively low probability event. Coca-Cola's quality control measures and experience in the industry work in their favor to prevent such incidents.

Product range: Danone produces a wide range of dairy products, baby food, and bottled water, which may have a higher risk of metal contamination due to the nature of their production processes. Coca-Cola primarily produces beverages, which might have a lower risk of metal contamination. 3. Time frame: The question covers a period of about two months (from the creation date to the resolution date), which is a relatively short time for such a specific event to occur. 4. Specificity of the contamination: Metal contamination is a specific type of contamination, which narrows the probability of occurrence compared to general contamination issues. 5. Recall frequency: Food recalls due to metal contamination do occur, but they are not extremely common. According to the FDA, metal contamination is one of the top reasons for food recalls, but it's not the most frequent. 6. Independent events: The probability of Danone recalling a product and Coca-Cola not recalling a product are independent events, which affects the overall probability. Considering these factors: - The probability of Danone recalling a product due to metal contamination in this timeframe might be around 10-15%. - The probability of Coca-Cola not recalling a product due to metal contamination is higher, perhaps around 95-98%. To resolve as YES, both events need to occur simultaneously. We multiply these probabilities: 0.15 * 0.95 = 0.1425 or about 14.25%.

The railroad industry has been under pressure to improve working conditions, which may accelerate negotiations. 2. Implementation of new scheduling systems: Large companies like Union Pacific typically take time to implement new systems, especially those affecting operations as critical as train scheduling. The process of designing, testing, and rolling out a new scheduling system could easily extend beyond August 2024, particularly if there are any technical challenges or if the company is focusing on other priorities. 3.

Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of this event occurring. Google's AI assistant will likely be widely used and under scrutiny during the election period. While Google will probably have safeguards in place, the complexity of election information and the potential for AI to make mistakes or be manipulated means there's a real possibility of misinformation being spread. However, the requirement for multiple credible sources to report on this specific issue sets a high bar. It's more likely that if there are issues, they might be isolated incidents or quickly corrected, potentially not reaching the threshold for widespread reporting.

Google's AI assistant not reported for spreading election misinformation by August 2024: Google has a strong reputation for developing responsible AI and has been working to combat misinformation. They are likely to be very cautious about their AI assistant's responses, especially regarding sensitive topics like elections. However, AI systems can sometimes produce unexpected outputs, and the 2024 US presidential election will be a high-stakes event with intense scrutiny on potential misinformation sources.

This suggests that the current political leadership is not inclined towards expanding abortion rights. 3. Referendum process in Indiana: Indiana does not have a process for citizen-initiated referendums at the state level. Any referendum would need to be approved by the state legislature, which is unlikely given its current composition. 4.

(a) Indiana conducting a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: The likelihood of this happening seems low. Indiana is a predominantly conservative state, and its legislature has recently passed strict abortion laws. There's no current indication that the state government is planning to hold a referendum on abortion rights. Moreover, organizing a statewide referendum is a complex and time-consuming process, and with the given timeframe (by August 2024), it seems unlikely that such a process would be initiated and completed in time. However, public opinion on abortion rights can shift rapidly, so while unlikely, it's not impossible. (b) Colorado enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024: This scenario seems more plausible. Colorado is generally considered a progressive state, especially on LGBTQ+ issues. The state has previously enacted laws protecting LGBTQ+ rights. However, it's important to note that Colorado already has relatively progressive laws regarding transgender healthcare. In 2021, Colorado became the first state to require insurance companies to cover transition-related care for transgender people, including youth. Given this existing progressive stance, there might not be a pressing need for new legislation. However, as the landscape of transgender rights and healthcare is rapidly evolving, it's possible that Colorado might enact new laws to further protect or clarify rights for transgender youth. Combining these factors: The probability of (a) happening is quite low, while the probability of (b) is moderate. Since only one of these needs to occur for the question to resolve as YES, we need to consider the probability of at least one of these events happening. Given the political climate and the timeframe, I would estimate the probability of (a) at around 10% and the probability of (b) at around 40%.

However, there are concerns about a potential economic slowdown or recession. The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes to combat inflation could lead to increased unemployment. Still, reaching 275,000+ for four consecutive weeks would represent a significant deterioration in the job market.

(b) No other U.S. state adopting a Medicaid plan with a community engagement requirement by July 2024: Community engagement requirements (often called work requirements) for Medicaid have been controversial and faced legal challenges. The Biden administration has been opposed to such requirements, making it unlikely that many states would pursue them. However, some conservative states might still attempt to implement such plans. Given that Georgia has already adopted such a plan, it's possible that other states with similar political leanings might follow suit. The relatively short timeframe (about a year) makes it somewhat less likely that another state would fully adopt and implement such a plan, but it's not impossible. Considering both conditions together: For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must occur, which makes the overall probability lower than either individual probability. The jobless claims condition seems less likely than the Medicaid plan condition.

Lack of specific information: The question doesn't mention any particular company or ongoing relocation plans, which suggests this is a speculative scenario rather than based on known information. 7. Economic uncertainty: The current economic climate, including inflation and potential recession fears, might make companies more cautious about major moves. 8. Remote work trends: The increase in remote work following the COVID-19 pandemic might reduce the urgency for physical relocations. Considering these factors, while Austin is an attractive destination for tech companies, the short timeframe and the complexity of a full headquarters relocation make it unlikely that a major cybersecurity company will complete such a move by July 2024. The lack of specific information about any ongoing plans further reduces the probability. However, given the dynamic nature of the tech industry and Austin's growing appeal, it's not entirely implausible. I would assign a low but non-negligible probability to this event occurring."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "a95a1941-9e44-4bb2-9dc5-4669364c3aa5", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Google will face additional legal actions from the U.S. government by August 2024, and (b) No major cybersecurity company will fully relocate its headquarters to Austin, Texas by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) By August 31, 2024, Google becomes subject to new legal actions initiated by any U.S. government entity.

Given the ongoing scrutiny of big tech companies and the increasing focus on regulating the digital economy, it's quite likely that Google will face new legal actions within the next year.

(b) No major cybersecurity company fully relocating its headquarters to Austin, Texas by July 2024: Austin has been attracting tech companies due to its lower cost of living, favorable business environment, and growing tech ecosystem. However, fully relocating a company's headquarters is a significant undertaking that requires extensive planning and resources. Most major cybersecurity companies are already established in other tech hubs, and a complete relocation within a year is relatively rare. Additionally, the cybersecurity industry often benefits from proximity to government agencies and other tech giants, which are more commonly found in places like Silicon Valley, Washington D.C., or New York. I would estimate the probability of no major cybersecurity company fully relocating to Austin by July 2024 at around 85%. To resolve as YES, both conditions must be met.

Public opinion: While Arkansas is a conservative state, extreme abortion bans can sometimes face public backlash, which legislators might consider. 6. Legal challenges: Any new abortion ban would likely face immediate legal challenges, which might make some legislators hesitant to pass such a law. 7. Exceptions: The question allows for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life, which aligns with many conservative viewpoints and makes passage more likely than an absolute ban with no exceptions. 8.

Part A: Adobe announcing plans to increase its AI-related workforce by July 2024. Adobe is a major player in the software industry and has been increasingly focusing on AI integration in its products. Given the current trends in the tech industry and the growing importance of AI, it's quite likely that Adobe would want to expand its AI capabilities. However, there are a few factors to consider: 1. Adobe has already been investing in AI, so they might not need a significant workforce increase. 2. The timeframe is relatively short (about a month from the question's creation date to the resolution date). 3. Economic conditions and potential tech industry slowdowns could affect hiring plans.

Part B: California not receiving over $300 million in federal grants for electric vehicle projects by July 2024. This part is more challenging to predict due to several factors: 1.

Given this existing policy and the trend among elite universities to expand financial aid, it's plausible that Stanford might increase this threshold to $100,000. However, such a significant change typically requires careful planning and budgeting, which might take more than a year to implement. The short timeframe (about one month from the question's creation to the resolution date) makes this less likely to occur by July 2024. b) South Carolina implementing a free community college plan: As of 2023, South Carolina does not have a statewide free community college program. While some states have implemented such programs, South Carolina has not shown significant movement in this direction.

The company has a history of addressing such issues, and implementing a new scheduling system is a plausible step to take.

Amtrak scheduling system: - Amtrak has been facing ongoing issues with engineer scheduling and work-life balance. - There's increasing pressure on transportation companies to improve working conditions. - Implementing a new scheduling system is a concrete step that Amtrak can take to address these concerns. - The timeframe (by August 2024) allows sufficient time for Amtrak to develop and implement such a system. 3. General considerations: - The resolution criteria are specific but achievable, requiring public announcements and confirmation from reputable sources. - Only one of the two scenarios needs to occur for a YES resolution. - The railroad industry has been under scrutiny for safety and working conditions, increasing the likelihood of action.

South Korean battery company beginning construction in Michigan: South Korea is a leader in battery technology, with companies like LG Chem, Samsung SDI, and SK Innovation. The US, particularly Michigan, has been actively courting battery manufacturers to support the growing electric vehicle industry. There's a strong incentive for South Korean companies to establish a presence in the US market, and Michigan offers a strategic location with its automotive industry infrastructure. However, large-scale factory projects can face delays due to various factors such as regulatory approvals, funding issues, or supply chain disruptions. The timeframe of about 14 months (from now until August 2024) is relatively short for such a major project to move from planning to actual construction. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 60%. 2. Google not announcing additional layoffs: Google's initial 8% layoff was significant, and tech companies often try to make such cuts in one go to minimize ongoing uncertainty and disruption. However, the tech industry is currently facing challenges, and economic conditions remain uncertain. Google's parent company, Alphabet, has been focusing on cost-cutting measures, and if economic conditions worsen or if their strategic priorities shift, they might consider further layoffs. That said, announcing additional major layoffs so soon after a significant cut could be damaging to morale and public perception.

Companies sometimes implement layoffs in stages to minimize negative publicity.

I'd estimate this at about 15% probability. b) A major South Korean battery company beginning construction of a factory in Michigan: This scenario seems more likely. The electric vehicle industry is growing rapidly, and there's a strong push for domestic battery production in the US. Michigan, with its automotive heritage, is an attractive location for such facilities. South Korean companies like LG Chem, SK Innovation, and Samsung SDI are major players in the battery industry and have shown interest in expanding their US presence. The Biden administration's focus on clean energy and domestic manufacturing also supports this possibility.

Time frame: The question asks about resumption by July 2024, which gives approximately 6 months from the time of the pause for the government to reconsider its position. 3. Economic pressure: LNG exports are a significant economic driver, and there's likely to be substantial pressure from the energy industry and certain political factions to resume considerations quickly. 4.

Let's analyze each condition separately: a) BYD's quarterly net income increases by over 20% year-over-year: BYD is a leading Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer that has been experiencing significant growth in recent years. The EV market is expanding rapidly, especially in China, which could contribute to BYD's continued growth. However, there are several factors to consider: - Increasing competition in the EV market - Potential economic slowdowns or supply chain disruptions - The company's already high growth rate, which may be challenging to maintain Given BYD's strong position in the market and the overall growth of the EV industry, there's a good chance they could achieve a 20% year-over-year increase in net income for at least one quarter by July 2024. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 70%. b) The U.S. government does not resume consideration of liquefied natural gas export projects: This condition is more complex due to various political and economic factors: - The Biden administration has paused new LNG export approvals to assess their impact on climate change, energy security, and the economy. - There's significant pressure from the oil and gas industry to resume these projects. - The upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election could influence this decision. - Global energy demands and geopolitical situations may also play a role. Given the current pause and the relatively short timeframe until July 2024, there's a decent chance that the government won't resume consideration of these projects by then.

(a) U.S. government resuming consideration of LNG export projects: The U.S. government paused approvals for new LNG export terminals in January 2024 to study their impact on climate change, energy security, and costs. This pause was significant but not permanent. Given the importance of LNG exports for U.S. energy policy and international relations, there's a moderate chance the government might resume considerations within a year. However, the timeframe is relatively short (by July 2024), which reduces the likelihood. (b) BYD's quarterly net income increasing by over 20% year-over-year: BYD is a leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer that has shown strong growth in recent years. The electric vehicle market is expanding rapidly, especially in China. BYD has been consistently improving its market share and financial performance. A 20% year-over-year increase in quarterly net income is significant but not unrealistic for a company in a high-growth sector like EVs. BYD has achieved such growth rates in the past, and the EV market continues to expand. Combining these factors: The LNG export project resumption has a moderate chance but is constrained by the short timeframe. BYD's potential for 20% net income growth seems more likely given its industry position and past performance.

(a) Union Pacific implementing a new scheduling system for passenger train services: Union Pacific is primarily a freight railroad company, with limited involvement in passenger services. Most passenger rail services in the US are operated by Amtrak or regional transit authorities. Union Pacific's focus is mainly on freight operations. Given this, it's less likely that they would implement a new scheduling system specifically for passenger train services. However, if there's increasing pressure for improved coordination with passenger services that use their tracks, there's a small possibility they might introduce such a system. Probability for (a): Low, around 0.2 (b) Union Pacific not implementing a new scheduling system for train engineers in Texas: Union Pacific has a significant presence in Texas, and the state is crucial for their freight operations. Given the ongoing challenges in the railroad industry regarding worker schedules and quality of life issues, it's more likely that Union Pacific would implement new scheduling systems to address these concerns. However, they might choose to implement such changes across their entire network rather than focusing on a single state. The probability of them not implementing a new system specifically for Texas is moderate. Probability for (b): Moderate, around 0.6 For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met.

(a) FTC investigation completion: The FTC has been increasingly active in investigating tech companies and their practices, including pricing practices. However, major investigations often take considerable time to complete, sometimes years. Given that we're looking at a timeline until July 2024 (about a year from now), it's possible but not certain that such a major investigation would be completed and announced by then. The requirement for it to involve at least five major companies adds complexity and potentially extends the timeline. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring by July 2024 at around 60%. (b) Georgia abortion rights referendum: Georgia is a traditionally conservative state that has recently passed restrictive abortion laws. While there's growing national debate on abortion rights, especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, there's no current indication that Georgia is planning to hold a referendum on enshrining abortion rights. Conservative control of the state government makes it unlikely that they would initiate such a referendum. However, grassroots movements could potentially push for one. Given the political climate in Georgia and the lack of current momentum for such a referendum, I'd estimate the probability of Georgia not holding an abortion rights referendum by August 2024 at about 85%.

There's no current indication that the state government is planning to hold a referendum to enshrine abortion rights. Such a move would be a significant shift in the state's political stance.

The FTC has been increasingly focused on consumer protection in the digital age, including issues related to data privacy and algorithmic pricing. In recent years, there has been growing concern about companies using personal data for price discrimination. The FTC has shown interest in investigating such practices. However, major investigations involving multiple large companies can be time-consuming and complex.

The House of Lords has a history of challenging government policies, especially on controversial issues.

Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut announcement by August 2024, which is more than a year away from the current date. This provides a significant time window for economic conditions to change and for the BoE to adjust its policy stance. Historical precedent: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates immediately after a tightening cycle. They often maintain higher rates for a period to ensure inflation is under control before considering cuts. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The extended time frame increases the likelihood, as it allows for potential improvements in inflation and economic conditions. However, the BoE will likely be cautious about cutting rates too soon after a tightening cycle, especially if inflation remains above target.

Let's estimate this probability at around 60%. b) Bank of England not announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: The Bank of England's interest rate decisions are influenced by various economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic conditions. As of now (June 2023), the Bank of England has been raising interest rates to combat high inflation. For them to consider cutting rates by August 2024, there would need to be a significant change in economic conditions, such as a sharp economic downturn or a rapid decline in inflation. While economic predictions over a year into the future are inherently uncertain, the likelihood of no rate cut by August 2024 seems moderately high, perhaps around 70%.

As of now (June 2023), the BoE's base rate is at 4.5%. While inflation has been showing signs of easing, it's still above the target of 2%. The BoE typically doesn't cut rates until inflation is under control and economic growth needs stimulation. Given the current economic climate and inflation trends, it's possible that by mid-2024, inflation could be sufficiently under control for the BoE to consider a rate cut.

(b) GNC Holdings emerging from bankruptcy by July 31, 2024: GNC Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2020 and has been working on restructuring since then. The company has already made significant progress in its reorganization efforts, including closing underperforming stores and focusing on its core business. Typically, Chapter 11 bankruptcies can take anywhere from several months to a few years to resolve. Given that GNC filed for bankruptcy in 2020, it's reasonable to expect that they could emerge from bankruptcy by July 2024, which would be four years after filing.

However, Spotify has been working on improving its profitability and has shown some positive financial results recently. The likelihood of additional layoffs depends on Spotify's financial performance and market conditions over the next year.

Reserve Bank of India announcing a reduction in its key interest rate: As of June 2023, the RBI has maintained a repo rate of 6.5% for some time. The Indian economy has been showing signs of growth, and inflation has been a concern. Central banks typically reduce interest rates to stimulate economic growth during slowdowns or recessions. While India's economy is growing, there are global economic uncertainties that could impact it.

However, given the current economic conditions and the RBI's focus on controlling inflation, a rate cut seems less likely in the near term.

(a) Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure exceeding 0.5% monthly increase: The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), has been relatively stable in recent months. As of the latest data, monthly increases have been well below 0.5%. For this condition to be met, we would need to see a significant spike in inflation. While not impossible, such a large monthly increase is relatively rare and would likely require a major economic shock or policy change. The probability of this occurring in any single month between now and July 2024 is low, but not negligible. Let's estimate this at around 15-20%. (b) Italian economy entering a recession: Italy's economy has been facing challenges, including high public debt, political instability, and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country has experienced periods of economic contraction in recent years. However, recent forecasts from organizations like the IMF and the European Commission suggest modest growth for Italy in the near term. That said, the Italian economy remains vulnerable to external shocks and internal political issues. The probability of Italy entering a recession by July 2024 is higher than average but still not a certainty. Let's estimate this at around 30-35%. For both conditions to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities. Even if we take the higher estimates for both (20% for inflation spike and 35% for Italian recession), the combined probability would be 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07 or 7%. However, it's worth noting that these events are not entirely independent. A global economic shock that could cause a significant inflation spike in the US might also increase the likelihood of a recession in Italy. This positive correlation slightly increases the joint probability. Considering all these factors, I would estimate the probability of both events occurring by July 2024 to be slightly higher than the simple multiplication would suggest, but still quite low."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "ab979dde-5353-4b8a-8396-b69864e4de46", "title": "Will either of the following occur by July 2024: (a) The Italian economy avoids a recession, or (b) The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure shows a monthly increase exceeding 0.5%?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) The Italian economy does not enter a recession by July 31, 2024, which means it does not experience two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth as reported by the Italian National Institute of Statistics between October 1, 2023, and July 31, 2024.

However, recent data shows some resilience. The Italian economy grew by 0.6% in Q1 2023, surpassing expectations. While there are still risks, including potential energy shortages and global economic slowdown, the likelihood of Italy avoiding a recession seems moderately high. The European Central Bank's policies and potential EU support also factor into this assessment. b) Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure showing a monthly increase exceeding 0.5%: The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, has been showing signs of cooling in recent months. However, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. While the trend is downward, there's still a possibility of unexpected spikes due to factors such as energy prices, supply chain disruptions, or unforeseen economic shocks. It's important to note that a single month exceeding 0.5% would satisfy this condition, and we're looking at a period of about 10 months. Combining these factors: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs, which increases the overall probability. The timeframe (until July 2024) is relatively long, providing more opportunity for either event to happen. The Italian economy seems more likely to avoid a recession than to enter one, while the inflation measure has a lower but still significant chance of exceeding 0.5% in a single month over this period.

Let's analyze each part separately: a) France appointing a new President by August 2024: The current President of France is Emmanuel Macron, who was re-elected in 2022 for a five-year term. His term is set to end in 2027. Barring any unforeseen circumstances such as resignation, impeachment, or death in office, it is highly unlikely that France will appoint a new President by August 2024. The French political system is stable, and there are no indications of a potential change in presidency within this timeframe. b) Bank of England's base rate remaining at or above 5.00% in August 2024: As of October 2023, the Bank of England's base rate is at 5.25%. The bank has been raising interest rates to combat inflation. While it's difficult to predict future economic conditions with certainty, there are several factors to consider: 1. Current inflation rates are high, and the Bank of England is committed to bringing inflation down to its 2% target. 2. Economic forecasts suggest that interest rates might remain elevated for an extended period to control inflation. 3. However, there's also a possibility that economic conditions might change, potentially leading to rate cuts if inflation is brought under control or if there's an economic downturn. Given these factors, there's a significant chance that the base rate will remain at or above 5.00% in August 2024, although it's not certain. Considering both events, the probability of at least one occurring is primarily driven by the likelihood of the Bank of England's base rate remaining at or above 5.00%. While the appointment of a new French President is highly unlikely, the interest rate scenario is more probable.

Market pressure: There's increasing global pressure on pharmaceutical companies to make life-saving drugs more accessible, especially in developing countries. However, companies are often reluctant to give up patent rights prematurely due to the significant investment in research and development. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is only about a month from the question's creation date. This very short timeframe makes it less likely for Astellas to make such a significant decision, unless it was already in the works. 4.

Let's analyze each part separately: 1. Mexican authorities declaring the dismantling of La Familia Michoacana by July 2024: La Familia Michoacana is a well-established drug cartel that has been operating for many years. While Mexican authorities have had some success in targeting drug cartels, completely dismantling a major cartel within a year is a significant challenge. Drug cartels are known for their resilience and ability to adapt to law enforcement efforts. Moreover, official declarations of a cartel's dismantling are relatively rare, as authorities are often cautious about making such definitive statements. The timeframe (by July 2024) is also relatively short for such a major accomplishment. Therefore, the probability of this condition being met is quite low. 2. FDA rejecting or delaying approval of MDMA for PTSD treatment beyond August 2024: MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD has shown promising results in clinical trials, and there has been growing support for its potential therapeutic use. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, which typically expedites the review process. Several Phase 3 clinical trials have been completed or are nearing completion. Given the current trajectory and the increasing recognition of the need for innovative PTSD treatments, it seems more likely that the FDA would approve MDMA for PTSD treatment by August 2024 rather than reject or delay it. However, the regulatory process can be unpredictable, and there's always a possibility of unexpected delays or concerns arising during the review process.

FDA approval of MDMA for PTSD therapy by August 2024: MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD has shown promising results in clinical trials. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has been at the forefront of this research and has been working towards FDA approval. In May 2021, MAPS announced positive results from its second Phase 3 trial of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. The FDA has also granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to MDMA for PTSD, which can expedite the review process. However, the FDA approval process is rigorous and can be unpredictable. While the research is promising, there's no guarantee that approval will come by August 2024. The timeline seems tight, but not impossible.

While Mexican authorities have had some successes in targeting cartel leadership, completely dismantling such organizations has proven challenging. The timeframe given (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a significant achievement. Moreover, even if substantial progress is made against the cartel, authorities might be hesitant to declare it fully dismantled unless they are absolutely certain. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 20%.

(a) Large protests in the UK in response to healthcare funding cuts: The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has been under significant strain for years, with ongoing debates about funding and efficiency. Given the current economic challenges and the potential for austerity measures, it's plausible that the government might consider healthcare funding cuts. Such cuts would likely be highly controversial and could easily spark large-scale protests. The UK has a history of public demonstrations, especially when it comes to protecting public services. However, the timeframe is relatively short (about a month), which reduces the likelihood of such a specific event occurring. (b) The Central Bank of Israel not announcing an interest rate cut: Israel's economy and monetary policy are influenced by various factors, including global economic conditions, local inflation rates, and geopolitical situations. As of now, without specific information about Israel's current economic state or future projections, it's difficult to predict whether they would need to cut interest rates. Generally, central banks are cautious about frequent rate changes, and a month is a short time for significant economic shifts warranting a rate cut. Therefore, the probability of them not announcing a rate cut in this period is relatively high. Combining these factors: For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. The second condition (b) seems more likely to occur than the first (a). The short timeframe (about a month) significantly reduces the likelihood of both events happening as specified.

The Bank of Israel has been raising rates to combat inflation. However, by July 2024, more than a year from now, the economic landscape could change significantly. If inflation shows signs of cooling or if economic growth slows, there could be pressure to cut rates. Given the uncertain global economic outlook and the potential for a recession, there's a moderate chance that Israel might need to cut rates to stimulate the economy by mid-2024. b) Large protests in the UK in response to healthcare funding cuts: The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has been under significant strain, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There have already been protests and strikes related to healthcare funding and working conditions. The UK government faces ongoing pressure to increase healthcare funding, and any attempts to cut funding would likely be met with strong opposition. Given the importance of healthcare to the British public and the history of protests in the UK, there's a substantial chance of large protests occurring if the government announces significant healthcare funding cuts. Combining these scenarios, we have two independent events that both have a reasonable chance of occurring. Even if one doesn't happen, the other could still trigger a YES resolution.

Current rates: As of June 2023, the average 15-year fixed mortgage rate is around 5.75-6.00%, according to recent data. This is already above the 5.5% threshold mentioned in the question. 2. Federal Reserve policy: The Fed has been aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation. While they may slow down or pause rate hikes, it's unlikely they will significantly lower rates by August 2024, given persistent inflation concerns. 3. Inflation outlook: Inflation has been moderating but remains above the Fed's 2% target. It's expected to continue decreasing gradually, but may still be a concern in 2024. 4. Economic growth: The U.S. economy has shown resilience, with steady job growth and GDP expansion. A strong economy typically supports higher interest rates. 5. Global economic factors: Geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainties can influence U.S. interest rates, but their impact is hard to predict over a year in advance. 6. Housing market: The housing market has cooled somewhat due to high mortgage rates, but demand remains relatively strong in many areas. Given these factors, it seems likely that mortgage rates will remain elevated through 2024. While there's a possibility of rates decreasing if economic conditions change dramatically, the current starting point above 5.5% and the overall economic outlook suggest that rates are more likely to stay above 5.5% than to fall below it by August 2024. However, we must also consider the uncertainty of economic forecasts over a year into the future. Unexpected events or policy changes could alter the trajectory of interest rates.

Condition (a) - Nevada's minimum wage for fast food workers: As of now (June 2024), Nevada's minimum wage for fast food workers is $11 per hour. The question asks if this will remain the same through July 2024, which is only one month away from the current date. Given the short timeframe, it's unlikely that there would be a sudden change in minimum wage policy. Minimum wage changes are typically announced well in advance and often implemented at the beginning of a new year or fiscal year. Therefore, the probability of this condition being met is quite high, perhaps around 0.95. Condition (b) - 15-year mortgage rate not exceeding 5.5% by August 2024: This condition is more challenging to predict due to the volatility of interest rates and the longer time frame (about two months from now). As of June 2024, let's assume the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is around 5% (this is a hypothetical assumption as we don't have the exact current rate). For this condition to be met, the rate must not exceed 5.5% at any point during August 2024. Factors to consider: 1. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy: If the Fed continues to fight inflation, they might keep interest rates high or even increase them. 2. Economic indicators: Inflation rates, employment data, and GDP growth can influence mortgage rates. 3. Global economic factors: International events and economic conditions can impact U.S. interest rates. Given these factors and the relatively small buffer between our assumed current rate (5%) and the threshold (5.5%), there's a significant chance that rates could exceed 5.5% by August 2024. However, it's not a certainty. Let's estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 0.6. Joint Probability: For both conditions to be met, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.95 * 0.6 = 0.57.
