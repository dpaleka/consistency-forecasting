Historical precedent: Coca-Cola has had product recalls in the past, but they are relatively rare. In 2019, they recalled Minute Maid products due to potential metal contamination, which shows that such incidents can occur. 2. Quality control measures: Coca-Cola is a large, established company with stringent quality control processes. They likely have multiple checks in place to prevent metal contamination, including metal detectors and x-ray machines in their production lines. 3. Supply chain complexity: Coca-Cola has a vast and complex supply chain, which increases the potential for contamination at various points in the production and distribution process. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 14 months (from the creation date to the resolution date), which is a significant amount of time for an incident to occur. 5. Frequency of metal contamination in the food industry: While not common, metal contamination does occur in the food industry. The FDA regularly reports recalls due to foreign objects, including metal, in food products. 6. Coca-Cola's product range: The company produces a wide variety of beverages and some food products, increasing the potential points of failure. 7. Reporting requirements: The question requires official confirmation and reporting by reputable news sources, which means any incident would likely need to be significant to meet these criteria. Given these factors, while a metal contamination recall is possible, it remains a relatively low probability event. Coca-Cola's quality control measures and experience in the industry work in their favor to prevent such incidents.

Product range: Danone produces a wide range of dairy products, baby food, and bottled water, which may have a higher risk of metal contamination due to the nature of their production processes. Coca-Cola primarily produces beverages, which might have a lower risk of metal contamination. 3. Time frame: The question covers a period of about two months (from the creation date to the resolution date), which is a relatively short time for such a specific event to occur. 4. Specificity of the contamination: Metal contamination is a specific type of contamination, which narrows the probability of occurrence compared to general contamination issues. 5. Recall frequency: Food recalls due to metal contamination do occur, but they are not extremely common. According to the FDA, metal contamination is one of the top reasons for food recalls, but it's not the most frequent. 6. Independent events: The probability of Danone recalling a product and Coca-Cola not recalling a product are independent events, which affects the overall probability. Considering these factors: - The probability of Danone recalling a product due to metal contamination in this timeframe might be around 10-15%. - The probability of Coca-Cola not recalling a product due to metal contamination is higher, perhaps around 95-98%. To resolve as YES, both events need to occur simultaneously. We multiply these probabilities: 0.15 * 0.95 = 0.1425 or about 14.25%.

The railroad industry has been under pressure to improve working conditions, which may accelerate negotiations. 2. Implementation of new scheduling systems: Large companies like Union Pacific typically take time to implement new systems, especially those affecting operations as critical as train scheduling. The process of designing, testing, and rolling out a new scheduling system could easily extend beyond August 2024, particularly if there are any technical challenges or if the company is focusing on other priorities. 3.

Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of this event occurring. Google's AI assistant will likely be widely used and under scrutiny during the election period. While Google will probably have safeguards in place, the complexity of election information and the potential for AI to make mistakes or be manipulated means there's a real possibility of misinformation being spread. However, the requirement for multiple credible sources to report on this specific issue sets a high bar. It's more likely that if there are issues, they might be isolated incidents or quickly corrected, potentially not reaching the threshold for widespread reporting.

Google's AI assistant not reported for spreading election misinformation by August 2024: Google has a strong reputation for developing responsible AI and has been working to combat misinformation. They are likely to be very cautious about their AI assistant's responses, especially regarding sensitive topics like elections. However, AI systems can sometimes produce unexpected outputs, and the 2024 US presidential election will be a high-stakes event with intense scrutiny on potential misinformation sources.

This suggests that the current political leadership is not inclined towards expanding abortion rights. 3. Referendum process in Indiana: Indiana does not have a process for citizen-initiated referendums at the state level. Any referendum would need to be approved by the state legislature, which is unlikely given its current composition. 4.

(a) Indiana conducting a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: The likelihood of this happening seems low. Indiana is a predominantly conservative state, and its legislature has recently passed strict abortion laws. There's no current indication that the state government is planning to hold a referendum on abortion rights. Moreover, organizing a statewide referendum is a complex and time-consuming process, and with the given timeframe (by August 2024), it seems unlikely that such a process would be initiated and completed in time. However, public opinion on abortion rights can shift rapidly, so while unlikely, it's not impossible. (b) Colorado enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024: This scenario seems more plausible. Colorado is generally considered a progressive state, especially on LGBTQ+ issues. The state has previously enacted laws protecting LGBTQ+ rights. However, it's important to note that Colorado already has relatively progressive laws regarding transgender healthcare. In 2021, Colorado became the first state to require insurance companies to cover transition-related care for transgender people, including youth. Given this existing progressive stance, there might not be a pressing need for new legislation. However, as the landscape of transgender rights and healthcare is rapidly evolving, it's possible that Colorado might enact new laws to further protect or clarify rights for transgender youth. Combining these factors: The probability of (a) happening is quite low, while the probability of (b) is moderate. Since only one of these needs to occur for the question to resolve as YES, we need to consider the probability of at least one of these events happening. Given the political climate and the timeframe, I would estimate the probability of (a) at around 10% and the probability of (b) at around 40%.

However, there are concerns about a potential economic slowdown or recession. The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes to combat inflation could lead to increased unemployment. Still, reaching 275,000+ for four consecutive weeks would represent a significant deterioration in the job market.

(b) No other U.S. state adopting a Medicaid plan with a community engagement requirement by July 2024: Community engagement requirements (often called work requirements) for Medicaid have been controversial and faced legal challenges. The Biden administration has been opposed to such requirements, making it unlikely that many states would pursue them. However, some conservative states might still attempt to implement such plans. Given that Georgia has already adopted such a plan, it's possible that other states with similar political leanings might follow suit. The relatively short timeframe (about a year) makes it somewhat less likely that another state would fully adopt and implement such a plan, but it's not impossible. Considering both conditions together: For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must occur, which makes the overall probability lower than either individual probability. The jobless claims condition seems less likely than the Medicaid plan condition.

Lack of specific information: The question doesn't mention any particular company or ongoing relocation plans, which suggests this is a speculative scenario rather than based on known information. 7. Economic uncertainty: The current economic climate, including inflation and potential recession fears, might make companies more cautious about major moves. 8. Remote work trends: The increase in remote work following the COVID-19 pandemic might reduce the urgency for physical relocations. Considering these factors, while Austin is an attractive destination for tech companies, the short timeframe and the complexity of a full headquarters relocation make it unlikely that a major cybersecurity company will complete such a move by July 2024. The lack of specific information about any ongoing plans further reduces the probability. However, given the dynamic nature of the tech industry and Austin's growing appeal, it's not entirely implausible. I would assign a low but non-negligible probability to this event occurring."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "a95a1941-9e44-4bb2-9dc5-4669364c3aa5", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Google will face additional legal actions from the U.S. government by August 2024, and (b) No major cybersecurity company will fully relocate its headquarters to Austin, Texas by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) By August 31, 2024, Google becomes subject to new legal actions initiated by any U.S. government entity.

Given the ongoing scrutiny of big tech companies and the increasing focus on regulating the digital economy, it's quite likely that Google will face new legal actions within the next year.

(b) No major cybersecurity company fully relocating its headquarters to Austin, Texas by July 2024: Austin has been attracting tech companies due to its lower cost of living, favorable business environment, and growing tech ecosystem. However, fully relocating a company's headquarters is a significant undertaking that requires extensive planning and resources. Most major cybersecurity companies are already established in other tech hubs, and a complete relocation within a year is relatively rare. Additionally, the cybersecurity industry often benefits from proximity to government agencies and other tech giants, which are more commonly found in places like Silicon Valley, Washington D.C., or New York. I would estimate the probability of no major cybersecurity company fully relocating to Austin by July 2024 at around 85%. To resolve as YES, both conditions must be met.

Public opinion: While Arkansas is a conservative state, extreme abortion bans can sometimes face public backlash, which legislators might consider. 6. Legal challenges: Any new abortion ban would likely face immediate legal challenges, which might make some legislators hesitant to pass such a law. 7. Exceptions: The question allows for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life, which aligns with many conservative viewpoints and makes passage more likely than an absolute ban with no exceptions. 8.

Part A: Adobe announcing plans to increase its AI-related workforce by July 2024. Adobe is a major player in the software industry and has been increasingly focusing on AI integration in its products. Given the current trends in the tech industry and the growing importance of AI, it's quite likely that Adobe would want to expand its AI capabilities. However, there are a few factors to consider: 1. Adobe has already been investing in AI, so they might not need a significant workforce increase. 2. The timeframe is relatively short (about a month from the question's creation date to the resolution date). 3. Economic conditions and potential tech industry slowdowns could affect hiring plans.

Part B: California not receiving over $300 million in federal grants for electric vehicle projects by July 2024. This part is more challenging to predict due to several factors: 1.

Given this existing policy and the trend among elite universities to expand financial aid, it's plausible that Stanford might increase this threshold to $100,000. However, such a significant change typically requires careful planning and budgeting, which might take more than a year to implement. The short timeframe (about one month from the question's creation to the resolution date) makes this less likely to occur by July 2024. b) South Carolina implementing a free community college plan: As of 2023, South Carolina does not have a statewide free community college program. While some states have implemented such programs, South Carolina has not shown significant movement in this direction.

The company has a history of addressing such issues, and implementing a new scheduling system is a plausible step to take.

Amtrak scheduling system: - Amtrak has been facing ongoing issues with engineer scheduling and work-life balance. - There's increasing pressure on transportation companies to improve working conditions. - Implementing a new scheduling system is a concrete step that Amtrak can take to address these concerns. - The timeframe (by August 2024) allows sufficient time for Amtrak to develop and implement such a system. 3. General considerations: - The resolution criteria are specific but achievable, requiring public announcements and confirmation from reputable sources. - Only one of the two scenarios needs to occur for a YES resolution. - The railroad industry has been under scrutiny for safety and working conditions, increasing the likelihood of action.

South Korean battery company beginning construction in Michigan: South Korea is a leader in battery technology, with companies like LG Chem, Samsung SDI, and SK Innovation. The US, particularly Michigan, has been actively courting battery manufacturers to support the growing electric vehicle industry. There's a strong incentive for South Korean companies to establish a presence in the US market, and Michigan offers a strategic location with its automotive industry infrastructure. However, large-scale factory projects can face delays due to various factors such as regulatory approvals, funding issues, or supply chain disruptions. The timeframe of about 14 months (from now until August 2024) is relatively short for such a major project to move from planning to actual construction. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 60%. 2. Google not announcing additional layoffs: Google's initial 8% layoff was significant, and tech companies often try to make such cuts in one go to minimize ongoing uncertainty and disruption. However, the tech industry is currently facing challenges, and economic conditions remain uncertain. Google's parent company, Alphabet, has been focusing on cost-cutting measures, and if economic conditions worsen or if their strategic priorities shift, they might consider further layoffs. That said, announcing additional major layoffs so soon after a significant cut could be damaging to morale and public perception.

Companies sometimes implement layoffs in stages to minimize negative publicity.

I'd estimate this at about 15% probability. b) A major South Korean battery company beginning construction of a factory in Michigan: This scenario seems more likely. The electric vehicle industry is growing rapidly, and there's a strong push for domestic battery production in the US. Michigan, with its automotive heritage, is an attractive location for such facilities. South Korean companies like LG Chem, SK Innovation, and Samsung SDI are major players in the battery industry and have shown interest in expanding their US presence. The Biden administration's focus on clean energy and domestic manufacturing also supports this possibility.

Time frame: The question asks about resumption by July 2024, which gives approximately 6 months from the time of the pause for the government to reconsider its position. 3. Economic pressure: LNG exports are a significant economic driver, and there's likely to be substantial pressure from the energy industry and certain political factions to resume considerations quickly. 4.

Let's analyze each condition separately: a) BYD's quarterly net income increases by over 20% year-over-year: BYD is a leading Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer that has been experiencing significant growth in recent years. The EV market is expanding rapidly, especially in China, which could contribute to BYD's continued growth. However, there are several factors to consider: - Increasing competition in the EV market - Potential economic slowdowns or supply chain disruptions - The company's already high growth rate, which may be challenging to maintain Given BYD's strong position in the market and the overall growth of the EV industry, there's a good chance they could achieve a 20% year-over-year increase in net income for at least one quarter by July 2024. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 70%. b) The U.S. government does not resume consideration of liquefied natural gas export projects: This condition is more complex due to various political and economic factors: - The Biden administration has paused new LNG export approvals to assess their impact on climate change, energy security, and the economy. - There's significant pressure from the oil and gas industry to resume these projects. - The upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election could influence this decision. - Global energy demands and geopolitical situations may also play a role. Given the current pause and the relatively short timeframe until July 2024, there's a decent chance that the government won't resume consideration of these projects by then.

(a) U.S. government resuming consideration of LNG export projects: The U.S. government paused approvals for new LNG export terminals in January 2024 to study their impact on climate change, energy security, and costs. This pause was significant but not permanent. Given the importance of LNG exports for U.S. energy policy and international relations, there's a moderate chance the government might resume considerations within a year. However, the timeframe is relatively short (by July 2024), which reduces the likelihood. (b) BYD's quarterly net income increasing by over 20% year-over-year: BYD is a leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer that has shown strong growth in recent years. The electric vehicle market is expanding rapidly, especially in China. BYD has been consistently improving its market share and financial performance. A 20% year-over-year increase in quarterly net income is significant but not unrealistic for a company in a high-growth sector like EVs. BYD has achieved such growth rates in the past, and the EV market continues to expand. Combining these factors: The LNG export project resumption has a moderate chance but is constrained by the short timeframe. BYD's potential for 20% net income growth seems more likely given its industry position and past performance.

(a) Union Pacific implementing a new scheduling system for passenger train services: Union Pacific is primarily a freight railroad company, with limited involvement in passenger services. Most passenger rail services in the US are operated by Amtrak or regional transit authorities. Union Pacific's focus is mainly on freight operations. Given this, it's less likely that they would implement a new scheduling system specifically for passenger train services. However, if there's increasing pressure for improved coordination with passenger services that use their tracks, there's a small possibility they might introduce such a system. Probability for (a): Low, around 0.2 (b) Union Pacific not implementing a new scheduling system for train engineers in Texas: Union Pacific has a significant presence in Texas, and the state is crucial for their freight operations. Given the ongoing challenges in the railroad industry regarding worker schedules and quality of life issues, it's more likely that Union Pacific would implement new scheduling systems to address these concerns. However, they might choose to implement such changes across their entire network rather than focusing on a single state. The probability of them not implementing a new system specifically for Texas is moderate. Probability for (b): Moderate, around 0.6 For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met.

(a) FTC investigation completion: The FTC has been increasingly active in investigating tech companies and their practices, including pricing practices. However, major investigations often take considerable time to complete, sometimes years. Given that we're looking at a timeline until July 2024 (about a year from now), it's possible but not certain that such a major investigation would be completed and announced by then. The requirement for it to involve at least five major companies adds complexity and potentially extends the timeline. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring by July 2024 at around 60%. (b) Georgia abortion rights referendum: Georgia is a traditionally conservative state that has recently passed restrictive abortion laws. While there's growing national debate on abortion rights, especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, there's no current indication that Georgia is planning to hold a referendum on enshrining abortion rights. Conservative control of the state government makes it unlikely that they would initiate such a referendum. However, grassroots movements could potentially push for one. Given the political climate in Georgia and the lack of current momentum for such a referendum, I'd estimate the probability of Georgia not holding an abortion rights referendum by August 2024 at about 85%.

There's no current indication that the state government is planning to hold a referendum to enshrine abortion rights. Such a move would be a significant shift in the state's political stance.

The FTC has been increasingly focused on consumer protection in the digital age, including issues related to data privacy and algorithmic pricing. In recent years, there has been growing concern about companies using personal data for price discrimination. The FTC has shown interest in investigating such practices. However, major investigations involving multiple large companies can be time-consuming and complex.

The House of Lords has a history of challenging government policies, especially on controversial issues.

Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut announcement by August 2024, which is more than a year away from the current date. This provides a significant time window for economic conditions to change and for the BoE to adjust its policy stance. Historical precedent: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates immediately after a tightening cycle. They often maintain higher rates for a period to ensure inflation is under control before considering cuts. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The extended time frame increases the likelihood, as it allows for potential improvements in inflation and economic conditions. However, the BoE will likely be cautious about cutting rates too soon after a tightening cycle, especially if inflation remains above target.

Let's estimate this probability at around 60%. b) Bank of England not announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: The Bank of England's interest rate decisions are influenced by various economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic conditions. As of now (June 2023), the Bank of England has been raising interest rates to combat high inflation. For them to consider cutting rates by August 2024, there would need to be a significant change in economic conditions, such as a sharp economic downturn or a rapid decline in inflation. While economic predictions over a year into the future are inherently uncertain, the likelihood of no rate cut by August 2024 seems moderately high, perhaps around 70%.

As of now (June 2023), the BoE's base rate is at 4.5%. While inflation has been showing signs of easing, it's still above the target of 2%. The BoE typically doesn't cut rates until inflation is under control and economic growth needs stimulation. Given the current economic climate and inflation trends, it's possible that by mid-2024, inflation could be sufficiently under control for the BoE to consider a rate cut.

(b) GNC Holdings emerging from bankruptcy by July 31, 2024: GNC Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2020 and has been working on restructuring since then. The company has already made significant progress in its reorganization efforts, including closing underperforming stores and focusing on its core business. Typically, Chapter 11 bankruptcies can take anywhere from several months to a few years to resolve. Given that GNC filed for bankruptcy in 2020, it's reasonable to expect that they could emerge from bankruptcy by July 2024, which would be four years after filing.

However, Spotify has been working on improving its profitability and has shown some positive financial results recently. The likelihood of additional layoffs depends on Spotify's financial performance and market conditions over the next year.

Reserve Bank of India announcing a reduction in its key interest rate: As of June 2023, the RBI has maintained a repo rate of 6.5% for some time. The Indian economy has been showing signs of growth, and inflation has been a concern. Central banks typically reduce interest rates to stimulate economic growth during slowdowns or recessions. While India's economy is growing, there are global economic uncertainties that could impact it.

However, given the current economic conditions and the RBI's focus on controlling inflation, a rate cut seems less likely in the near term.

(a) Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure exceeding 0.5% monthly increase: The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), has been relatively stable in recent months. As of the latest data, monthly increases have been well below 0.5%. For this condition to be met, we would need to see a significant spike in inflation. While not impossible, such a large monthly increase is relatively rare and would likely require a major economic shock or policy change. The probability of this occurring in any single month between now and July 2024 is low, but not negligible. Let's estimate this at around 15-20%. (b) Italian economy entering a recession: Italy's economy has been facing challenges, including high public debt, political instability, and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country has experienced periods of economic contraction in recent years. However, recent forecasts from organizations like the IMF and the European Commission suggest modest growth for Italy in the near term. That said, the Italian economy remains vulnerable to external shocks and internal political issues. The probability of Italy entering a recession by July 2024 is higher than average but still not a certainty. Let's estimate this at around 30-35%. For both conditions to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities. Even if we take the higher estimates for both (20% for inflation spike and 35% for Italian recession), the combined probability would be 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07 or 7%. However, it's worth noting that these events are not entirely independent. A global economic shock that could cause a significant inflation spike in the US might also increase the likelihood of a recession in Italy. This positive correlation slightly increases the joint probability. Considering all these factors, I would estimate the probability of both events occurring by July 2024 to be slightly higher than the simple multiplication would suggest, but still quite low."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "ab979dde-5353-4b8a-8396-b69864e4de46", "title": "Will either of the following occur by July 2024: (a) The Italian economy avoids a recession, or (b) The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure shows a monthly increase exceeding 0.5%?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) The Italian economy does not enter a recession by July 31, 2024, which means it does not experience two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth as reported by the Italian National Institute of Statistics between October 1, 2023, and July 31, 2024.

However, recent data shows some resilience. The Italian economy grew by 0.6% in Q1 2023, surpassing expectations. While there are still risks, including potential energy shortages and global economic slowdown, the likelihood of Italy avoiding a recession seems moderately high. The European Central Bank's policies and potential EU support also factor into this assessment. b) Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure showing a monthly increase exceeding 0.5%: The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, has been showing signs of cooling in recent months. However, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. While the trend is downward, there's still a possibility of unexpected spikes due to factors such as energy prices, supply chain disruptions, or unforeseen economic shocks. It's important to note that a single month exceeding 0.5% would satisfy this condition, and we're looking at a period of about 10 months. Combining these factors: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs, which increases the overall probability. The timeframe (until July 2024) is relatively long, providing more opportunity for either event to happen. The Italian economy seems more likely to avoid a recession than to enter one, while the inflation measure has a lower but still significant chance of exceeding 0.5% in a single month over this period.

Let's analyze each part separately: a) France appointing a new President by August 2024: The current President of France is Emmanuel Macron, who was re-elected in 2022 for a five-year term. His term is set to end in 2027. Barring any unforeseen circumstances such as resignation, impeachment, or death in office, it is highly unlikely that France will appoint a new President by August 2024. The French political system is stable, and there are no indications of a potential change in presidency within this timeframe. b) Bank of England's base rate remaining at or above 5.00% in August 2024: As of October 2023, the Bank of England's base rate is at 5.25%. The bank has been raising interest rates to combat inflation. While it's difficult to predict future economic conditions with certainty, there are several factors to consider: 1. Current inflation rates are high, and the Bank of England is committed to bringing inflation down to its 2% target. 2. Economic forecasts suggest that interest rates might remain elevated for an extended period to control inflation. 3. However, there's also a possibility that economic conditions might change, potentially leading to rate cuts if inflation is brought under control or if there's an economic downturn. Given these factors, there's a significant chance that the base rate will remain at or above 5.00% in August 2024, although it's not certain. Considering both events, the probability of at least one occurring is primarily driven by the likelihood of the Bank of England's base rate remaining at or above 5.00%. While the appointment of a new French President is highly unlikely, the interest rate scenario is more probable.

Market pressure: There's increasing global pressure on pharmaceutical companies to make life-saving drugs more accessible, especially in developing countries. However, companies are often reluctant to give up patent rights prematurely due to the significant investment in research and development. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is only about a month from the question's creation date. This very short timeframe makes it less likely for Astellas to make such a significant decision, unless it was already in the works. 4.

Let's analyze each part separately: 1. Mexican authorities declaring the dismantling of La Familia Michoacana by July 2024: La Familia Michoacana is a well-established drug cartel that has been operating for many years. While Mexican authorities have had some success in targeting drug cartels, completely dismantling a major cartel within a year is a significant challenge. Drug cartels are known for their resilience and ability to adapt to law enforcement efforts. Moreover, official declarations of a cartel's dismantling are relatively rare, as authorities are often cautious about making such definitive statements. The timeframe (by July 2024) is also relatively short for such a major accomplishment. Therefore, the probability of this condition being met is quite low. 2. FDA rejecting or delaying approval of MDMA for PTSD treatment beyond August 2024: MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD has shown promising results in clinical trials, and there has been growing support for its potential therapeutic use. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, which typically expedites the review process. Several Phase 3 clinical trials have been completed or are nearing completion. Given the current trajectory and the increasing recognition of the need for innovative PTSD treatments, it seems more likely that the FDA would approve MDMA for PTSD treatment by August 2024 rather than reject or delay it. However, the regulatory process can be unpredictable, and there's always a possibility of unexpected delays or concerns arising during the review process.

FDA approval of MDMA for PTSD therapy by August 2024: MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD has shown promising results in clinical trials. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has been at the forefront of this research and has been working towards FDA approval. In May 2021, MAPS announced positive results from its second Phase 3 trial of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. The FDA has also granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to MDMA for PTSD, which can expedite the review process. However, the FDA approval process is rigorous and can be unpredictable. While the research is promising, there's no guarantee that approval will come by August 2024. The timeline seems tight, but not impossible.

While Mexican authorities have had some successes in targeting cartel leadership, completely dismantling such organizations has proven challenging. The timeframe given (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a significant achievement. Moreover, even if substantial progress is made against the cartel, authorities might be hesitant to declare it fully dismantled unless they are absolutely certain. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 20%.

As of now, without specific information about Israel's current economic state or future projections, it's difficult to predict whether they would need to cut interest rates. Generally, central banks are cautious about frequent rate changes, and a month is a short time for significant economic shifts warranting a rate cut.

The Bank of Israel has been raising rates to combat inflation. However, by July 2024, more than a year from now, the economic landscape could change significantly.

There have already been protests and strikes related to healthcare funding and working conditions. The UK government faces ongoing pressure to increase healthcare funding, and any attempts to cut funding would likely be met with strong opposition.

Condition (a) - Nevada's minimum wage for fast food workers: As of now (June 2024), Nevada's minimum wage for fast food workers is $11 per hour. The question asks if this will remain the same through July 2024, which is only one month away from the current date. Given the short timeframe, it's unlikely that there would be a sudden change in minimum wage policy. Minimum wage changes are typically announced well in advance and often implemented at the beginning of a new year or fiscal year. Therefore, the probability of this condition being met is quite high, perhaps around 0.95. Condition (b) - 15-year mortgage rate not exceeding 5.5% by August 2024: This condition is more challenging to predict due to the volatility of interest rates and the longer time frame (about two months from now). As of June 2024, let's assume the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is around 5% (this is a hypothetical assumption as we don't have the exact current rate).

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy: If the Fed continues to fight inflation, they might keep interest rates high or even increase them. 2. Economic indicators: Inflation rates, employment data, and GDP growth can influence mortgage rates. 3. Global economic factors: International events and economic conditions can impact U.S. interest rates. Given these factors and the relatively small buffer between our assumed current rate (5%) and the threshold (5.5%), there's a significant chance that rates could exceed 5.5% by August 2024.

(a) Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure: The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), has been relatively stable in recent years. However, economic conditions can change rapidly. A monthly increase exceeding 0.5% is quite significant and would indicate a substantial uptick in inflation. While such increases are not common, they are not unprecedented, especially in times of economic volatility. Given the current economic climate, with ongoing concerns about inflation and potential economic instability, there's a moderate chance of seeing a spike in inflation that could result in a monthly PCE increase of over 0.5%. However, the Federal Reserve and other economic policymakers are actively working to control inflation, which reduces the likelihood of such a significant monthly increase. I would estimate the probability of part (a) occurring at around 30%. (b) No court ruling on hotel chain operator liability: Major hotel chains face various legal challenges regularly, but not all of these result in court rulings on liability. Many cases are settled out of court or dismissed before reaching a verdict. However, the timeframe given (by August 2024) is quite long, increasing the chances that at least one case involving a major hotel chain operator's liability would reach a court ruling. Given the frequency of legal issues in the hospitality industry and the extended timeframe, I would estimate the probability of no court ruling occurring (i.e., part (b) being true) at around 40%. Combining probabilities: For both (a) and (b) to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities: 0.30 * 0.40 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, the timeline for legal proceedings can be unpredictable. Many cases are settled out of court to avoid negative publicity and potentially larger payouts. The window for this to occur (from now until August 2024) is relatively short for a major court case to be initiated, proceed through the legal system, and reach a ruling. While it's possible, it's not highly probable given the typical length of legal proceedings. b) Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure showing a monthly increase exceeding 0.5% by July 2024: This is the more likely of the two scenarios to occur. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure. A monthly increase exceeding 0.5% is significant but not unprecedented, especially in times of economic volatility or recovery. As of my last update, inflation had been a concern, with the Federal Reserve implementing measures to control it. While these measures have had some effect, economic conditions can change rapidly due to various factors such as global events, supply chain issues, or shifts in monetary policy. The time frame for this part (October 2023 to July 2024) is quite long, providing multiple opportunities for such a spike to occur. Even if inflation is generally under control, a single month of higher inflation due to temporary factors (like energy price spikes or supply chain disruptions) could trigger this condition. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance of at least one of these conditions being met, with the inflation measure being the more likely of the two."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.026359488493328698, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0087864961644429, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.24019223070763077, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, this would require a significant shift in economic conditions. 3. Global economic trends: Global economic slowdown or recession could influence the RBA's decision to cut rates to stimulate the economy. 4. Historical context: Central banks typically don't reverse course quickly. The time between the last rate hike and the first rate cut is usually measured in years, not months. 5. RBA's forward guidance: The RBA's recent statements have been hawkish, indicating a bias towards maintaining higher rates to combat inflation. 6.

This provides some time for economic conditions to change, but it's a relatively short period for a complete reversal in monetary policy. 7. Housing market: Australia's housing market is sensitive to interest rates. If there's a significant downturn, it could pressure the RBA to cut rates. 8. Labor market: If unemployment rises significantly, it could prompt rate cuts. However, the labor market has been robust recently. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the RBA will cut rates by July 2024. The main scenario where this could happen would be a rapid decline in inflation coupled with a significant economic slowdown.

The Supreme Court struck down President Biden's broad student loan forgiveness plan in 2023. However, the administration has been exploring alternative ways to provide relief to borrowers. Given the ongoing efforts and the political pressure to address student loan issues, it's plausible that the Education Department might implement a more targeted plan for payment holidays. However, the timeframe is relatively short (about a month from the question's creation date to the resolution date), which makes it less likely for a new plan to be fully implemented.

Reserve Bank of Australia not announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024: As of June 2024, the RBA has been maintaining a relatively high interest rate to combat inflation. The global economic situation and domestic factors in Australia will influence this decision. While there's always a possibility of economic conditions changing rapidly, central banks typically move cautiously. Given the short timeframe and the general trend of central banks being cautious about rate cuts until inflation is firmly under control, it's more likely that the RBA will not announce a rate cut by July 2024.

The SEIU usually makes its endorsements well before the election, often during the primary season or early in the general election campaign.

As of now, Washington state does not have a comprehensive free community college plan in place. The timeline to implement such a program (by July 2024) is relatively short for a major policy change.

However, there are expectations that the bank might consider rate cuts in the future as inflation pressures ease. The timeframe until August 2024 is quite long, which increases the likelihood of a rate cut. However, the condition specifically requires the absence of a rate cut announcement, which could occur if economic conditions remain stable or if inflationary pressures persist. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of the Bank of Korea not announcing a rate cut by August 2024 at around 30%. To resolve YES, both conditions must be met. We calculate the joint probability by multiplying the individual probabilities: 0.40 * 0.30 = 0.12 or 12%. This calculation assumes the events are independent, which may not be entirely accurate as global economic conditions can affect both the U.S. job market and South Korean monetary policy.

As of June 2023, the BOK's base rate is at 3.50%. Given the current global economic uncertainties and the need to balance inflation control with economic growth, there's a possibility that the BOK might consider a rate cut by August 2024.

The probability of this occurring is moderate, perhaps around 40%. b) U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 275,000 for two consecutive weeks by August 2024: As of June 2023, U.S. weekly jobless claims have been hovering around 220,000-240,000. For this condition to be met, there would need to be a significant deterioration in the U.S. job market. While the U.S. economy has shown resilience, there are concerns about a potential recession due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation. If a recession does occur, it could lead to increased unemployment. However, even in a mild recession, reaching 275,000+ claims for two consecutive weeks is not guaranteed.

However, there have been increasing tensions in recent years over various issues including workplace conditions, ethical concerns, and compensation. The tech industry has seen a rise in labor activism, and Google is not immune to this trend. While a major strike is possible, it's not highly likely given Google's resources and ability to address issues before they escalate to a large-scale strike.

(a) UFCW endorsement: The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) is a large and influential labor union in the United States. Historically, labor unions often endorse presidential candidates, typically favoring Democratic nominees. However, the timing is crucial here. The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is before the typical timeframe for major union endorsements in a presidential election cycle. Usually, unions wait until after the primary season to make their endorsements, which often occurs closer to the party conventions or even later. The Democratic National Convention is typically held in July or August of the election year, which would be right around or after our resolution date. Given this timing, it's less likely that the UFCW would make an endorsement before July 31, 2024. However, it's not impossible, especially if there's a clear frontrunner in the Democratic primary or if the union feels strongly about making an early statement. (b) Google workers' strike resolution: For this part to resolve YES, several specific conditions must be met: a strike involving at least 1,000 Google workers, lasting at least a week, and being resolved by July 31, 2024. Google has faced labor disputes in recent years, including walkouts and protests. However, a major strike meeting all the specified criteria is relatively rare for the company. Google's workforce is largely non-unionized, which makes organizing such a large-scale, prolonged strike more challenging. That said, there have been increasing efforts to unionize within big tech companies, including Google. The AI boom and related ethical concerns could potentially spark labor disputes. If a strike were to occur, Google would likely try to resolve it quickly to minimize disruption and negative publicity. Combining these factors: The UFCW endorsement seems unlikely before the resolution date due to typical endorsement timing, but it's not impossible. The Google strike scenario is also relatively unlikely given the company's history and the specific criteria required, but again, not impossible given the current tech industry climate.

Reserve Bank of India imposing new regulatory curbs on Yes Bank's lending by August 2024: Yes Bank has had a history of financial troubles and regulatory interventions. In 2020, the RBI had to step in with a rescue plan due to the bank's deteriorating financial position. Since then, the bank has been working on improving its financial health. However, the banking sector in India remains under scrutiny, especially after recent issues with other banks like Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank.

Georgia: Georgia is a more conservative state that has recently passed restrictive abortion laws, including a 'heartbeat bill' in 2019. 2. Legislative processes: Both states would require significant legislative action to initiate a referendum on abortion rights. This typically involves passing bills through the state legislature and getting approval from the governor. 3. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of August 2024, which is about 14 months from now. This is a relatively short time frame for organizing a statewide referendum, especially considering the legislative processes involved. 4. Political motivation: New York: Given that abortion rights are already protected in New York, there might be less urgency to hold a referendum. However, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, there could be motivation to further solidify these rights. Georgia: The political climate in Georgia makes it less likely for a pro-abortion rights referendum to be initiated. However, changing demographics and political shifts could potentially influence this. 5. Historical precedent: Neither state has a recent history of holding referendums specifically on abortion rights. 6. Current events and public opinion: The overturning of Roe v. Wade has brought abortion rights to the forefront of political discourse, which could potentially motivate action in either state. Considering these factors, it seems more likely that if a referendum were to occur, it would be in New York rather than Georgia. However, even in New York, the likelihood is not high given the short time frame and the fact that abortion rights are already protected in the state.

The next round of negotiations is expected to cover more drugs, and diabetes medications are likely to be high on the priority list given their widespread use and high costs. However, the timeline for this question (by August 31, 2024) seems quite tight for including additional drugs in the negotiation process and having the prices confirmed to take effect. While it's possible that the process could be accelerated, it seems less likely given the complexities involved in drug price negotiations.

Current economic conditions: As of mid-2023, Mexico's inflation rate has been above the central bank's target, which has led to a series of interest rate hikes. The current interest rate is at a record high of 11.25% (as of June 2023). 2. Inflation trends: If inflation shows signs of declining and approaching the bank's target of 3% (plus or minus 1 percentage point), it could pave the way for rate cuts. 3. Global economic conditions: The global economic outlook, particularly in major economies like the US, can influence Mexico's monetary policy decisions. 4. Time frame: The question allows for over a year (from June 2023 to August 2024) for economic conditions to change and for the central bank to adjust its policy. 5. Historical precedent: Central banks typically move cautiously, especially when transitioning from a tightening cycle to an easing cycle. 6. Forward guidance: Any signals or statements from the Central Bank of Mexico about future policy direction would be crucial. Given these factors, there are arguments both for and against a rate cut by August 2024: For a rate cut: - The current high interest rate is likely unsustainable in the long term and could hamper economic growth. - There's a significant time window for economic conditions to improve and inflation to moderate. - Global inflationary pressures may ease by 2024, allowing for more accommodative policies. Against a rate cut: - Inflation has been persistent, and the bank may want to ensure it's firmly under control before cutting rates. - Global economic uncertainties may lead to a cautious approach. - The bank might prefer a gradual approach, potentially starting rate cuts later than August 2024. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024.

Fisker receiving over $500 million in grants for EV initiatives by July 2024: Fisker is an emerging player in the EV market, but several factors make this scenario less likely: - The US government has been supportive of EV initiatives, but $500 million is a substantial amount for a single company. - Fisker is not as established as other EV manufacturers like Tesla or traditional automakers entering the EV market. - The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a large grant to be approved and announced. - Competition for EV grants is intense among numerous automakers.

Given the current political climate and the conservative majority in Alabama's legislature, it's quite possible they will attempt to pass new regulations on abortion providers.

The lawsuit was filed relatively recently (in April 2023), and complex cases can take years to resolve. However, the given timeframe (about 14 months from now) is not insignificant. There's a possibility of an early dismissal or settlement, especially if the court finds clear precedents or if one side has a particularly strong case.

If rates remain high or increase further, it could make this outcome less likely. - There's potential for interest rates to decrease if inflation is brought under control, which could stimulate home sales. - The seasonal nature of the housing market means there's a higher chance of seeing increases during spring and summer months, which fall within our time frame. - Economic forecasts for 2024 are mixed, with some predicting a potential recession and others expecting moderate growth. A recession would make this outcome less likely, while growth could support it. - The requirement for seasonally adjusted data helps mitigate the impact of normal seasonal fluctuations, making the consecutive increase requirement more meaningful. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of seeing three consecutive months of increase in previously occupied home sales by July 2024. The extended time frame and potential for economic improvements work in favor of this outcome, but the current challenging market conditions and the specific requirement for three consecutive months of increase make it far from certain."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "bc0505ee-eff8-44f4-8eb0-0b24de9e3305", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Medicare's negotiated drug prices include a major cholesterol medication by August 2024, and (b) U.S. previously occupied home sales fail to increase for three consecutive months by July 2024?", "body": "(a) This part resolves as YES if the newly negotiated drug prices for Medicare include a major cholesterol medication confirmed to take effect by August 31, 2024.

Politicians, especially those in high-profile positions, rarely retract statements outright, as it can be seen as a sign of weakness or indecisiveness. However, they might clarify or modify their statements if faced with significant backlash or new information. Given that we have over a year until the deadline (August 31, 2024), there's a possibility that circumstances could change, leading to a retraction. However, without knowing the specific statement in question or any current controversy surrounding it, the likelihood of a full retraction seems low. I would estimate this probability at around 15%. b) Minnesota not holding a referendum on housing affordability: Housing affordability is a significant issue in many states, including Minnesota. However, holding a state-wide referendum is a major undertaking that requires substantial planning, resources, and political will. Given that we're looking at a timeframe ending July 31, 2024, which is just over a year away, if such a referendum were planned, it would likely already be in the works and publicly known. The fact that the question doesn't mention any current plans for such a referendum suggests that one is not currently scheduled. While it's possible that a referendum could be organized quickly if a pressing need arose, the probability of no referendum being held seems relatively high. I would estimate this probability at around 80%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12 or 12%.

Housing affordability is a significant issue, but state-wide referendums are not common occurrences, especially on such short notice. As of now, there's no widely reported plan or movement for such a referendum in Minnesota. The timeframe (by July 2024) is also quite tight, considering the question was created on June 30, 2024, leaving only a month for such a significant event to be organized and executed. The probability of this part occurring is very low, perhaps around 5%. 2. Tim Scott retracting his statement about Biden's stance on criminal justice reform by August 2024: This part is more likely to occur, but still not highly probable. Politicians do occasionally retract or modify statements, especially during election seasons when their words are under intense scrutiny. However, significant retractions are relatively rare unless there's substantial pressure or new information that emerges. Without knowing the specific statement in question or the current political climate, it's difficult to assess accurately. Given that Scott is a prominent politician and the statement relates to a contentious issue like criminal justice reform, there's a chance he might clarify or modify his stance, but a full retraction seems less likely.

Complexity: Drone delivery projects are technologically complex and require significant planning, regulatory approvals, and infrastructure development. This complexity increases the likelihood of delays. 3. Regulatory hurdles: Drone delivery services face numerous regulatory challenges, including FAA approvals and local regulations. These processes can be time-consuming and unpredictable. 4. Tribal involvement: The project is being undertaken by the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas. While tribal sovereignty might provide some advantages in terms of land use and local regulations, it's unclear if the tribe has prior experience with such technologically advanced projects. 5. Lack of prior information: The question doesn't provide any information about the current status of the project, its funding, or any progress made so far. This lack of information increases uncertainty. 6. Novelty: Large-scale drone delivery projects are still relatively new and not widely implemented, which could lead to unforeseen challenges and delays. 7. Economic factors: The question doesn't mention the project's funding or financial backing, which could be a critical factor in timely completion. 8. Environmental and geographical considerations: Texas's diverse geography and weather conditions might pose challenges for drone operations, potentially causing delays in implementation. Given these factors, it seems more likely that the project will face delays and challenges that could push completion beyond the July 2024 deadline. The complexity of the project, potential regulatory hurdles, and the relatively short timeline all weigh against timely completion. However, we should also consider that tribal projects might move faster due to potentially streamlined approval processes on tribal lands, and that there might be strong motivation and resources behind the project that we're not aware of.

This is a specific requirement that may not have been met yet for either conductor. 3. Time frame: The question resolves by July 31, 2024, which is about a month from the question's creation date. This is a relatively short time frame for new recognitions to occur. 4. Current landscape: While both Harding and Collon were young when appointed to their positions, there might be other conductors who have taken on similar roles at even younger ages. For example, Gustavo Dudamel became the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic at age 28 in 2009. 5. Likelihood of new recognitions: Given that both conductors have been in their positions for some time, it's unlikely that new recognitions of them being the youngest would suddenly appear, especially for Harding who is now in his late 40s. 6. Potential for conflicting information: For the question to resolve as YES, Harding must be recognized as the youngest while Collon must not be. This creates a potential conflict, as Collon is actually younger than Harding. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that both conditions will be met by July 2024. The main reasons are: 1. The time frame is very short for new recognitions to occur. 2. Both conductors have been in their positions for some time, making new 'youngest' recognitions unlikely. 3. There are other conductors who have taken on similar roles at younger ages, making it difficult for either Harding or Collon to be definitively recognized as the youngest. 4.

However, that doesn't mean the virus was eradicated, only that it no longer constituted an extraordinary event. 4. Ongoing research and vaccine development: While progress has been made in understanding and combating Zika, there is no widely available vaccine as of 2024, which makes it more challenging to completely control the outbreak. 5. Geographic spread: Zika virus is primarily spread by Aedes mosquitoes, which are found in many parts of the world. The global nature of the outbreak makes it more difficult to control and declare over in a short period. 6. WHO's decision-making process: The WHO is generally cautious about declaring outbreaks over, as premature declarations can lead to reduced vigilance and potential resurgence. 7.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the WHO would declare the Zika virus outbreak over by August 2024.

(a) The Global Fund announcing new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024: The Global Fund is a major international organization that regularly makes significant funding commitments to combat AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Given their history and the ongoing global health challenges, it's quite plausible that they would announce new funding commitments exceeding $400 million within a year. However, the requirement for these to be new initiatives or significant expansions, rather than continuations of existing commitments, adds some uncertainty. The Global Fund typically announces major funding decisions at their replenishment conferences or in response to specific global health crises. While $400 million is a substantial amount, it's within the realm of their usual funding scale. The timeframe of about a year (from the question's creation date to July 2024) provides ample opportunity for such an announcement. I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 70%. (b) The World Health Organization not declaring the current Zika virus outbreak over by August 2024: This condition is more challenging to assess without current information about the status of the Zika outbreak. Zika virus outbreaks tend to be cyclical and can persist for extended periods in some regions. The WHO is generally cautious about declaring outbreaks over, often waiting for a significant period of no new cases before making such declarations. However, the question implies that there is an ongoing outbreak as of June 2024 that has prompted heightened public health responses globally. If this is the case, it suggests a significant and persistent outbreak. Given the typical duration of viral outbreaks and the WHO's caution, it's quite possible that they would not declare it over within two months (from June to August 2024). I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 60%. Combining these probabilities: For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply their individual probabilities: 0.70 * 0.60 = 0.42 or 42%.

Outbreak likelihood: Given that there's no current outbreak, it's unlikely that a new one will emerge and become severe enough to warrant a global response, and then be declared over within the given timeframe.

Funding cycles: The Global Fund operates on three-year funding cycles. The current cycle (2023-2025) has already been announced, but additional funding announcements are possible. Global health priorities: With the COVID-19 pandemic receding, there may be renewed focus on other global health issues, potentially leading to new funding initiatives.

However, they have been experimenting with sports-adjacent content like documentaries and reality shows. Given the competitive streaming landscape and the importance of sports content in attracting and retaining subscribers, there's a possibility that Netflix might pursue a major sports partnership within the next year. However, this would represent a significant shift in their current strategy, which makes it less likely. b) NFL settling the 'Sunday Ticket' antitrust case for less than $4.7 billion: The NFL's 'Sunday Ticket' antitrust case is a complex legal matter. Antitrust cases can often take years to resolve, and the NFL has significant resources to fight the case. The $4.7 billion figure is quite specific, which suggests it might be based on some insider information or analysis. However, large corporations like the NFL often prefer to settle such cases to avoid prolonged legal battles and negative publicity. The timeframe of about a year is relatively short for such a complex case to settle, but it's not impossible. Combining these factors: The Netflix partnership seems less likely in the given timeframe, but not impossible. I'd estimate this at about 20% probability. The NFL settlement is more plausible, given the general tendency for such cases to settle. However, the specific amount and timeframe make it less certain. I'd estimate this at about 30% probability.

The global economic outlook and domestic economic conditions will play a crucial role in determining the future of interest rates.

Facebook's AI content moderation system being reported for spreading election misinformation by August 31, 2024: - Facebook (now Meta) has been under intense scrutiny for its role in spreading misinformation, especially during elections. - The company has been investing heavily in AI-powered content moderation to address these issues. - However, AI systems are not perfect and can make mistakes or be manipulated. - The 2024 U.S. Presidential election will be held in November, and the lead-up to it will be during the timeframe in question. - Given the high stakes and increased attention on social media's role in elections, there's a significant chance that any issues with Facebook's AI moderation system would be quickly noticed and reported. - However, Facebook has also been improving its systems, which might reduce the likelihood of major issues. 2. Mississippi holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 31, 2024: - Abortion rights have been a contentious issue in the U.S., especially since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. - Mississippi was at the center of the Supreme Court case that led to this decision. - Several states have held referendums on abortion rights since then, with mixed results. - However, Mississippi is a conservative state that has historically been against abortion rights. - There's no current indication that Mississippi is planning such a referendum. - The timeframe (by July 31, 2024) is relatively short for organizing a statewide referendum if it's not already in the works. Considering both parts, the question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs. This increases the overall probability. However, both events still seem relatively unlikely within the given timeframe. For the Facebook AI issue, while it's possible, Facebook has strong incentives to prevent such a problem. For the Mississippi referendum, it seems unlikely given the state's political leanings and the lack of current movement towards such a vote. Probability: 0.35 The probability is set at 0.35 because while both events are possible, they both face significant obstacles. The Facebook AI issue is more likely than the Mississippi referendum, but neither seems probable enough to push the overall likelihood above 50%.

This trend suggests a high likelihood of continued scrutiny and potential new legal actions. 2. YouTube's relationship to Google: YouTube is a subsidiary of Google (Alphabet Inc.). Typically, legal actions against a parent company don't always extend to its subsidiaries, especially if they operate somewhat independently. 3. Regulatory climate: There's an increasing focus on regulating big tech companies, which could lead to more legal actions against major players like Google. 4.

This limits the window for new legal actions to be initiated and announced. 5.

This specificity makes the scenario more challenging to fulfill. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Google will face new legal actions by August 2024, given its size, influence, and history of legal challenges. However, the requirement that YouTube must avoid any new legal actions in the same period makes the overall scenario less likely. YouTube, while a significant platform, has generally faced fewer direct legal challenges from the U.S. government compared to its parent company.

Political climate: While there are often debates about government spending, NASA typically enjoys bipartisan support due to its scientific, technological, and exploratory missions. A 20% cut would be a significant departure from this trend. 3. Timeframe: The question specifies a relatively short timeframe (by August 2024), which limits the opportunity for such a significant policy shift to occur and gain enough support to pass the Senate. 4. Current NASA initiatives: NASA is currently involved in several high-profile projects, including the Artemis program to return humans to the Moon.

Climate change policy, while important, is not typically the subject of a standalone statewide referendum. There's no current indication that such a referendum is being planned.

NASA's budget has generally been stable or increasing in recent years, with bipartisan support for space exploration and research. While budget cuts are always possible, a cut of more than 20% would be drastic and unusual. Such a significant cut would likely face strong opposition from both parties.

However, these were phased out due to changing market conditions and pressure from member states. For a new 50% or higher tariff to be implemented: 1. There would need to be significant evidence of Chinese dumping or unfair subsidies. 2. EU manufacturers would need to lobby strongly for protection. 3. The EU would need to overcome potential resistance from member states concerned about higher solar panel costs impacting green energy goals. Given the current global focus on renewable energy and climate change, a high tariff could be seen as counterproductive. However, the EU's desire to protect its domestic industry and reduce dependence on Chinese imports might push for such a measure. The probability of this occurring is moderate to low.

The Bank Rate currently stands at 5%, the highest level in 15 years. 2. Inflation outlook: The Bank of England's primary mandate is to maintain price stability, targeting a 2% inflation rate. If inflation shows signs of cooling down significantly by early to mid-2024, it could pave the way for rate cuts. 3. Economic growth: The UK economy has been struggling with slow growth. If economic conditions worsen or stagnate, it might prompt the BoE to consider rate cuts to stimulate growth. 4. Global economic factors: Global economic conditions, including actions by other major central banks like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, can influence the BoE's decisions. 5. Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut announcement by August 2024, which is over a year away from the current date.

They usually wait to see the full effects of their tightening policy before reversing course. 7.

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The extended time frame increases the possibility, as it allows for potential changes in economic conditions. However, the current high inflation environment and the BoE's cautious approach suggest they may be hesitant to cut rates too quickly. If inflation shows a consistent downward trend through 2023 and early 2024, and if economic growth remains weak, the probability of a rate cut announcement would increase.

The BoE has consistently emphasized the need to ensure inflation is sustainably under control before considering rate cuts.

Let's analyze each separately: 1. Enforceable ethics code for U.S. Congress members by July 2024: The likelihood of this happening is quite low. Here's why: - Establishing an enforceable ethics code for Congress would require significant bipartisan support, which is challenging in the current polarized political climate. - Such a code would need to pass through both chambers of Congress and be signed by the President, a process that typically takes considerable time. - There's no strong indication that this is a current priority for Congress or the administration. - The deadline (July 2024) is relatively soon, leaving little time for the necessary legislative process. 2. Michigan holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: The probability of this occurring is much higher: - Michigan already held a successful referendum on abortion rights in November 2022, which enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution. - Given this recent history, it's unlikely that another referendum on the same topic would be necessary or planned so soon after. - However, if there were attempts to challenge or modify the 2022 amendment, it could potentially trigger another referendum. - The timeframe (by August 2024) allows more time for potential political developments that could lead to a referendum. Considering both scenarios, the overall probability leans towards a 'NO' resolution.

Historical performance: Mercedes-Benz has shown the ability to achieve significant growth in the past, but 20% is a substantial increase for a mature company in the automotive industry. 2. Economic conditions: The global economy is facing challenges, including inflation and potential recession fears, which could impact consumer spending on luxury vehicles. 3. Industry trends: The automotive industry is undergoing a transition towards electric vehicles (EVs), which requires significant investment and could impact short-term profitability. 4. Mercedes-Benz's EV strategy: The company has been investing heavily in EVs, which could start paying off in terms of increased sales and potentially higher margins. 5. Supply chain issues: The automotive industry has faced supply chain disruptions, particularly with semiconductor shortages.

(a) Canadian economy avoiding recession: The Canadian economy has been showing signs of resilience despite global economic challenges. As of late 2023, Canada's GDP growth has been modest but positive. The Bank of Canada has been implementing monetary policies to control inflation while supporting economic growth. However, there are still risks such as high household debt levels and potential global economic slowdowns that could impact Canada. Given the current trajectory and the relatively short timeframe (until July 2024), it seems more likely than not that Canada will avoid a recession. I would estimate the probability of avoiding a recession at about 70%. (b) Mercedes-Benz's quarterly net income not increasing by over 20% year-over-year: Mercedes-Benz, like many automakers, has been facing challenges such as supply chain issues, chip shortages, and the transition to electric vehicles.

The luxury car market is also sensitive to economic conditions, which have been uncertain. Additionally, the company has been investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving technologies, which could impact short-term profitability. Considering these factors, it seems more likely than not that Mercedes-Benz will not report a net income increase of more than 20% in any quarter.

In recent years, luxury car makers have shown resilience, but a 20% increase in net income is a significant threshold.

The target of 13.25% is not far from the current rate, making it quite plausible to be reached by August 2024. Let's estimate this probability at around 70%. For both events to occur simultaneously, we need to multiply their individual probabilities: 0.30 * 0.70 = 0.21 or 21%.

The Central Bank of Brazil has been maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation. However, there are expectations that the rate might start to decrease in the coming months as inflation shows signs of easing. The question asks about the rate in August 2024, which is more than a year from now. Given the current global economic uncertainties and Brazil's history of economic volatility, it's difficult to predict with high confidence what the rate will be by then. However, most economists expect that Brazil will be able to lower its interest rates gradually over the next year, assuming inflation continues to cool down. b) Argentine agricultural workers' strike: As of June 2023, there isn't a major ongoing strike of agricultural workers in Argentina. However, Argentina has a history of frequent labor disputes, particularly in the agricultural sector due to economic instability and policy changes. The question asks about the situation in August 2024, which is more than a year away. Given Argentina's economic challenges and history of labor unrest, it's possible that a strike could occur and potentially last until August 2024, but it's not highly probable. Considering both conditions: 1. For the Brazilian Selic rate to remain at or above 13.25% by August 2024 seems unlikely given the current trajectory, but it's not impossible if economic conditions worsen. 2. For Argentine agricultural workers to be on a strike that lasts until August 2024 is possible but not highly probable. The question resolves as YES if either of these conditions is met. While both seem unlikely individually, the fact that only one needs to occur increases the overall probability. Probability: 0.35 I estimate a 35% chance that either of these conditions will be met by August 2024. This relatively low probability reflects the expectation that Brazil will likely lower its interest rates and that while strikes in Argentina are possible, a prolonged strike lasting over a year is less likely. However, the probability is not extremely low due to the economic uncertainties in both countries and the fact that only one condition needs to be met for a YES resolution."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.13278672153357507, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04426224051119169, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5117409474728937, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Most E. coli infections are not fatal, especially with proper medical care. For an outbreak to result in more than 10 confirmed deaths would be unusually severe. According to CDC data, most E. coli outbreaks in recent years have resulted in fewer than 5 deaths, even in large-scale incidents.

Sara Lee is a major producer of packaged meats, which increases the risk of potential contamination.

The requirement for more than 10 confirmed deaths makes this scenario less likely.

This is a substantial jump, but not impossible given the right economic conditions. Factors that could contribute to such a rise include: Global economic recovery, Improved relations with North Korea, Strong performance of South Korean tech companies, Increased foreign investment.

Large-scale industrial projects like battery factories are typically planned well in advance and involve significant investments. Cancellations of such projects are rare unless there are major economic downturns, regulatory issues, or significant changes in company strategy. Without specific information about problems with this particular project, we should assume it's more likely to proceed than be canceled. Let's estimate the probability of cancellation at around 15%. b) South Korea's KOSPI index reaching or exceeding 3,500 points: As of June 2023, the KOSPI index is trading around 2,600 points. Reaching 3,500 points would require a significant increase of about 35% in just over a year. While such increases are not unheard of, they are relatively rare for mature markets. The KOSPI has never reached 3,500 points in its history, with its all-time high being around 3,300 in 2021.

Let's analyze each scenario separately: 1. Nigeria maintaining its ban on cryptocurrency transactions: Nigeria implemented a ban on cryptocurrency transactions in February 2021. As of now (June 2023), this ban is still in place. The Nigerian government has shown a consistent stance against cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about financial stability and potential use for illicit activities. While there have been some discussions about potentially regulating cryptocurrencies instead of outright banning them, no concrete steps have been taken to reverse the ban. Given the relatively short timeframe until August 2024 and the government's current position, it seems more likely than not that Nigeria will maintain its ban. 2. Russia's Federation Council passing a major economic reform bill opposed by President Putin: This scenario is less likely to occur. Russia's political system is heavily centralized, with President Putin wielding significant influence over the legislative process. The Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament, typically aligns with Putin's policies. For a major economic reform bill opposed by Putin to pass through the Federation Council would be highly unusual and would suggest a significant shift in Russia's political dynamics. Moreover, given the current geopolitical situation with Russia's involvement in Ukraine and the resulting international sanctions, it's unlikely that the Russian government would risk internal political discord over major economic reforms. Putin's administration is likely to maintain a tight control over economic policies to manage the challenges posed by sanctions and international isolation. Considering these factors, the first scenario (Nigeria maintaining its cryptocurrency ban) appears much more likely than the second scenario (Russian Federation Council passing a bill opposed by Putin). Given that only one of these scenarios needs to occur for the question to resolve as YES, and the higher probability of the first scenario, I would estimate a relatively high likelihood of this question resolving as YES."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0072255849082495105, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.002408528302749837, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.12950713031441533, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Combining these factors: - Both events are possible but not highly probable within the given timeframe. - The question resolves as YES if either event occurs, which increases the overall probability. - The abortion ban seems slightly more likely than Biden's specific NEA appearance in Pennsylvania, given recent political trends in Iowa. Given these considerations, I would estimate a moderate probability for this question resolving as YES."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.035654685621875626, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.011884895207291876, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2662925499179867, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Global economic factors: Australia's economy is influenced by global trends, particularly its trade relationships with China and other major economies. Any significant downturn in these economies could impact Australia. 4. Domestic factors: Housing market conditions, consumer spending, and business investment are key drivers of the Australian economy. These have been relatively stable but are facing pressures from rising interest rates and inflation. 5. Government policies: Fiscal policies and economic stimulus measures implemented by the Australian government can help buffer against economic downturns. 6. Historical context: Australia has a strong track record of avoiding recessions, having not experienced one for about 30 years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 7.

Recent economic data: While growth has slowed, it hasn't turned negative in recent quarters, providing a buffer against an immediate recession. Given these factors, it appears more likely than not that Australia will avoid a recession by July 2024.

However, the global economic outlook is uncertain, and Australia is not immune to international economic pressures. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could potentially slow economic growth.

The country's diverse economy, strong exports, and effective monetary policies contribute to its economic stability.

Current state of unionization: In May 2022, the Apple store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the US. The Colorado store (in Boulder) voted to unionize in January 2023. This shows a growing trend of unionization among Apple retail employees. 2. Time frame: The question's resolution date is July 31, 2024, which gives approximately 18 months from the Colorado store's unionization vote to finalize a contract. This is a reasonable amount of time for negotiations, but labor contracts can often take longer, especially for first-time agreements. 3. Apple's stance: Historically, Apple has been resistant to unionization efforts. The company has been accused of anti-union tactics in the past, which might slow down the negotiation process. 4. Precedent: As of now, Apple hasn't finalized a union contract with any of its US stores, including the Towson store which unionized earlier. This suggests that the company may be taking a cautious and potentially slow approach to these negotiations. 5. Legal and regulatory environment: The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been more pro-labor under the Biden administration, which could put pressure on Apple to negotiate in good faith and reach an agreement. 6. Public and investor pressure: As a high-profile company, Apple may face pressure from consumers and investors to resolve labor disputes and finalize contracts, which could expedite the process. 7. Complexity of negotiations: First-time contracts often take longer to negotiate as both parties need to agree on a wide range of issues, from wages and benefits to working conditions and dispute resolution procedures. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Apple will finalize a union contract with the Colorado store employees by July 2024. The growing trend of unionization and potential external pressures work in favor of an agreement.

(a) Central Bank of Chile interest rate reduction by August 2024: Chile, like many countries, has been facing inflationary pressures. As of 2023, the Central Bank of Chile had maintained a relatively high interest rate to combat inflation. However, by August 2024, more than a year from now, it's possible that inflationary pressures might have eased, allowing for a rate cut. Global economic conditions and domestic factors will play a role in this decision. Central banks typically move towards easing monetary policy when economic growth slows or inflation is under control. Given the timeframe (over a year), there's a moderate chance of a rate cut occurring. (b) Apple not finalizing a union contract with Colorado store employees by July 2024: Apple has historically been resistant to unionization efforts in its retail stores. The process of negotiating and finalizing a union contract can be lengthy, often taking months or even years. As of 2023, Apple's engagement with unions has been limited, and they have shown reluctance in some cases. However, there's increasing pressure for tech companies to engage with unions, and by July 2024, there might be more progress in this area. The specific case in Colorado adds uncertainty, as local factors could influence the negotiation process. Combining these factors: For the question to resolve as YES, both events need to occur. The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. I estimate there's about a 60% chance of a rate cut by the Central Bank of Chile by August 2024. For Apple not finalizing a union contract, I estimate about a 70% chance, given their historical resistance and the potential for prolonged negotiations.

Condition A: U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 250,000 for five consecutive weeks by August 2024. The U.S. job market has been relatively strong in recent years, with unemployment rates remaining low. However, there are several factors that could potentially lead to an increase in jobless claims: economic uncertainty and potential recession fears, ongoing inflation concerns, Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions, potential technological disruptions and automation, and global economic factors and trade tensions. While these factors exist, it's important to note that 250,000 weekly jobless claims for five consecutive weeks is a relatively high threshold. As of mid-2023, weekly jobless claims have generally been below 250,000. For this condition to be met, there would need to be a significant economic downturn or major disruption in the job market. Given the current economic conditions and the timeframe (by August 2024), I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 20-25%. Condition B: Apple finalizing a union contract with store employees in New Jersey by July 2024. Apple has been facing increasing pressure from employees seeking unionization in various locations. However, the company has shown resistance to these efforts. Factors to consider include Apple's historical stance against unionization, the company's significant resources to potentially delay or challenge unionization efforts, the relatively recent nature of unionization efforts in Apple stores, the specific focus on New Jersey, which narrows the possibility, and the requirement for not just unionization, but a finalized contract. While there is growing momentum for unionization in the tech industry, Apple's resistance and the specific requirements make this condition less likely. However, the timeframe (by July 2024) does provide some room for negotiations and potential progress. I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 15-20%.

Baidu announcing measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption by July 2024: Baidu is one of China's leading AI companies and has been investing heavily in AI development. With increasing global awareness of the environmental impact of AI, it's plausible that Baidu might announce measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption. However, there are several factors to consider: - The timeframe is relatively short (about a year from now). - There's growing pressure on tech companies to address their environmental impact. - China has set ambitious carbon neutrality goals. - Baidu has previously shown interest in green initiatives. Given these factors, I'd say there's a moderate chance (around 60%) that Baidu will make such an announcement. 2. Cruise's robotaxis not being available on Didi's ride-hailing service in China by August 2024: This is a more complex situation: - Cruise is primarily operating in the US and hasn't announced plans for China expansion. - Regulatory hurdles for foreign autonomous vehicle companies in China are significant. - Didi already has partnerships with Chinese autonomous vehicle companies. - The timeframe (about 14 months from now) is relatively short for international expansion and regulatory approval.

This suggests a more progressive stance on LGBTQ+ issues. 2. Recent trends: There has been a growing national debate on transgender rights and medical care for transgender youth. Some states have enacted restrictive laws, while others have moved to protect access to care. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is about 13 months from now. This is a relatively short period for passing significant legislation, especially on a controversial topic. 4. Existing restrictions: The question implies that there are current restrictions on medical care for transgender youth in Michigan. However, as of my last update, Michigan did not have particularly restrictive laws in this area compared to some other states. 5. Public opinion: Michigan is generally considered a swing state, with a mix of liberal and conservative views. Public opinion on transgender issues could influence legislative action. 6. Legislative priorities: The state legislature may have other pressing issues to address, which could delay or prevent action on this specific topic. 7. Potential opposition: Even with Democratic control, there might be moderate Democrats or strong Republican opposition that could slow down or block such legislation. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of Michigan enacting such a law by July 2024.

However, the process is set to begin earlier. The first 10 drugs selected for negotiation are to be announced by September 1, 2023, with prices to be implemented in 2026. Given this timeline, it's highly likely that Medicare will engage in negotiations with pharmaceutical companies well before August 2024. The process is mandated by law, and there's significant political pressure to address drug prices. Therefore, this part of the question is very likely to occur. (b) Michigan not enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024: As of 2023, Michigan does not have specific state laws restricting gender-affirming care for transgender youth. In fact, Michigan has been moving in a more progressive direction regarding LGBTQ+ rights. In March 2023, Michigan expanded its civil rights law to protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Given this trend and the current political climate in Michigan (with Democrats controlling both legislative chambers and the governorship), it seems unlikely that Michigan would enact new restrictions on medical care for transgender youth. However, the absence of action (not enacting a new law) is generally more likely than the enactment of a specific law, especially in a relatively short timeframe. Combining these probabilities: For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. The first condition (Medicare negotiations) is very likely, while the second condition (Michigan not enacting new restrictions) is also fairly likely.

(a) Michigan enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024: Currently, Michigan does not have specific state-level restrictions on gender-affirming care for transgender youth. However, the political climate around transgender rights is volatile across the United States. Given that Michigan has a Democratic governor and a Democratic-controlled legislature as of 2023, it's less likely that they would enact new restrictions. Conversely, they might consider passing laws to protect access to such care. However, given the short timeframe (about a year) and the fact that this isn't currently a pressing issue in Michigan, the probability of new legislation by July 2024 seems relatively low. I'd estimate this at about 20%. (b) Medicare negotiating drug prices with a major pharmaceutical company by August 2024: This is much more likely to occur. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022, allows Medicare to negotiate prices for certain high-cost prescription drugs. The law specifies that the first round of price negotiations will begin in 2023, with new prices taking effect in 2026. However, the process of negotiation is expected to start well before 2026. The Department of Health and Human Services has already published a list of the first 10 drugs selected for negotiation in August 2023. Given this timeline and the political will behind this initiative, it's highly likely that Medicare will engage in negotiations with major pharmaceutical companies well before August 2024.

The question is whether it will remain at or above this level in August 2024, which is more than a year from now. Several factors need to be considered: 1. Global economic trends: The world economy is facing uncertainties due to various factors including inflation, geopolitical tensions, and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. 2. South Korea's economic situation: The country's economic growth, inflation rate, and export performance will influence the central bank's decision. 3. Current monetary policy stance: The Bank of Korea has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation. 4. Future economic projections: Forecasts for 2024 will play a crucial role in determining the interest rate path. Given the current high interest rate environment globally and the tendency of central banks to move rates gradually, there's a moderate chance that the rate will remain at or above 3.50% in August 2024. However, if global economic conditions improve significantly or inflation pressures ease, there could be room for rate cuts. (b) Sony's AI workforce announcement: Several factors support the likelihood of Sony announcing an increase in its AI-related workforce: 1. Growing importance of AI: AI is becoming increasingly crucial in various industries, including those where Sony operates (electronics, gaming, entertainment). 2. Competition: Other tech giants are heavily investing in AI, which may prompt Sony to bolster its own AI capabilities. 3. Sony's history: The company has shown interest in AI development in recent years. 4. Timeframe: The relatively long period until July 2024 gives Sony ample time to develop and announce such plans. However, we should also consider that Sony might choose to focus on other areas or may already have sufficient AI staff.

Global economic trends: The global economic outlook plays a role in Indonesia's monetary policy decisions. If major economies like the US or China show signs of slowing down, it might influence Indonesia to consider rate cuts to stimulate growth. 3. Historical behavior: The Central Bank of Indonesia has been known for its cautious approach to monetary policy. They tend to prioritize stability and are not quick to make rate changes unless absolutely necessary. 4. Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut announcement by August 2024, which is about 14 months from the question's creation date.

This is not particularly high by historical standards, which means there might not be strong pressure to cut rates unless economic conditions deteriorate. 6. Inflation targets: The Central Bank's primary mandate is to maintain price stability. If inflation remains within the target range, there may be less incentive to cut rates. 7. External factors: Geopolitical events, global commodity prices, and exchange rate pressures can influence the decision to cut rates. Given these factors, I believe that while a rate cut is possible, it's not highly probable. The Central Bank of Indonesia is likely to maintain a cautious stance unless there's a significant economic downturn or external shock.

As of 2023, Bank Indonesia has been maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy to control inflation and support the rupiah. However, by August 2024, there's a possibility that global economic conditions might change, potentially allowing for monetary easing.

(b) Volvo receiving over $500 million in grants for electric vehicle initiatives by July 2024: The US government has been increasingly supportive of electric vehicle initiatives as part of its climate change and industrial policies. $500 million is a significant amount, even for large-scale EV projects. Volvo has been actively pursuing electrification of its vehicle lineup. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a large grant to be processed and awarded. Competition for such grants is likely to be fierce among various automakers. Combining these factors: The likelihood of (a) occurring seems moderate.

The state has not shown a strong history of holding referendums on environmental policies. Additionally, with only about a month left until the resolution date, there have been no indications or news about such a referendum being planned. The short timeframe makes it highly unlikely for a statewide referendum to be organized, announced, and conducted by July 31, 2024. Therefore, the probability of this part occurring is very low. 2. Central Bank of Brazil announcing an interest rate cut: The Central Bank of Brazil has been maintaining a relatively high interest rate (Selic rate) to combat inflation.

Factors to consider: a) Brazil's inflation rate has been decreasing in recent months. b) There's growing pressure to stimulate economic growth. c) Global economic trends might influence Brazil's monetary policy.

Currently, there's no strong indication that a referendum on abortion rights is being planned. The state already has strong protections for abortion rights, which might reduce the perceived urgency for such a referendum. However, given the national focus on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v.

Still, organizing a statewide referendum is a significant undertaking that typically requires substantial lead time, and there's no public discussion of such plans at present. I would estimate the probability of this occurring by July 2024 to be relatively low, around 15%.

The state has already passed significant abortion restrictions in recent years, including a near-total ban in 2022 that was later blocked by courts. Given this context, it's quite plausible that Indiana would attempt to enact further restrictions on abortion providers. The Republican majority in the state government increases the likelihood of such legislation being proposed and passed. However, the question specifies that the new regulations must be stricter for abortion providers compared to other healthcare providers, which narrows the scope somewhat.

Given the rapid advancements and increasing competition in the AI field, it's highly likely that Microsoft will continue to expand its AI capabilities. The timeframe (by July 2024) gives Microsoft over a year to make such an announcement, which is a considerable amount of time in the fast-moving tech industry. Additionally, as AI becomes more integral to various industries, the demand for AI talent is likely to increase. Microsoft, being a leader in the field, would want to secure top talent to maintain its competitive edge. (b) CMA announcing completion of a major digital advertising practices investigation: The CMA has been increasingly active in investigating digital markets and advertising practices.

(a) Median Canadian home price reaching a new record high by July 2024: The Canadian housing market has been known for its resilience and long-term growth trend. However, it has faced challenges recently due to rising interest rates and economic uncertainties. As of 2023, the market has shown signs of cooling. For prices to reach a new record high by July 2024, we would need to see a significant market rebound. Factors that could contribute to price increases include potential interest rate cuts if inflation is brought under control, continued housing supply shortages in major urban areas, and ongoing immigration driving housing demand. Conversely, prolonged high interest rates, economic slowdown or recession, and government interventions to cool the market could prevent new record highs. Given the current market conditions and the relatively short timeframe (about a year), reaching a new record high seems challenging but not impossible. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. (b) New York City not announcing plans to restrict short-term rental units: New York City has already implemented strict regulations on short-term rentals, particularly targeting platforms like Airbnb. The city has been actively enforcing these rules and has shown a consistent stance against unrestricted short-term rentals. Factors that suggest NYC might not announce new restrictions include existing regulations being quite strict, potential pushback from the tourism industry and property owners, and a focus on other pressing urban issues. However, ongoing concerns about housing affordability and availability for residents, pressure from the hotel industry, and continued issues with illegal short-term rentals suggest they might announce new restrictions. Given NYC's history and current stance, it seems more likely that they will maintain the status quo or potentially even announce new restrictions rather than not doing so. I'd estimate the probability of NYC not announcing new restrictions at about 60%. Combining probabilities for both conditions to be met, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.40 * 0.60 = 0.24 or 24%.

Given this recent action, it's less likely that NYC will announce new major restrictions within the next year. However, cities often continue to refine and adjust their policies, so some minor changes or enforcement announcements are possible. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring by July 2024 at about 30%. b) Canadian median home price reaching a new record high: The Canadian housing market has been volatile in recent years, with prices reaching record highs in 2022 before cooling off due to rising interest rates. As of early 2023, prices have been showing signs of stabilization and even slight increases in some areas. Factors to consider: - Interest rates are expected to stabilize or potentially decrease in the coming year, which could stimulate the housing market. - There's ongoing housing supply shortage in many Canadian cities. - Immigration to Canada remains strong, creating housing demand. - The Canadian economy is generally stable, which supports housing prices.

In December 2023, a Wisconsin judge ruled that the 1849 law doesn't apply to consensual abortions, effectively allowing abortions to continue in the state. This ruling is likely to be appealed, and the case could potentially reach the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

(a) U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 300,000 for three consecutive weeks: As of June 2023, U.S. weekly jobless claims have been consistently below 300,000, often around 200,000-250,000. However, the economic situation can change rapidly. Factors that could lead to increased jobless claims include: 1. A potential recession, which some economists predict for late 2023 or 2024. 2. Ongoing inflation and interest rate hikes, which could lead to job cuts. 3. Technological disruptions like AI advancements potentially displacing workers. Given these factors, there's a moderate chance of jobless claims exceeding 300,000 for three consecutive weeks by August 2024. However, the U.S. job market has shown resilience, and the government may implement policies to prevent such a scenario. (b) US airline mechanics remaining on strike: As of June 2023, there is no major ongoing strike of airline mechanics in the U.S. However, labor tensions in the airline industry have been high due to: 1. Post-pandemic recovery leading to increased workloads. 2. Inflation pressures on wages. 3. Historical precedent for strikes in the industry. While a strike could occur, it's less likely that it would persist until August 2024 without resolution, given the economic importance of air travel and potential government intervention. Combining these factors: - The probability of condition (a) occurring is moderate, perhaps around 30-40%. - The probability of condition (b) occurring and persisting until August 2024 is lower, perhaps 10-15%. Since only one condition needs to be met for a YES resolution, we need to calculate the probability of at least one occurring. Using the higher estimates and the formula for the probability of at least one event occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.40 + 0.15 - (0.40 * 0.15) = 0.49.

This typically reduces the need for monetary stimulus through rate cuts. 2. Inflation trends: The RBI's primary mandate is to maintain price stability. Recent data shows that inflation in India has been moderating but still remains above the RBI's target range. This suggests that the RBI might be cautious about cutting rates too soon. 3. Global economic environment: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, influence the RBI's decisions.

However, they can make adjustments outside these periods if economic conditions warrant it. Given that the timeframe extends to August 2024, which is more than a year from now, there's a reasonable chance that economic conditions could change enough to prompt a policy adjustment. However, Singapore's exchange rate policy is generally stable, and major changes are infrequent. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. 2.

Central Bank of Singapore announcing a new exchange rate policy by August 2024: Singapore's monetary policy is primarily conducted through exchange rate management rather than interest rates. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reviews its exchange rate policy twice a year. While they do make adjustments to their policy from time to time, a completely 'new' exchange rate policy is relatively rare. The last major change was in October 2022 when they tightened policy to combat inflation. By August 2024, global economic conditions might have shifted, potentially prompting a policy change. However, a completely new policy, rather than an adjustment to the existing one, is less likely.

However, the Central Bank of Russia, under Nabiullina's leadership, has been actively working to control inflation. As of the latest available data (mid-2023), Russia's inflation rate has been showing signs of stabilization. The central bank has been implementing tight monetary policy to keep inflation in check. However, predicting inflation over a year in advance is challenging, especially given the ongoing geopolitical tensions and potential for further economic sanctions.

European Central Bank: The ECB has been dealing with persistent inflation in the Eurozone. As of 2023, they have been implementing rate hikes to curb inflation. However, there are several factors to consider: a) The ECB's inflation target is 2%, and if inflation shows signs of approaching this target by mid-2024, they might consider rate cuts. b) Economic growth in the Eurozone has been sluggish, and if this trend continues, it might prompt the ECB to cut rates to stimulate the economy. c) Global economic conditions, including potential recessions in major economies, could influence the ECB's decision. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of at least one of these central banks announcing a rate cut by August 2024. The ECB seems more likely to make such a move than the CBN, given the more predictable nature of the Eurozone economy and the ECB's clear inflation targeting strategy. However, central bank decisions are complex and depend on numerous factors, many of which are unpredictable this far in advance. There's still a significant chance that neither bank will announce a rate cut within the specified timeframe, especially if inflationary pressures persist or if economic growth remains stable. Considering all these factors, I estimate the probability of this question resolving as YES to be moderate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.014959560857981724, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.004986520285993908, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.18996475425420703, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

As of now (June 2024), the BoE's base rate is at a 15-year high. However, there are several factors that could lead to a rate cut by July 2024: 1. Inflation has been showing signs of easing in recent months. 2. Economic growth in the UK has been sluggish, which might prompt the BoE to stimulate the economy. 3.

The Bank of England, like many central banks, has been raising interest rates to combat inflation. However, as inflation potentially eases and economic growth concerns arise, there's a possibility of rate cuts in the future. The timeline until July 2024 provides a reasonable window for economic conditions to shift, potentially necessitating a rate cut.

However, if a strike does occur, there would be strong incentives for both parties to resolve it quickly. Let's estimate the probability of this occurring at around 20%. 2. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the US falling below 6.2% by August 2024: As of June 2023, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate in the US is around 6.7%. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which has led to higher mortgage rates. However, there are several factors that could potentially lead to lower rates by August 2024: a) The Fed might start cutting rates if inflation is brought under control or if there are signs of economic slowdown. b) Economic uncertainties or global events could lead to increased demand for US Treasuries, pushing yields down and subsequently lowering mortgage rates. c) Competition among lenders or changes in the housing market could put downward pressure on rates. Given these factors and the 14-month timeframe, there's a reasonable chance that rates could fall below 6.2%. Let's estimate this probability at around 60%. To calculate the overall probability, we need to consider the likelihood of either event occurring. Using the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), and assuming the events are independent: P(Either event) = 0.20 + 0.60 - (0.20 * 0.60) = 0.68"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.16341688479182837, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.054472294930609455, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6100407009797731, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current political climate in Indiana: Indiana is a predominantly conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature and governor's office. Historically, the state has been more inclined to restrict abortion rights rather than expand them. 2. Recent abortion legislation: In August 2022, Indiana passed a near-total abortion ban, which was later blocked by the courts. This suggests that the state government is not inclined to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a referendum by July 2024, which is just over a year away. Organizing a statewide referendum on such a contentious issue typically requires significant time for planning, legislative approval, and public debate. 4. Lack of current initiatives: As of now, there are no widely reported initiatives or movements in Indiana pushing for a referendum on abortion rights. Such a significant political move would likely have some visible groundwork if it were to occur within a year. 5. National trends: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights (e.g., Kansas, Michigan), these have typically been in response to attempts to restrict abortion access, not to enshrine rights in more conservative states. 6. Constitutional amendment process: In Indiana, amending the state constitution requires approval from two consecutive sessions of the General Assembly before going to a public vote. This process makes it highly unlikely for a referendum to occur by July 2024 without any current movement in this direction. 7. Political risk: Given Indiana's conservative leanings, Republican lawmakers would be taking a significant political risk by allowing such a referendum, as it could potentially enshrine abortion rights against their typical stance. Considering these factors, it appears highly unlikely that Indiana will hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024.

Another U.S. state adopting a Medicaid plan with a healthy behavior incentive: Currently, Georgia has implemented such a plan.

However, implementing new Medicaid plans or making significant changes to existing ones is a complex and often slow process, involving legislative approval, federal waivers, and implementation planning. Given that we have about a year until the resolution date, it's possible but not highly likely that another state will fully adopt (not just propose) such a plan in this timeframe. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. 2. Indiana not holding a referendum on abortion rights: Indiana has been restrictive on abortion rights, passing laws to limit access. However, there has been pushback against these restrictions, and some states have held referendums to protect abortion rights in response to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. That said, organizing a statewide referendum is a significant undertaking that requires substantial political will and resources. Given Indiana's conservative leaning and the lack of current news indicating plans for such a referendum, it seems more likely than not that Indiana will not hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024.

However, crop yields can be affected by various factors such as weather conditions, geopolitical situations, and agricultural policies. The requirement for a 5% increase above the five-year average is a substantial benchmark. While Russia has had successful crop seasons in recent years, consistently exceeding the average is challenging.

UNDP announcing new funding commitments over $400 million by July 2024: The UNDP regularly announces new funding commitments for various global development initiatives. However, $400 million is a significant amount. Looking at recent UNDP announcements, we can see that they do sometimes make commitments of this scale, but not frequently. For example, in 2021, the UNDP announced a $2.2 billion climate investment plan. However, such large commitments are not annual occurrences. Given the timeframe (about a year), and the fact that global development needs remain high, especially in the face of ongoing challenges like climate change and post-pandemic recovery, there's a moderate chance of such an announcement. 2. A major hospital system in France canceling over \u20ac250 million in medical debt by August 2024: This is a more unusual event. While medical debt forgiveness does occur in various countries, it's less common in France due to their universal healthcare system. However, there can still be instances of medical debt, particularly for non-covered services or for non-citizens. A cancellation of this scale (\u20ac250 million for at least 150,000 patients) would be a major event. It's not impossible, especially if there's a collaboration with a nonprofit, but it's less likely than the UNDP commitment.

Recent history: Google (Alphabet) has a history of significant layoffs. In January 2023, they announced 12,000 job cuts, which was about 6% of their workforce. 2. AI focus: Google has been heavily investing in AI and reorganizing to prioritize AI development. This shift could lead to redundancies in certain areas as the company realigns its workforce. 3. Tech industry trends: The tech industry has seen widespread layoffs in recent years, often linked to restructuring and efficiency measures. 4. Economic factors: While the economy has shown some signs of improvement, tech companies are still cautious and often look to streamline operations. 5.

The requirement for explicit linkage to the AI reorganization plan and the need for official confirmation or reputable news sources add additional constraints that slightly lower the probability.

(a) South African Reserve Bank (SARB) interest rate cut: The SARB has been maintaining a relatively high interest rate to combat inflation. As of now (June 2023), the repo rate is at 8.25%. For an interest rate cut to occur by July 2024, we would need to see a significant improvement in inflation rates and overall economic conditions in South Africa. While it's possible that economic conditions could improve over the next year, it's not highly likely given global economic uncertainties and South Africa's own economic challenges. The SARB is known for its cautious approach, and it typically prefers to keep rates stable or increase them to control inflation. An interest rate cut within a year seems somewhat unlikely, but not impossible. (b) Google layoffs: Google announced a reorganization plan focused on AI in 2023, which included some layoffs. However, the company has already undergone significant layoffs in early 2023, cutting about 12,000 jobs. Given this recent large-scale reduction, it's less likely that Google will need to lay off a large number of employees again so soon. The AI-focused reorganization might involve some job cuts, but it's plausible that these could be limited and potentially offset by new hires in AI-related roles. The threshold of 1,800 employees is relatively high for a targeted reorganization, especially following a major layoff. Therefore, it seems more likely than not that Google will lay off fewer than 1,800 employees as part of this specific AI-focused reorganization. Combining these two conditions: For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. While the Google layoff condition seems more likely to be met, the SARB interest rate cut is less certain.

However, economic conditions can change rapidly, and central banks often adjust their policies in response to economic indicators.

(a) Pennsylvania receiving over $300 million in federal grants for electric vehicle projects: The Biden administration has been pushing for increased investment in electric vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing. Pennsylvania is a key swing state with a significant automotive industry presence, making it a potential target for such investments. However, $300 million is a substantial amount for a single state, and competition for these grants is likely to be fierce. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a large grant to be approved and announced. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. (b) Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. resolving a major workers' strike: Labor disputes in the automotive industry are not uncommon, especially given recent trends of workers demanding better conditions and pay. Nissan has faced labor issues in the past, though not always resulting in major strikes. The criteria for this condition are quite specific (1000+ workers, lasting at least a week, official statements, etc.), which narrows the likelihood. However, if a strike does occur, there's a strong incentive for both parties to resolve it quickly, especially if it's significant enough to meet the criteria. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs.

Kamala Harris announcing her running mate at a rally in New York City by August 31, 2024: This scenario is highly unlikely for several reasons: a) Kamala Harris is currently the Vice President and is expected to run alongside President Biden for re-election in 2024. b) There's no precedent for a sitting Vice President to announce their own running mate. c) Even if Harris were to run separately from Biden (which is extremely unlikely), presidential candidates typically announce their running mates much closer to the party convention, which would be after August 2024. d) The specific requirement of the announcement being made at a rally in New York City adds another layer of improbability. 2. Maryland holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 31, 2024: This scenario is more plausible, but still faces some challenges: a) Maryland is generally considered a pro-choice state, with abortion rights already protected under state law. b) However, there has been a trend of states enshrining abortion rights in their constitutions following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. c) As of now, there's no concrete information about Maryland planning such a referendum. d) The timeline (by July 31, 2024) gives some time for this to potentially happen, but it would require significant political movement and organization in a relatively short period.

Historical precedent: The Central Bank of Brazil typically reviews its inflation targets periodically. The last major change was in 2017 when they lowered the target for 2019 and 2020. This suggests that they are open to adjusting targets when deemed necessary. 3. Time frame: The question gives a two-month window (July-August 2024) for the announcement. This is a relatively short period, which somewhat reduces the likelihood of an announcement occurring specifically within this timeframe. 4. Global economic trends: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the Federal Reserve, can influence Brazil's monetary policy decisions. 5. Political factors: Changes in central bank leadership or government pressure could influence the decision to announce a new target. 6.

(a) Facebook implementing court-ordered changes to its advertising policies: Facebook has been under scrutiny for antitrust concerns for several years. In 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 48 state attorneys general filed antitrust lawsuits against Facebook. These cases are ongoing and could potentially result in court-ordered changes to Facebook's advertising policies. However, antitrust cases are complex and often take years to resolve. Given that the resolution date is August 2024, which is about 14 months from now, it's possible but not highly likely that a federal court ruling would be made and implemented within this timeframe. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. (b) New York conducting a referendum on abortion rights: New York is generally considered a pro-choice state, having already codified abortion rights into state law in 2019 with the Reproductive Health Act. However, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, many states have been taking additional measures to protect abortion rights. New York has been considering further strengthening these protections, including potentially amending the state constitution. In 2022, New York lawmakers passed the first of two required votes to add the Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution, which would prohibit discrimination based on a range of factors including pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. For this to become law, it needs to pass a second legislative vote and then be approved by voters in a referendum. Given that the process has already begun and there's significant political will behind it, it's quite possible that New York could conduct this referendum by August 2024. However, the exact timing depends on legislative schedules and political priorities. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.30 + 0.60 - (0.30 * 0.60) = 0.72.

The challenge must be new (after October 1, 2023), officially filed, against a renewable energy project, and reported by at least two major news outlets.

President Biden delivering a speech at an NEA event in Arizona by July 2024: The National Education Association is a large and influential teachers' union in the United States, and it's not uncommon for presidents to address such organizations. However, the specificity of the location (Arizona) makes this less likely. Arizona is not typically a stronghold for Democrats, though it has been becoming more competitive in recent years. Given that July 2024 is during the presidential election campaign season, it's possible Biden might visit Arizona to campaign and could combine this with an NEA event. Still, the timeframe is relatively short (about a month from the question's creation date), which reduces the likelihood. 2. Wisconsin holding a referendum on public school funding by July 2024: Education funding is often a contentious issue that can lead to referendums. Wisconsin has a history of holding referendums on various issues, including school funding at local levels. However, the question specifies a state-wide referendum, which is less common and requires more political momentum. The timeframe (about a month) is very short for organizing a state-wide referendum, especially considering the formal processes required. There's no indication in the prompt that such a referendum is currently being planned or discussed in Wisconsin. Combining these factors: Both events are possible but not highly likely within the given timeframe. The Biden speech seems slightly more probable than the Wisconsin referendum due to the flexibility of campaign schedules compared to the rigidity of state-wide referendum processes. The short timeframe significantly reduces the likelihood of either event occurring. The fact that only one of these needs to happen for a YES resolution increases the overall probability somewhat.

This suggests they are actively working on integrating AI into their operations, which could lead to workforce restructuring. Economic conditions: The tech industry has been facing challenges, including economic uncertainties and a post-pandemic slowdown in growth for some companies that benefited from remote work trends. Timeframe: The question allows for a relatively long period (until July 2024) for these layoffs to occur, increasing the likelihood of the event. Threshold: The 1,800 employee threshold is significant but not unprecedented for these companies, given their recent layoff history. Industry trends: Many tech companies have been implementing layoffs as part of their AI integration strategies, aiming to reduce costs and increase efficiency. However, there are also factors that might reduce the likelihood: Previous layoffs: Both companies have already undergone significant layoffs recently, which might reduce the need for additional large-scale cuts in the near future. Public scrutiny: Large layoffs can lead to negative publicity and potential backlash, which companies might want to avoid. Talent retention: In the competitive tech industry, companies might be cautious about losing too much talent, especially as they pivot towards AI-focused strategies. Gradual implementation: Companies might opt for smaller, phased layoffs rather than a large single cut, which could result in not meeting the 1,800 threshold by the resolution date. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high chance of this event occurring. The long timeframe, the companies' focus on AI integration, and the recent history of significant layoffs in the tech industry all contribute to an increased likelihood. However, the specific requirement of 1,800 employees and the need for explicit linkage to AI-focused reorganization plans adds some uncertainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.042945812643242154, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.014315270881080719, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4233492404279062, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Michigan removing the work requirement from its Medicaid plan by July 2024: The work requirement for Medicaid in Michigan has been a contentious issue. In 2018, Michigan implemented work requirements for Medicaid recipients, but these were blocked by federal courts in 2020. With the change in federal administration and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a shift away from work requirements in Medicaid programs across the country. However, as of now, there's no clear indication that Michigan is actively planning to remove this requirement officially by July 2024. The probability of this happening is relatively low, perhaps around 20%. 2. Bank of Canada announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: The Bank of Canada, like many central banks, adjusts its interest rates based on economic conditions. As of 2023, the Bank of Canada has been maintaining higher interest rates to combat inflation. However, by August 2024, the economic landscape could change significantly. If inflation is brought under control and economic growth slows, there could be pressure to cut rates. The Bank of Canada typically moves cautiously, and a lot can happen in a year. Given the uncertainty and the time frame, I'd estimate the probability of a rate cut announcement by August 2024 at about 40%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. To calculate the probability of at least one of these independent events occurring, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) = 0.20 + 0.40 - (0.20 * 0.40) = 0.60 - 0.08 = 0.52.

The second condition seems more likely to be met than the first, as it's plausible that the legal process regarding Louisiana's ban could extend beyond August 2024 without a final declaration of constitutionality.

Given the controversial nature of such laws and the potential conflict with federal precedents, it's not guaranteed that state courts will uphold the ban. The timeframe (by August 2024) provides about 14 months for the legal process to unfold, which is a reasonable amount of time for a court decision. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. 2. Missouri conducting a referendum on abortion rights: Missouri is also a conservative state with restrictive abortion laws. However, there has been a growing trend of states holding referendums on abortion rights, even in conservative areas, often resulting in surprises (e.g., Kansas). The timeframe allows for organizing such a referendum, but it would require significant grassroots effort and political will. Given Missouri's political landscape, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. To calculate the overall probability, we need to consider the likelihood of either event occurring.

The country has been actively working on CBDC development, has announced plans for real-world testing in 2024, and has the technological capability to implement such a system. The global trend towards digital currencies and South Korea's desire to maintain its position as a fintech leader also support this likelihood. However, there's still some uncertainty due to potential unforeseen challenges or delays in development and testing.

While there's a global trend towards easing monetary policy as inflation pressures subside, emerging markets like Mexico often need to maintain higher rates for longer to ensure currency stability and control inflation.

If inflation in Mexico continues to decrease and the economy shows signs of slowing, Banxico might consider cutting rates.

As of mid-2023, they have been holding interest rates steady. However, there are several factors that could lead to a monetary easing policy: 1. Global economic slowdown: If the global economy faces challenges, Indonesia might need to stimulate its economy. 2. Inflation control: If inflation rates come under control, there might be room for easing. 3. External pressures: Changes in US Federal Reserve policies or global economic conditions might influence Indonesia's monetary policy. Given the uncertain global economic outlook and the time frame (over a year), there's a moderate chance of a policy shift. However, the requirement for an explicit announcement and reporting by major outlets adds some constraint. b) Singapore Straits Times Index reaching or exceeding 4,000 points by August 2024: As of mid-2023, the Straits Times Index (STI) is trading around 3,200-3,300 points. To reach 4,000 points, it would need to increase by about 20-25%. Factors to consider: 1. Historical performance: The STI has never reached 4,000 points before. Its all-time high was around 3,900 in 2007. 2. Economic recovery: Singapore's economy is closely tied to global trade. A strong global economic recovery could boost the index. 3. Tech sector growth: Singapore has been positioning itself as a tech hub, which could drive market growth. 4. Time frame: The question allows for over a year of market movement, which increases the chances of reaching this level. While 4,000 points is a significant milestone, the extended time frame and potential for economic recovery make this scenario possible, though still challenging.

A bumper harvest requires yields at least 10% higher than the five-year average for both corn and soybeans. The US has experienced increasingly unpredictable weather patterns due to climate change, which can affect crop yields. However, advancements in agricultural technology and farming practices have generally led to increasing yields over time. Without specific weather forecasts for the 2024 growing season, it's difficult to predict with certainty.

Spain implemented export taxes on agricultural products in response to food price inflation and supply concerns. Economic conditions and global food supply situations can change, potentially influencing policy decisions. However, once implemented, taxes often remain in place due to the revenue they generate and political inertia. Complete elimination of all agricultural export taxes is less likely than maintaining some taxes or partial reductions.

Without any current news or policy discussions pointing in this direction, this scenario seems unlikely in the given timeframe. (b) United States reporting a bumper harvest for both corn and soybeans: This scenario is more plausible. The US is a major producer of both corn and soybeans, and bumper harvests are not uncommon. However, predicting agricultural yields this far in advance is challenging due to various factors such as weather conditions, pest prevalence, and farming practices. Considering historical data: - The US has experienced bumper crops in recent years, but not consistently for both corn and soybeans in the same year. - Climate change and extreme weather events have increased the unpredictability of crop yields. - Technological advancements in agriculture are gradually improving yields over time. The requirement for both crops to have bumper harvests in the same year makes this condition more challenging to meet. While it's certainly possible, it's not highly probable. Combining the probabilities: Given that only one of these conditions needs to be met for a YES resolution, we need to consider the likelihood of either event occurring. The Spain scenario seems less likely, while the US bumper harvest scenario has a moderate chance of occurring. Probability: 0.35.

Let's analyze each condition separately: a) The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) endorsing a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election: The AFT is one of the largest teachers' unions in the United States and has a history of endorsing presidential candidates. In previous election cycles, the AFT has typically made endorsements well before July of the election year. For example, they endorsed Hillary Clinton in July 2015 for the 2016 election, and Joe Biden in March 2020 for the 2020 election. Given this pattern, it's highly likely that the AFT will endorse a candidate by July 2024, especially considering the importance of education issues in national politics. The probability of this condition being met is very high, around 0.95. b) Missouri not holding a referendum on abortion rights: Missouri has been a battleground state for abortion rights, with restrictive laws in place. There has been ongoing debate and legal challenges regarding abortion rights in Missouri. However, organizing and conducting a statewide referendum is a complex and time-consuming process. As of now, there's no clear indication that such a referendum is being actively planned or pushed for in Missouri. The short timeframe (about a year) makes it less likely for a referendum to be organized, approved, and conducted by July 2024. The probability of Missouri not holding such a referendum by July 2024 is moderately high, around 0.75. For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. We can calculate this by multiplying the probabilities of each condition: 0.95 (AFT endorsement) * 0.75 (No Missouri referendum) = 0.7125.

(a) Missouri holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024: The likelihood of this occurring is relatively low. Missouri is a conservative state that has already implemented strict abortion laws. While there have been efforts in some states to enshrine abortion rights in their constitutions following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Missouri hasn't shown significant movement in this direction. Additionally, organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that requires time for planning, approval, and implementation. Given that the resolution date is July 31, 2024, and this question was created on June 30, 2024, there's only a month for this to occur, which is an extremely short timeframe for organizing such a referendum.

(b) American Federation of Teachers endorsing a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election by July 2024: This is much more likely to occur. The AFT typically endorses candidates in presidential elections, and they usually do so well before the election. In the 2020 election cycle, the AFT endorsed Joe Biden in March 2020, about 8 months before the election. The 2024 presidential election will be in November, so July 2024 is a reasonable timeframe for such an endorsement to occur. Given that this question was created just a month before the resolution date, it's highly likely that the AFT has already made or is very close to making their endorsement.

This suggests a significant and widespread issue. 2. Typical duration of West Nile virus outbreaks: West Nile virus is a seasonal epidemic in North America that flares up in the summer and continues into the fall. Outbreaks typically last for a few months, but can persist longer in some cases. 3. Time frame for resolution: The question asks about the outbreak being declared over by August 31, 2024, which is only two months from the creation date of the question. This is a relatively short period for a global outbreak to be completely resolved. 4. WHO declaration process: The WHO typically declares an outbreak over when there have been no new cases for a certain period, usually twice the incubation period of the disease. For West Nile virus, the incubation period is typically 2-6 days, but can range up to 14 days. This means the WHO would likely want to see no new cases for at least 28 days before declaring the outbreak over. 5. Global nature of the outbreak: Given that this outbreak has prompted global responses, it's likely affecting multiple countries or regions. Coordinating and confirming the end of the outbreak across various locations could take considerable time. 6. Seasonal factors: West Nile virus is more prevalent in summer and early fall. August is still within this peak season, making it less likely for the outbreak to be declared over by this time. 7. Public health measures: The effectiveness and speed of implementation of public health measures to control the outbreak will play a crucial role. However, given the short timeframe, it would require an exceptionally rapid and successful response to end the outbreak by August. Considering these factors, it seems unlikely that the WHO would declare this West Nile virus outbreak over by August 31, 2024.

(b) Land O'Frost issuing a recall of deli meats due to a listeria outbreak by August 2024: Listeria outbreaks in deli meats are not uncommon in the food industry. According to the CDC, deli meats are a known risk factor for listeria infections. Food recalls due to potential listeria contamination happen several times a year across various brands. Land O'Frost, being a major producer of deli meats, is at risk for such an event. Considering that: 1.

Federal Reserve policy: If the Fed starts cutting interest rates due to economic slowdown or reduced inflation, mortgage rates could fall. 2. Economic conditions: A recession or significant economic slowdown could lead to lower rates. 3. Inflation trends: If inflation continues to cool, it could lead to lower interest rates.

This suggests that the court is closely divided on the issue, which could lead to potential challenges to the current law. 2. Political landscape: Iowa has a Republican-controlled legislature and a Republican governor who signed the bill into law. This makes a legislative repeal unlikely in the short term. 3. Public opinion: Abortion rights have been a contentious issue nationwide, with many states seeing pushback against strict abortion laws. However, Iowa is a relatively conservative state, which may impact public pressure on this issue. 4. Timeframe: The question gives about a year for the law to be overturned. This is a relatively short period for significant legal or legislative changes to occur, especially considering the slow pace of court proceedings. 5. Precedent in other states: Some states with similar laws have seen them challenged and temporarily blocked by courts. This could provide a basis for legal challenges in Iowa. 6.

Let's analyze each part separately and then combine our assessments. 1. Colorado's abortion law remaining unchanged by August 2024: Colorado has a history of being relatively progressive on abortion rights. The current law allowing abortions up to 22 weeks was passed in 2022, reflecting the state's general support for reproductive rights. Given that Democrats control both chambers of the state legislature and the governorship, it's unlikely that the law will be restricted. However, there's always a possibility of attempts to expand access beyond 22 weeks. The stability of this law seems fairly high, but not certain. 2. Iowa's 6-week abortion ban remaining in effect through July 2024: Iowa's 6-week abortion ban, also known as the 'fetal heartbeat' law, has faced legal challenges. It was initially blocked by the courts in 2018 but was revived in 2023 after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The law is currently in effect but is still facing ongoing legal challenges. Given the contentious nature of such laws and the potential for court interventions, there's a significant risk that this law could be overturned or modified before July 2024. Combining these factors: For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. While Colorado's law seems relatively stable, Iowa's law is on shakier ground. The requirement for both to remain unchanged increases the likelihood of a NO resolution. Additionally, the time frame (until August 2024) is relatively long in political terms, providing more opportunity for changes to occur in either state. This extended period increases the chances of legislative action, court decisions, or other factors affecting these laws.

(a) Iowa's 6-week abortion ban being overturned by July 2024: Iowa's 6-week abortion ban is a highly controversial law that has faced significant legal challenges. The Iowa Supreme Court deadlocked on the issue in 2022, leaving a lower court's decision to block the law in place. However, in 2023, Governor Kim Reynolds signed a new version of the 6-week ban into law. Given the contentious nature of this law and the ongoing legal battles, there is a moderate chance that it could be overturned by July 2024. The timeframe of about a year provides enough time for legal challenges to make their way through the courts. However, with a conservative-leaning state government and Supreme Court, the chances are not overwhelmingly high. (b) Colorado's abortion law being changed by August 2024: Colorado has one of the most permissive abortion laws in the United States, allowing procedures up to 22 weeks. This law is relatively new, having been passed in 2022, and reflects the state's generally liberal stance on abortion rights. Given the recent passage of this law and the state's political leanings, it seems less likely that this law would be changed within the given timeframe.

Maduro and Machado are political opponents, with Machado being a prominent opposition leader. 2.

As of now (June 2023), the RBI has been maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy to combat inflation. However, by July 2024, which is more than a year away, the economic landscape could change significantly. If inflation shows signs of cooling and economic growth needs a boost, the RBI might consider cutting rates. However, given the current stance and the uncertainty of future economic conditions, the probability of a rate cut by July 2024 seems moderate, perhaps around 40%. 2. Oracle announcing measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption: The tech industry, including major players like Oracle, is under increasing pressure to address the environmental impact of their operations, particularly concerning AI-related energy consumption. As AI becomes more prevalent and energy-intensive, companies are likely to face both regulatory and public pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Oracle, being a significant player in the cloud and AI space, may well be working on such initiatives already. The timeframe until July 2024 gives them ample time to develop and announce such measures. Given the industry trends and growing importance of sustainability, the probability of Oracle making such an announcement by July 2024 seems relatively high, perhaps around 60%.

California, being a leader in electric vehicle adoption and having a large automotive industry, is well-positioned to receive such grants. The state has also been proactive in seeking federal funding for clean energy initiatives.

President Biden not delivering a speech at a National Education Association event in Illinois by July 2024: This condition is also likely to be met, but for different reasons. While President Biden has strong ties to education unions and has spoken at NEA events in the past, several factors make it unlikely he'll speak at an NEA event specifically in Illinois by July 2024: - The timeframe is relatively short (about a year). - Illinois is not typically a swing state, so there may be less political motivation to make appearances there. - Presidential schedules are busy and often prioritize events in Washington D.C. or in politically strategic locations. - There's no guarantee that the NEA will even hold a significant event in Illinois during this period. However, we must consider that as we approach the 2024 election, Biden may increase his public appearances and speeches, which could include an NEA event in Illinois. When we combine these two conditions, we see that both are individually likely, but the probability of both occurring together is naturally lower than either occurring individually. The electric vehicle grants seem more likely than not, while Biden not speaking at an NEA event in Illinois is also more likely than not, but less certain. The final probability reflects that while both conditions are more likely than not to occur, there is still a significant chance that one or both conditions may not be met.

(a) Hyundai Motor Company resolving a major workers' strike by July 2024: Hyundai has a history of labor disputes, with strikes occurring relatively frequently in South Korea.

The conditions set for this part (1,000+ workers, lasting at least a week, official statements, and reputable news coverage) are not particularly stringent for a major automotive company like Hyundai.

I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 70%. (b) No major hospital system in the Northeast US canceling over $300 million in medical debt by August 2024: Medical debt cancellation has become more common in recent years, with several hospitals and health systems across the US engaging in such initiatives. However, the specific conditions here ($300 million+ for 150,000+ patients across multiple Northeastern states) make this a significant undertaking. While not impossible, it would be a major event. Given the increasing awareness of medical debt issues and the precedent set by other hospitals, there's a chance such an event could occur. However, the Northeast specifically has fewer examples of such large-scale debt cancellations compared to other regions. I would estimate the probability of no such cancellation occurring (i.e., this condition being met) at around 75%. Combining these probabilities: For both conditions to be met (the question to resolve YES), we need both events to occur independently. We multiply the probabilities: 0.70 * 0.75 = 0.525 or 52.5%. This suggests that the probability of both conditions being met is slightly higher than 50%, but not by a large margin.

While specific numbers weren't initially disclosed, layoffs in tech companies, especially during reorganizations, are not uncommon. IBM has a history of periodic restructuring and layoffs. The target of 1,800 employees is relatively modest for a company of IBM's size (around 350,000 employees globally). Given the ongoing AI transformation in the tech industry and IBM's focus on this area, it's plausible that they might conduct layoffs to streamline operations and redirect resources. However, the specific number (1,800) and the explicit link to the AI reorganization make this condition somewhat uncertain. b) Tiff Macklem remaining as Governor of the Bank of Canada: Tiff Macklem was appointed as the Governor of the Bank of Canada in June 2020 for a seven-year term. His term is set to end in June 2027, which is well beyond the July 2024 deadline for this question. Barring any unforeseen circumstances such as resignation or removal, it is highly likely that Macklem will still be in his position by July 31, 2024. Combining these factors: The probability of the second condition (Macklem remaining Governor) is very high, likely above 90%. Even if the IBM layoffs don't occur or don't meet the specific criteria, this condition alone makes it highly probable that the question will resolve as YES. The IBM layoff condition, while less certain, adds to the overall probability. If we estimate its likelihood at around 40-50%, it further increases the chances of a YES resolution.

Global economic trends: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, can influence Chile's monetary policy decisions. 3. Time frame: The question gives a relatively long time frame (until August 2024), which increases the likelihood of a rate cut occurring within this period. 4. Historical patterns: Central banks typically adjust rates gradually, and after a period of high rates to combat inflation, they often begin to reduce rates as inflation comes under control. 5.

External factors: Chile's economy is influenced by commodity prices (particularly copper) and global trade conditions, which could impact the decision to cut rates. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high probability that the Central Bank of Chile will announce a rate cut by August 2024. The long time frame allows for current inflationary pressures to potentially ease, giving the central bank room to start reducing rates. Additionally, if global economic conditions soften, this could prompt rate cuts to stimulate the economy. However, there is still uncertainty. If inflation remains persistent or if there are unforeseen economic shocks, the central bank might delay rate cuts.

However, global economic trends and the typical cycle of interest rates suggest that there's a moderate chance of a rate cut within the next 14 months.

Given the relatively recent implementation of these restrictions, it seems unlikely that Ohio would enact new laws modifying these restrictions so soon. Typically, states tend to maintain their stance on such controversial issues for longer periods before considering changes.

South Carolina refraining from enacting new laws modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth: As of now, South Carolina does not have specific laws restricting gender-affirming care for transgender youth.

This is a relatively short period for significant legislative changes, especially on a controversial topic. 4. National trends: There's been a wave of restrictive legislation regarding transgender rights across many states in recent years. This trend might continue, making it less likely for these states to relax restrictions. 5.

However, the timeline for such challenges and subsequent legislative action is often longer than the given timeframe. 6. Public opinion: While public opinion on transgender rights is evolving, change tends to be slower in conservative states like South Carolina and Ohio. 7.

Let's analyze each condition separately: (a) Bahraini health ministry confirming more than one case of polio in Manama: Bahrain has been polio-free for decades, and the country has a robust vaccination program. The last reported case of polio in Bahrain was in 1994. The country has maintained high immunization coverage, with over 95% of children receiving polio vaccines. Additionally, Manama is a modern city with good sanitation and healthcare systems, which further reduces the risk of polio outbreaks. The likelihood of multiple polio cases occurring in Manama and being officially confirmed is very low. It would require a significant breakdown in the vaccination program, a major influx of unvaccinated individuals, or a new strain of the virus that can bypass existing immunity. (b) WHO not declaring the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak over: As of June 2023, the WHO has not yet declared the COVID-19 pandemic over. While many countries have lifted restrictions and are treating COVID-19 as endemic, the virus continues to circulate globally, and new variants continue to emerge. The WHO is likely to be cautious about declaring the end of the pandemic, given the potential for new variants and the uneven global distribution of vaccines. However, by August 2024, which is more than a year from now, there's a good chance that the situation will have improved significantly enough for the WHO to consider ending the Public Health Emergency of International Concern status. Combining these factors: The probability of condition (a) occurring is extremely low, while the probability of condition (b) occurring is moderate to low. For both conditions to be met, we need the unlikely event of a polio outbreak in Manama AND the continuation of the COVID-19 emergency status. The combination of these two events is even less likely than either event occurring independently. The very low probability (1%) reflects the extremely unlikely scenario of both a polio outbreak in a well-vaccinated city and the continuation of the COVID-19 emergency status for over a year from now. While it's not impossible, it would require a series of highly improbable events to occur simultaneously."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "fcb79b49-b885-46cf-99d6-eb92b7f977ae", "title": "Will either the WHO declare the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak over or Bahrain confirm multiple polio cases in Manama by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if either of the following occurs by August 31, 2024: (a) The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declares the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak over.

Part A: WHO declaring the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak over by August 2024. The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing since early 2020, and while many countries have lifted restrictions, the virus continues to circulate globally. The WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, and only recently ended this status on May 5, 2023. However, ending the PHEIC doesn't mean the outbreak is over. The WHO still considers COVID-19 a global health threat. Given the virus's ability to mutate and the challenges in global vaccination efforts, it's unlikely that the WHO will declare the outbreak completely over by August 2024. The WHO tends to be cautious in such declarations to avoid premature relaxation of vigilance. Probability for Part A: 0.1 (10% chance). Part B: Bahrain confirming multiple polio cases in Manama by August 2024. Bahrain, like many countries in the region, has been polio-free for decades. The country has a robust vaccination program and good healthcare infrastructure. Polio outbreaks are rare in countries with strong public health systems. However, polio cases have occurred in previously polio-free countries due to vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreaks. The Middle East has seen some VDPV cases in recent years, particularly in areas with lower vaccination rates or disrupted health services. Manama is a major urban center with better healthcare access, making an outbreak less likely than in more remote areas. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for multiple cases to emerge and be confirmed, especially given Bahrain's likely quick response to any detected case. Probability for Part B: 0.02 (2% chance). Combined probability: To calculate the probability of either event occurring, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

Swiss National Bank (SNB) interest rate cut announcement by August 2024: The SNB has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation. As of now, the policy rate stands at 1.75%. However, given the global economic uncertainties and potential slowdown, there's a possibility that the SNB might consider a rate cut if inflation pressures ease significantly. The timeframe until August 2024 is relatively long, which increases the chances of economic conditions changing enough to warrant a rate cut. However, the SNB is known for its conservative approach, and unless there's a significant economic downturn or deflationary pressures, they might be hesitant to cut rates. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 30%. 2. Brazil's monthly job growth falling below 50,000 in any single month by July 2024: Brazil's job market has been relatively robust, with monthly job creation often exceeding 100,000. However, economic conditions can be volatile, especially in emerging markets like Brazil. Political changes, global economic factors, or domestic issues could lead to a temporary slowdown in job growth. The timeframe of about 13 months (from now until July 2024) provides multiple opportunities for a single month to dip below 50,000 job growth. Given the volatility and the extended timeframe, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 45%. Combining probabilities: Since we need either event to occur for a YES resolution, we can use the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.30 + 0.45 - (0.30 * 0.45) = 0.75 - 0.135 = 0.615.

Kamala Harris not announcing her running mate at a rally in Charlotte by August 2024: - Traditionally, vice presidential candidates don't choose their own running mates. This role typically falls to the presidential nominee. - As of now, there's no indication that Kamala Harris will be the Democratic presidential nominee for 2024. - Even if she were to become the nominee, the choice of Charlotte for such an announcement is highly specific and not particularly likely. - Running mate announcements are often made through press releases or in the nominee's home state, rather than at rallies in specific cities. - The timeframe (by August 2024) does align with the typical timeline for running mate announcements in presidential election years.

PepsiCo has been adapting to these trends by diversifying its product portfolio and focusing on healthier alternatives. The company has also been investing in marketing and innovation.

The People's Bank of China has a history of using monetary policy, including interest rate cuts, to stimulate economic growth.

Timeframe: The question asks about the period until July 2024, which gives the country over a year to maintain positive growth or recover from any potential downturn. Considering these factors, there are several reasons to be optimistic about South Korea's ability to avoid a recession: - The country's recent positive GDP growth suggests a stable economic foundation. - The government's proactive measures to support the economy can help mitigate risks. - South Korea's strong export sectors, particularly in technology, are likely to continue performing well as global demand for these products remains high. - The country has a track record of economic resilience and adaptability. However, there are also potential risks: - Global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, could impact South Korea's export-driven economy. - Any significant downturn in major trading partners like China or the United States could have ripple effects on South Korea's economy.

Historical context: In recent years, there have been numerous instances of social media platforms and AI technologies being implicated in the spread of misinformation, including during election periods.

The combination of rapid AI development, the critical pre-election period, and increased scrutiny makes it quite possible that such an incident could occur and be credibly reported.

Part A: New AI platform reported for spreading election misinformation - The resolution date is August 31, 2024, which is shortly before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. This timing increases the likelihood of election-related misinformation being a significant concern. Given the rapid development of AI technology, it's likely that new AI platforms will emerge by August 2024. We've seen social media platforms and AI tools being used to spread misinformation in previous elections. It's reasonable to expect this trend to continue or even intensify with more advanced AI. With growing awareness of AI's potential impact on elections, there will likely be heightened vigilance from election officials, government authorities, and news organizations.

Part B: Bloomberg Philanthropies announcing a $600 million donation to Hispanic-serving universities - Michael Bloomberg has a track record of large philanthropic donations, including to educational institutions. The question specifies a precise amount ($600 million) and a specific type of institution (Hispanic-serving universities), which makes it less likely than a more general donation. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for planning and announcing such a large, targeted donation. While Bloomberg Philanthropies does support education initiatives, there's no public indication of a specific focus on Hispanic-serving universities at this scale.

This suggests that 4,000 points is a significant milestone. 2. Current level: As of June 2023, the STI is trading around 3,200-3,300 points. This means it needs to gain approximately 20-25% to reach 4,000 points. 3. Time frame: The question allows for a 14-month period (October 2023 to August 2024) for the index to reach this level, which is a reasonable amount of time for significant market movements. 4. Economic factors: Singapore's economy is heavily dependent on global trade and financial services. The global economic outlook for 2023-2024 is uncertain due to factors like inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. 5. Regional factors: The performance of other Asian markets, particularly China, can significantly influence the STI. 6.

Policy measures: The Monetary Authority of Singapore's policies can influence the market's performance. 8. Intraday highs: The question specifies that intraday highs count, which increases the chances of reaching 4,000 points compared to requiring a closing price at that level. Given these factors, reaching 4,000 points is certainly possible but not highly probable. The index would need to see substantial growth in a relatively short period, surpassing its all-time high by a significant margin. While the extended time frame and the inclusion of intraday highs increase the chances, the current economic uncertainties and the historical performance of the index suggest that this is still a challenging target.

Condition A: WHO declares the current bird flu outbreak over by August 2024. The bird flu outbreak has been a significant concern, but its severity and duration can vary. Given that this question was created in June 2024, and the resolution date is August 2024, there's only a two-month window for the WHO to declare the outbreak over. This is a relatively short timeframe, and without specific information about the current state of the outbreak, it's difficult to be certain. However, if the outbreak has been ongoing for some time, there's a moderate chance it could be declared over within this period. Let's estimate this probability at around 40%.

The Singapore Straits Times Index (STI) is currently below 4,000 points (as of 2023), and reaching 4,000 would represent a significant milestone.

Given the current global economic uncertainties and the relatively short timeframe (about 14 months from the creation date to the resolution date), it seems unlikely that the STI would reach 4,000 points.

Reaching 4,000 points would require a significant increase of about 25-30% in less than a year. While such growth is not impossible, it's quite ambitious given current global economic uncertainties. However, if global economic conditions improve significantly or if there's a strong rally in Singapore's key sectors, it could happen. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at about 30%. b) WHO declaring the current bird flu outbreak over: The current bird flu outbreak has been ongoing for several years, with periodic flare-ups in various parts of the world. The WHO typically declares an outbreak over when there have been no new cases for a certain period, usually twice the incubation period of the disease. For avian influenza, this could be several weeks to a few months. Given the widespread nature of the current outbreak and its persistence in wild bird populations, it's unlikely that it will be completely eradicated soon. However, if control measures are highly effective or if the virus naturally becomes less virulent, a declaration could be made. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring by August 2024 at about 20%. Combining probabilities: For the question to resolve as YES, we need either event to occur.

Historical performance: Hyundai has shown strong financial performance in recent years, with occasional significant year-over-year increases in net income. 2. Industry trends: The automotive industry is undergoing rapid changes, with a shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) and increased focus on sustainability. 3. Hyundai's EV strategy: The company has been investing heavily in electric vehicles, which could potentially drive growth and profitability. 4. Global economic conditions: Economic uncertainties, supply chain issues, and inflation could impact Hyundai's performance. 5. Competition: The automotive market is highly competitive, with traditional and new EV manufacturers vying for market share. 6. Time frame: The question allows for any quarter up to July 2024, giving multiple opportunities for a 20%+ increase. 7. Low base effect: If Hyundai had a particularly weak quarter in the previous year, it would be easier to achieve a 20%+ increase. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to good chance of Hyundai achieving a 20%+ year-over-year increase in net income for at least one quarter by July 2024. The company's focus on EVs and potential for growth in this sector could drive significant increases in profitability. Additionally, the multiple quarters available for comparison increase the likelihood of meeting this threshold.

However, the company has also been benefiting from strong demand for its vehicles and strategic pricing. In recent quarters, Hyundai has reported significant year-over-year increases in net income, sometimes exceeding 20%. The automotive industry is cyclical and subject to various external factors, making it difficult to consistently achieve such high growth rates. It's plausible that Hyundai might have at least one quarter where its net income doesn't increase by over 20% year-over-year.

(a) Hyundai's quarterly net income increasing by over 20% year-over-year: Hyundai is a major global automaker that has shown resilience and adaptability in recent years. However, achieving a 20% year-over-year increase in quarterly net income is a significant challenge, especially given current global economic uncertainties. Factors to consider: The automotive industry is facing challenges such as supply chain disruptions and chip shortages, which could impact production and sales. Hyundai has been investing heavily in electric vehicles, which could potentially boost sales but also increase costs in the short term. Economic slowdowns in major markets could affect consumer demand for vehicles. Hyundai has shown strong performance in recent quarters, making a 20% increase over already high numbers more challenging. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of Hyundai achieving a 20% increase in quarterly net income by July 2024 at around 40%. (b) The French economy avoiding a recession: France, like many European economies, faces challenges but also has several factors in its favor: The French economy has shown resilience in recent years, despite global challenges. The government has implemented measures to support economic growth and employment. France has a diverse economy, which can help buffer against sector-specific downturns. However, factors like high inflation, energy costs, and potential global economic slowdowns pose risks. The European Central Bank's monetary policies will also play a crucial role.

In 2019, the state passed a 'trigger law' that went into effect after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, banning nearly all abortions except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. Given this existing legislation, it's less likely that the Arkansas Senate would pass an even stricter total abortion ban by July 2024. However, it's not impossible, as some lawmakers might push for removing even the life-of-the-mother exception. The probability of this happening is relatively low, perhaps around 20-30%. (b) Georgia not holding a referendum on voting rights: Georgia has been at the center of voting rights debates in recent years, particularly after the 2020 election and subsequent changes to voting laws. However, holding a constitutional referendum is a significant step that requires substantial political will and legislative action. As of now, there doesn't seem to be any strong indication that Georgia is planning such a referendum. The absence of a referendum is more likely than its occurrence. The probability of Georgia not holding such a referendum by July 2024 is quite high, perhaps around 80-90%. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities: Let's say the probability of (a) is 0.25 and the probability of (b) is 0.85. 0.25 * 0.85 = 0.2125. This calculation suggests that the probability of both conditions being met is around 21.25%. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent. The political climate that might push Arkansas towards an even stricter abortion ban could be correlated with factors that would make Georgia less likely to hold a voting rights referendum. This correlation could slightly increase the joint probability. Taking all of this into account, I would estimate the probability to be slightly higher than the simple multiplication would suggest."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "84759b17-79d8-46fd-8b62-3cfcd9b6c16e", "title": "Will either Georgia hold a referendum on voting rights or the Arkansas Senate pass a total abortion ban by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if at least one of the following occurs by July 31, 2024: (a) Georgia holds a referendum on enshrining voting rights in its state constitution.

Additionally, with only about a month left until the resolution date, there's very little time for such a significant political process to be organized and executed. The short timeframe makes this scenario highly improbable. 2. Arkansas Senate passing a total abortion ban: Arkansas already has some of the strictest abortion laws in the United States. In 2021, the state passed a near-total abortion ban, which was later blocked by federal courts. Given this recent history, it's possible that the Arkansas Senate might attempt to pass another strict abortion law. However, with the current legal landscape and the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, many states have already enacted their desired abortion restrictions. It's unclear whether Arkansas would see a need to pass an even stricter law in such a short timeframe. Considering both scenarios: - The Georgia referendum is highly unlikely due to the lack of current plans and the extremely short timeframe. - The Arkansas abortion ban is slightly more plausible but still unlikely given the existing strict laws and the short timeframe.

Economic factors: The airline industry is sensitive to disruptions, and both companies and unions typically have strong incentives to resolve disputes quickly to minimize financial losses. 5. Legal framework: In the US, the Railway Labor Act governs labor relations in the airline industry, which includes provisions for mediation and cooling-off periods, making prolonged strikes less likely. 6.

The labor market remains strong, and consumer spending has been robust. However, there are concerns about the lagged effects of monetary tightening and potential stress in the banking sector. Most economists still predict a mild recession in late 2023 or early 2024, but the probability of avoiding a recession has increased in recent months. Given the current economic indicators and the Federal Reserve's careful approach, I would estimate the probability of avoiding a recession by July 2024 at about 60%.

While cyberattacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, major companies are also improving their defenses. The likelihood of NTT Group experiencing a severe breach that would lead to paying a hacker to erase data is relatively low. Moreover, even if such an incident occurred, companies often try to handle these situations discreetly to protect their reputation.

(a) NTT Group confirming a payment to a hacker: This scenario is quite specific and relatively rare. Major companies are generally reluctant to pay ransoms or admit to doing so publicly, as it can encourage further attacks and damage their reputation. NTT Group is a large, reputable company that likely has strong cybersecurity measures in place. While cyberattacks do happen, the likelihood of NTT Group both paying a ransom and publicly confirming it within the given timeframe is low. I would estimate this probability at around 5-10%. (b) U.S. economy avoiding a recession: This is the more likely scenario of the two. As of now (June 2023), the U.S. economy has shown resilience despite high inflation and interest rate hikes. While there are concerns about a potential recession, many economists believe it might be mild if it occurs. The Federal Reserve is actively working to achieve a 'soft landing.' Given the current economic indicators and the relatively short timeframe (until July 2024), there's a good chance the U.S. could avoid two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. I would estimate the probability of avoiding a recession at around 60-70%. Since the question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of them happening. Using the higher estimates for a more optimistic scenario: P(Either) = 1 - P(Neither) = 1 - (0.9 * 0.3) = 0.73.

However, I don't have specific information about metal contamination recalls from JBS USA. 2. Industry trends: Metal contamination is a known issue in the food industry. Foreign object contamination, including metal, is one of the top reasons for food recalls in the United States. 3. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 14 months (from the creation date to the resolution date). This is a significant amount of time during which an incident could occur. 4. Company size and production volume: JBS USA is one of the largest meat processing companies in the United States. With high production volumes, the risk of contamination increases. 5. Quality control measures: Large companies like JBS USA typically have stringent quality control measures in place, which reduce the likelihood of contamination. However, no system is perfect. 6. Detection methods: Modern food processing facilities often use metal detectors and X-ray machines to detect metal contamination, but these methods are not 100% foolproof. 7. Reporting requirements: Food companies are required to report potential contamination issues, which increases the likelihood of a recall being announced if an issue is detected. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a metal contamination recall occurring within the specified timeframe. The large production volume and the extended time frame increase the risk, while the company's likely robust quality control measures mitigate it somewhat. The probability of 0.35 reflects that while metal contamination recalls do occur in the food industry, they are not extremely common for any single company.

Given that the resolution date is only about a month after the specified date for this condition (July 31, 2024), there's a good chance the recall will still be in effect. 4.

While metal contamination in food products is not extremely common, it does occur occasionally in the food industry. Factors to consider: The timeframe is relatively short (about 2 months from the question's creation date to the resolution date). JBS USA has had recalls in the past, though not necessarily for metal contamination. Metal contamination can occur due to equipment failures or manufacturing issues.

FDA recalls can last for extended periods, especially if the issues that prompted the recall are not quickly resolved. The recall affects multiple product types (chocolate bars, cones, and gummies), which suggests a potentially widespread issue. The resolution date for this condition is only one month from the question's creation, giving little time for the recall to be lifted.

Education is a priority for many Americans, and such a drastic cut would likely face significant public opposition. 2. The current political climate doesn't suggest a strong push for such severe education budget cuts. 3. Even if proposed, such a bill would likely face strong opposition in the Senate, especially if it's not controlled by a single party with a large majority. 4. Historically, large budget cuts to education are rare and politically unpopular. The probability of this occurring by mid-2024 is very low, perhaps around 5%. b) Stanford University fully covering tuition for lower-income undergraduate students: This scenario is more plausible: 1. Many top universities have been expanding their financial aid programs in recent years to improve accessibility and diversity. 2. Stanford is one of the wealthiest universities in the world, with a large endowment that could potentially support such a program. 3. Similar policies have been implemented at other elite institutions (e.g., Harvard, MIT) for families earning less than $75,000 or $90,000 annually. 4. Stanford already has generous financial aid policies, so this would be an extension of existing efforts rather than a completely new initiative. However, there are some factors that make it less certain: 1. The specified income threshold ($100,000) is higher than what most universities currently offer for full tuition coverage. 2. Stanford might choose to enhance its financial aid in other ways rather than adopting this specific policy. 3. The timeline (by mid-2024) is relatively short for implementing such a significant change.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been maintaining a relatively stable interest rate policy in recent years, focusing on balancing growth and inflation. 2. India's economy has been showing resilience and growth, which might not necessitate an interest rate cut. 3. The RBI is known for its cautious approach to monetary policy changes, often preferring to hold rates steady unless there's a compelling reason to cut. Global context: 1. By 2024, many central banks might be pivoting towards more accommodative monetary policies as the effects of previous rate hikes take hold and inflation potentially moderates. 2. However, this trend might not be uniform across all economies, especially for emerging markets like India that might prioritize stability.

While challenges in state courts are possible, the conservative nature of the Texas judiciary makes success unlikely. The timeframe (by July 2024) is also relatively short for such a significant legal change. Probability for (a): ~20% (b) Microsoft's AI chatbot not being reported for spreading election misinformation by August 2024: This is more likely to occur. Microsoft has significant resources and expertise in AI development and is likely to be very cautious about election-related content, especially given the scrutiny on tech companies regarding misinformation. They are likely to implement strict content filters and monitoring systems to prevent the spread of election misinformation. However, AI systems can be unpredictable, and the 2024 U.S. presidential election will be a high-stakes event with intense scrutiny on all information sources. Even a small mistake could lead to reports of misinformation. Probability for (b): ~70% For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14 or 14%.

(a) Microsoft's AI chatbot spreading election misinformation: AI chatbots have been known to occasionally provide inaccurate information or be manipulated. The 2024 U.S. presidential election will be a high-stakes event with potential for misinformation. Microsoft, being a major tech company, is likely to implement safeguards and content moderation. However, the complexity of AI systems and the volume of interactions make it challenging to prevent all instances of misinformation.

(b) Texas's 6-week abortion ban being overturned: The Texas abortion law (SB 8) has been controversial and faced legal challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v.

This practice, while responsible, could increase the likelihood of a recall being issued. Given these factors, I believe the probability of a recall occurring is low, but not negligible.

However, Columbus Craft Meats is a reputable company that likely has strict quality control measures in place. Still, no system is perfect, and recalls do happen in the industry.

While not all of these lead to recalls, they do indicate the presence of the bacteria in the food supply. The timeframe given (about 14 months from now) is relatively long, increasing the chances of an incident occurring. 2. FDA recall of ground coriander due to lead contamination by July 2024: Lead contamination in spices, particularly those imported from certain countries, has been a recurring issue. Coriander is widely used and often imported, which increases the risk. The FDA regularly tests for heavy metals in food products, including spices. In recent years, there have been several instances of spice recalls due to lead contamination. For example, in 2021, the FDA announced a recall of ground coriander due to lead contamination. This precedent suggests that such an event is certainly possible within the given timeframe. Considering both events: The timeframe for both events is relatively long (over a year), which increases the likelihood of at least one occurring. These events are largely independent of each other, which means we need to consider the probability of either happening. Given the frequency of food recalls in general, the specific risks associated with ready-to-eat meats and imported spices, and the extended timeframe, there is a significant chance that at least one of these events will occur. However, it's important to note that while recalls do happen regularly in the food industry, the majority of products do not face recalls.

Germany maintaining its ban on nuclear power through August 2024: Germany has been committed to phasing out nuclear power for years, with the last nuclear power plants shutting down in April 2023. The country has invested heavily in renewable energy sources and has shown no signs of reversing this decision. However, energy security concerns due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and climate change goals might put pressure on the government to reconsider. Still, given the strong public sentiment against nuclear power and the political commitment to the phase-out, it's highly likely that Germany will maintain its ban through August 2024. I'd estimate this probability at about 0.9. 2. Zelenskyy not publicly condemning a Russian aerial attack on Kyiv by August 2024: This condition is much less likely to be met. Zelenskyy has consistently and strongly condemned Russian attacks on Ukrainian soil, especially in Kyiv. It's highly improbable that he would not condemn a Russian aerial attack on the capital city, given his track record and the political implications of staying silent. The only scenarios where this might occur are if: a) There are no Russian aerial attacks on Kyiv until August 2024 (unlikely given the ongoing conflict). b) Zelenskyy is no longer president (possible but not highly probable). c) There's a dramatic shift in Ukraine's stance towards Russia (very unlikely). Given these considerations, the probability of Zelenskyy not condemning a Russian attack on Kyiv is very low, perhaps around 0.05.

Zelenskyy has consistently condemned such attacks in the past, and it's very probable he will continue to do so. The criteria for the condemnation are specific but not particularly stringent, and align with Zelenskyy's usual response to such attacks.

Complexity of the decision: Eliminating all export taxes on agricultural products is a major decision that would require careful consideration of its impact on domestic prices, food security, and government revenue. 5. Partial measures: The question specifically states that partial reductions or eliminations for only some products are not sufficient for a YES resolution. This makes a YES outcome even less likely. 6. International pressure: While there might be some international pressure to reduce trade barriers, there's no immediate indication that Vietnam is under significant pressure to eliminate these taxes completely. 7. Economic recovery post-COVID: Vietnam, like many countries, is still focusing on economic recovery post-pandemic. Major policy changes that could potentially impact government revenue might be approached cautiously. 8. Historical precedent: Vietnam has made gradual changes to its export tax policies in the past, but a complete elimination across all agricultural products in such a short time frame would be unprecedented. Given these factors, especially the very short time frame, the lack of any recent indications of such a policy change, and the requirement for a complete (not partial) elimination of taxes, it seems highly unlikely that Vietnam will eliminate export taxes on all agricultural products by July 2024."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "94fa29a6-3366-45f4-871e-bc2f871310dc", "title": "Will Thailand eliminate and Vietnam maintain export taxes on agricultural products by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following conditions are met by July 31, 2024: (a) The Thai government officially announces or implements a policy to completely eliminate export taxes on agricultural products, confirmed by official government communications or reported by at least two reputable international news outlets (such as Reuters, Bloomberg, or Associated Press).

(a) Central Bank of Mexico announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: The Central Bank of Mexico (Banxico) has been maintaining a relatively high interest rate to combat inflation. As of June 2023, the interest rate was 11.25%. However, there are several factors that could lead to a rate cut by August 2024: 1. Global economic trends: If major economies like the US start cutting rates, Mexico might follow suit to remain competitive. 2. Inflation control: If inflation in Mexico shows consistent signs of cooling down, it could prompt a rate cut. 3. Economic growth concerns: If Mexico's economic growth slows, the central bank might cut rates to stimulate the economy. However, Banxico is known for its cautious approach, and rate cuts typically occur gradually. Given the high starting point and the relatively short timeframe (about 14 months from now to August 2024), a rate cut is possible but not highly probable. (b) Microsoft laying off fewer than 1,800 employees by July 2024: Microsoft announced an AI-focused reorganization plan in 2023, which often involves some level of restructuring and potential layoffs. However, several factors suggest that large-scale layoffs might be less likely: 1. AI focus: The reorganization is focused on AI, which is a growing field. This might involve more reallocation of resources rather than significant cuts. 2. Microsoft's strong financial position: The company has been performing well, which reduces the need for cost-cutting measures. 3. Talent retention: In the competitive tech industry, Microsoft might be cautious about large layoffs to retain talent, especially in AI-related roles. However, tech companies are known for periodic restructuring, and even if Microsoft doesn't announce a large layoff, smaller cuts over time could potentially add up to 1,800 or more. Considering both events together: For the question to resolve as YES, both events need to occur. This means the probability will be the product of the individual probabilities, which will be lower than either individual probability.

Location specificity: The question requires the announcement to be made specifically in Portland, Oregon. While Portland is a significant city, it's not typically a key location for major political announcements of this nature. 4. Time frame: The window for this event to occur is relatively short (July to August 2024), which further reduces the likelihood. 5. Unusual scenario: For this to happen, there would need to be a dramatic shift in the political landscape, such as Biden suddenly deciding not to run or stepping down, and Harris quickly launching a campaign. 6. Campaign strategy: Even if Harris were to run, announcing a running mate so early in the campaign (before primaries) would be an unusual strategy. Given these factors, the probability of this specific event occurring is extremely low.

States that are more likely to consider such measures are those with Democratic-controlled legislatures and governors, or those that have recently experienced high-profile gun violence incidents.

Given the ongoing debate about gun control in the United States, it's possible that more states might consider such measures. However, gun rights are a contentious issue, and many states are resistant to implementing stricter gun control laws. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for significant legislative changes in this area. Still, with increasing concerns about gun violence, there's a moderate chance that at least one additional state might implement such a measure. 2. New York referendum on abortion rights: New York already has strong protections for abortion rights. In 2019, the state passed the Reproductive Health Act, which codified Roe v. Wade protections into state law. Given this existing protection, there might be less urgency for a referendum specifically on this issue. However, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade at the federal level in 2022, there has been increased activity at the state level to protect abortion rights. Some states have held referendums to enshrine these rights in their constitutions. While New York hasn't announced such plans, the political climate could potentially lead to such a move to further solidify these protections. Considering both scenarios, there's a moderate chance of at least one of these events occurring by August 2024. The gun control measure seems slightly more likely given the ongoing national conversation about gun violence, but both are possible.

Since then, HDFC Bank has worked on improving its systems and compliance. The Indian banking sector is known for its strict regulations, and RBI often takes proactive measures to maintain stability.

The Bank of Israel has been raising rates to combat inflation. However, by August 2024, more than a year from now, the economic situation could change significantly.

(b) Reserve Bank of India imposing new regulatory curbs on HDFC Bank's lending: HDFC Bank is one of India's largest private sector banks. While it's not uncommon for the RBI to impose regulations on banks, targeting a specific bank with new curbs is less frequent.

In December 2020, the RBI temporarily halted HDFC Bank's digital launches and new credit card issuances due to technical glitches.

UAW endorsement by July 2024: The United Auto Workers (UAW) has a history of endorsing candidates in major elections, including Senate races.

The UAW typically supports Democratic candidates, and with the Senate being closely contested, they have an incentive to make early endorsements to influence the race.

No reports of TikTok's AI spreading election misinformation by August 2024: This condition is more challenging to predict. TikTok has been under scrutiny for its content moderation practices and potential for spreading misinformation. However, the company has been making efforts to improve its policies and AI systems to combat misinformation. The specific requirement of AI-driven content recommendations being reported for spreading election misinformation sets a high bar. While general concerns about misinformation on TikTok might arise, linking it specifically to AI-driven recommendations and having credible reports from multiple authoritative sources is less likely.

Central Bank of Mexico announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024: The Central Bank of Mexico (Banxico) has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation. As of June 2023, the interest rate stands at 11.25%. While there's a global trend towards easing monetary policy as inflation pressures subside, emerging markets like Mexico often lag behind developed economies in cutting rates. However, by July 2024, there's a reasonable chance that inflationary pressures will have eased sufficiently for Banxico to consider a rate cut. The timeline of over a year provides ample opportunity for economic conditions to change. Still, this is not a certainty, and much depends on global economic conditions and domestic inflationary trends. 2. Microsoft laying off fewer than 1,800 employees as part of its AI-focused reorganization: Microsoft has been undergoing significant restructuring, particularly in its AI divisions. In May 2023, the company laid off 1,900 employees from Activision Blizzard and Xbox divisions. However, these were not explicitly linked to the AI-focused reorganization mentioned in the question. The specificity of the 1,800 employee threshold suggests there might be some information or rumors about potential layoffs of this magnitude. That said, large tech companies often go through cycles of hiring and layoffs, and it's difficult to predict with certainty what Microsoft's staffing needs will be by July 2024, especially in the rapidly evolving field of AI.

For the interest rate cut, given the timeline and global economic trends, I'd estimate a probability of about 60% that Banxico will announce a rate cut by July 2024.

Given the company's size and the rapid changes in the tech industry, especially in AI, there's a significant chance they might need to restructure.

Let's analyze each part separately: 1. Microsoft laying off at least 1,800 employees: Microsoft has been undergoing significant restructuring as it focuses more on AI. In January 2023, Microsoft announced 10,000 layoffs, and in July 2023, they cut an additional 1,900 jobs from their gaming division. Given this recent history and the ongoing AI-focused reorganization, it's quite possible that Microsoft could announce another round of layoffs by July 2024. The tech industry, in general, has been experiencing layoffs, and as companies pivot towards AI, restructuring is common. However, the specific number (1,800) and the requirement for it to be linked to the AI reorganization plan make this somewhat less certain. 2. Central Bank of Mexico announcing an interest rate cut: As of June 2023, Mexico's central bank rate was at 11.25%, which is relatively high. Central banks typically cut rates when inflation is under control and they want to stimulate economic growth. Mexico's inflation rate has been declining, reaching 4.42% in May 2023, down from over 8% in 2022. If this trend continues, there's a good chance the Central Bank of Mexico might consider cutting rates by July 2024 to support economic growth. However, central banks are often cautious and may wait to ensure inflation is firmly under control before cutting rates. Considering both events, we have two separate possibilities for the question to resolve as YES, which increases the overall probability. The Microsoft layoffs seem somewhat likely given the company's recent history and ongoing AI focus, while the interest rate cut by Mexico's central bank is also plausible given the declining inflation trend.

Turkey's history of media censorship: Turkey has a track record of imposing restrictions on media freedom. The government has previously shut down social media platforms and arrested journalists, which has led to protests in the past. 2. Current political climate: President Erdogan's government has been known for its authoritarian tendencies and has faced criticism for limiting press freedom. Any further tightening of media censorship laws could potentially spark public outrage. 3. Recent protests in Turkey: In recent years, Turkey has seen significant protests on various issues, including the 2013 Gezi Park protests and demonstrations against the withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention in 2021. This indicates a willingness among the Turkish population to engage in large-scale protests. 4. Time frame: The question specifies a period of about one month (from the creation date to the resolution date).

Part A: Large protests in Turkey in response to media censorship law changes by July 2024. Turkey has a history of protests against government policies, including those related to media freedom. However, several factors make large-scale protests less likely: 1. The current government under President Erdogan has been in power for a long time and has gradually tightened control over media and public dissent. 2. Turkey already has strict media laws, so changes might not be drastic enough to trigger large protests. 3. The timeframe is relatively short (about a month), which limits the likelihood of such specific protests occurring. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of this part occurring at around 20%. Part B: Azerbaijan becoming a member of the BRICS alliance by August 2024. Several factors influence this possibility: 1. Azerbaijan has shown interest in joining BRICS, with President Aliyev expressing this desire in July 2023. 2. BRICS is expanding, with six new members (including Iran) set to join in January 2024. 3. Azerbaijan's strategic location and energy resources make it an attractive potential member. 4. However, the BRICS expansion process is typically slow, and the alliance might want to consolidate its recent expansion before adding more members. 5. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for completing the entire membership process. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Azerbaijan joining BRICS by August 2024 at around 30%.

However, this is a contentious issue with strong economic and geopolitical implications. The timeline for resumption (by July 2024) is relatively short, which reduces the likelihood of a policy reversal. However, factors such as energy security concerns, pressure from the industry, and potential changes in political landscape (2024 being an election year) could influence this decision. Given these factors, I'd estimate a moderate probability of about 40% for this event occurring. b) Major Chinese battery company beginning construction of a factory in Ohio by August 2024: There has been increasing interest from Chinese battery manufacturers in establishing production facilities in the U.S. to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market and to navigate trade tensions. However, several factors complicate this scenario: 1. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China have been high, potentially making such investments challenging. 2. There have been concerns in the U.S. about Chinese companies' involvement in critical industries. 3. The timeline (by August 2024) is relatively short for planning and initiating such a major project. 4.

As of early 2024, inflation remains above the ECB's 2% target. 2. Inflation outlook: While inflation has been declining, it's still not at the target level. The ECB will likely want to see a sustained period of inflation at or near its target before considering rate cuts. 3.

The primary obstacle is the current high inflation environment and the ECB's commitment to price stability. While economic weakness could push for easier monetary policy, the ECB is likely to prioritize inflation control.

I'd estimate this probability at around 90%. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.90 = 0.54 or 54%.

Mario Draghi remaining as President of the Italian Republic through July 2024: Mario Draghi is currently not the President of the Italian Republic. The current President is Sergio Mattarella, who was re-elected in January 2022 for a seven-year term. Draghi served as Prime Minister from February 2021 to October 2022, but he has never been President. For Draghi to become President by July 2024, Mattarella would need to resign, and Draghi would need to be elected by the Italian Parliament. Given that Mattarella's term extends well beyond 2024 and there are no indications of his intention to resign, the probability of this part is extremely low, close to zero. 2. Central Bank of Russia announcing a ruble stabilization program by August 2024: The Russian economy has been under significant pressure due to international sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. The ruble has experienced volatility, and the Central Bank of Russia has already implemented various measures to stabilize the currency. However, the need for a new, officially announced stabilization program by August 2024 is uncertain. Several factors to consider: a) The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and its unpredictable nature. b) The possibility of changes in international relations and sanctions. c) The adaptability of the Russian economy to current conditions. d) The effectiveness of current measures taken by the Central Bank of Russia. Given these factors, there is a moderate possibility that the Central Bank of Russia might announce a new stabilization program if economic conditions worsen or if there are significant geopolitical changes. However, it's not highly likely given the current trajectory and the bank's ongoing efforts. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Since the probability of Draghi becoming President is nearly zero, the overall probability is essentially determined by the likelihood of the Russian Central Bank announcing a ruble stabilization program.

Recent legislative trends: In 2023, Florida passed a law allowing permitless carry of concealed firearms, which indicates a trend towards less restriction on weapons, not more. 3. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of August 2024, which is relatively soon. Legislation often takes time to draft, debate, and pass, especially on potentially controversial topics. 4. Focus on non-firearm weapons: While there has been significant national debate about firearm legislation, there has been less focus on non-firearm weapons at the state level. 5. Lack of current public pressure: There doesn't seem to be a strong public push for such legislation in Florida at the moment, which would typically be a driving force for new restrictions. 6. Constitutional considerations: Any new restrictions would need to be carefully crafted to avoid potential legal challenges based on the Second Amendment or state constitutional protections. 7. Precedent in other states: While some states have enacted restrictions on specific non-firearm weapons (like switchblades or brass knuckles), comprehensive legislation on all non-firearm weapons is less common.

(a) Wisconsin: Wisconsin has a history of conservative politics and has previously enacted strict abortion regulations. However, the current political landscape in Wisconsin is complex. The state has a Democratic governor, Tony Evers, who supports abortion rights, but the state legislature is controlled by Republicans. This divided government makes it challenging to pass new abortion regulations. Additionally, Wisconsin is currently grappling with an 1849 law that bans nearly all abortions, which was reinstated after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. There's ongoing legal debate about this law, which might take precedence over new regulations. Given these factors, while it's possible that Wisconsin could enact stricter abortion regulations by July 2024, it's not highly likely due to the political divide and the existing legal complications. (b) Florida: Florida currently has a 15-week abortion ban in place. However, there's significant pressure from conservative groups and lawmakers to further restrict abortion access. Governor Ron DeSantis has expressed support for stricter abortion laws. In April 2023, Florida passed a six-week abortion ban, which is set to take effect if the state's current 15-week ban is upheld by the state Supreme Court. This indicates a clear intention to change the current 15-week law.

Let's examine each part separately: a) Florida's abortion law remaining unchanged by August 2024: Florida's current 15-week abortion law has been controversial and faced legal challenges. However, with a conservative-leaning state government and Supreme Court, it's relatively likely that this law will remain in place. The timeframe (until August 2024) is not very long, which reduces the chances of significant legislative changes. Still, there's always a possibility of court decisions or new legislation that could alter the law. b) Wisconsin enacting stricter abortion regulations by July 2024: Wisconsin has a complex history with abortion laws. The state currently has a pre-Roe abortion ban on the books, but its enforcement is being challenged. The political landscape in Wisconsin is divided, with a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature. This division makes it less likely for new, stricter abortion regulations to be enacted, as the governor would likely veto such measures. Considering both scenarios: The Florida scenario seems more likely to occur, as it requires maintaining the status quo rather than enacting new legislation. The Wisconsin scenario appears less likely due to the state's political division and the shorter timeframe (July 2024 vs. August 2024 for Florida). Given that only one of these needs to occur for a YES resolution, and the Florida scenario has a reasonably high likelihood, I would estimate the overall probability to be moderately high."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0750939261482639, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) Reinstatement of EPA's Clean Power Plan by August 2024: The Clean Power Plan was a signature climate policy of the Obama administration, which was repealed during the Trump administration. The Biden administration has shown a strong commitment to climate action, but reinstating the exact Clean Power Plan might be challenging due to several factors: 1. Legal hurdles: The original plan faced legal challenges, and a new version would likely face similar opposition. 2. Evolving energy landscape: The energy sector has changed significantly since the original plan, potentially necessitating updates. 3.

While this is a significant number, it's still well below the 720,000 threshold mentioned in the question.

However, $500 million is a significant amount for a single company. While the government has been supportive of EV initiatives, such large grants are not common. Additionally, the timeframe is relatively short (about a month from the creation date to the resolution date), which makes it less likely for such a large grant to be approved and announced within this period. b) United Auto Workers endorsing Elizabeth Warren for president: Elizabeth Warren is not currently a declared candidate for the 2024 presidential election. While she has been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, she has not indicated any plans to run for president in 2024. The UAW typically endorses Democratic candidates, but they usually wait until the party's nominee is clear or at least until the primary season is well underway. Given that the resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is before the typical time for presidential nominations, it's highly unlikely that the UAW would make an endorsement for Warren, especially if she's not even in the race. Considering both scenarios, the probability of either occurring is quite low. The Stellantis grant scenario is more plausible than the UAW endorsement, but still unlikely given the short timeframe and the large amount involved.

(b) WHO maintaining or escalating the global emergency status of the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa: Rift Valley fever is a serious disease that can affect both animals and humans. Outbreaks in East Africa are not uncommon, but they don't always reach global emergency status. The fact that this scenario assumes there's already a global emergency status for the outbreak is significant. Given that the WHO has already declared it a global emergency, it's more likely that they would maintain this status or potentially escalate it, rather than downgrade it within a relatively short timeframe (about 14 months from the question's creation date to the resolution date). The WHO tends to be cautious about downgrading emergency statuses too quickly. Let's estimate the probability of the WHO maintaining or escalating the emergency status at around 80%.

Hang Seng Index reaching 30,000 points by August 2024: The Hang Seng Index has been struggling in recent years due to various factors: - China's economic slowdown and regulatory crackdowns have affected investor sentiment. - Global economic uncertainties and US-China tensions have impacted Hong Kong's market. - As of June 2023, the index is trading around 19,000 points, far from the 30,000 target. To reach 30,000 points, the index would need to increase by about 58% in just over a year. While not impossible, this is a significant challenge given the current economic climate and geopolitical tensions. Combining these assessments: The question resolves as YES if either condition is met. Brazil avoiding a recession seems more likely than the Hang Seng Index reaching 30,000 points. The Brazilian economy's recent performance and policy direction suggest a moderate chance of avoiding recession. The Hang Seng Index, while having potential for growth, faces more significant hurdles to reach the specified target. Given that only one condition needs to be met for a YES resolution, and considering the higher likelihood of Brazil avoiding recession, I would estimate a moderately high probability for this question resolving as YES."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15636298703299828, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical inflation trends in Turkey: Turkey has been experiencing high inflation rates in recent years. In 2022, the annual inflation rate peaked at over 85%, and while it has come down since then, it remains relatively high. 2. Current economic situation: As of 2023, Turkey's economy is still facing challenges, including a weakening currency and high inflation rates. 3. Central Bank policies: The Central Bank of Turkey has been implementing various measures to combat inflation, including raising interest rates. However, these efforts have been inconsistent and sometimes contradictory to economic best practices. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period from October 2023 to July 2024, which is a relatively long time frame (10 months). This increases the likelihood of seeing at least one month with a significant increase in inflation. 5. Threshold: The question asks about a month-over-month increase exceeding 0.5%. This is a relatively low threshold, especially for a country with Turkey's recent inflation history. 6. Seasonal factors: Inflation can be affected by seasonal factors, such as increased consumer spending during holidays or fluctuations in food prices due to agricultural cycles. 7. External factors: Global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and commodity prices can influence Turkey's inflation rates. Given these factors, I believe there is a high probability that Turkey will experience at least one month with a month-over-month inflation increase exceeding 0.5% between October 2023 and July 2024. The long time frame, Turkey's recent history of high inflation, and the relatively low threshold of 0.5% all contribute to this assessment. However, it's important to note that the Central Bank and government are actively trying to reduce inflation, which could potentially lead to more stable month-over-month changes.

While there have been efforts to combat inflation, including recent interest rate hikes, the situation remains volatile. Given Turkey's history of high inflation and the long timeframe (from October 2023 to July 2024), it seems quite likely that there will be at least one month where inflation exceeds 0.5% month-over-month.

(b) German economy avoiding recession: Germany, Europe's largest economy, has been facing challenges including energy price pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the broader global economic slowdown. However, it has shown resilience in the face of these challenges. While there are concerns about Germany's economic performance, several factors work in favor of avoiding a recession: 1. The government has implemented measures to support the economy and mitigate energy price impacts. 2. Germany has a strong industrial base and export sector. 3.

(a) 30-year mortgage rate falling below 6.2%: As of June 2023, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate in the US is around 6.7%. For this condition to be met, rates would need to drop by at least 0.5 percentage points. This is certainly possible, given that the Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation. If inflation shows signs of cooling, the Fed might ease its monetary policy, leading to lower mortgage rates. However, this depends on various economic factors, including inflation trends, GDP growth, and overall economic stability. Given the current economic uncertainties, there's a moderate chance of this occurring by August 2024. (b) Weekly jobless claims not exceeding 200,000 for four consecutive weeks: As of June 2023, weekly jobless claims have been hovering around 230,000-260,000. For this condition to be met, the job market would need to remain very strong for over a year, with no significant economic downturns or major layoffs. While the US job market has shown resilience, maintaining such a low level of jobless claims for an extended period is challenging, especially given concerns about a potential recession. This condition seems less likely to be met than the first one. Combining both conditions: For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. This significantly reduces the probability, as we need both a decrease in mortgage rates and a consistently strong job market. These conditions can be somewhat at odds with each other, as lower interest rates are often associated with a weaker economy, which could lead to higher unemployment claims.

However, economic conditions can change rapidly. The Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation through interest rate hikes could potentially lead to a slowdown in the job market.

There's no indication that Gavin Newsom is planning to run for president in 2024. 2. Newsom's position: Gavin Newsom is currently the Governor of California and has not announced any intentions to run for president. He has publicly stated his support for Biden's re-election. 3. UAW's historical endorsements: The UAW typically endorses Democratic candidates, but they usually support the party's nominee or front-runner. In 2020, they endorsed Biden after he became the presumptive nominee. 4. Timeline: The question asks about an endorsement by July 2024, which is before the Democratic National Convention (usually held in August). It's unusual for major unions to endorse candidates other than the presumptive nominee this close to the convention. 5. UAW's priorities: The union is more likely to focus on endorsing a candidate with a strong chance of winning and who aligns with their labor-related interests, rather than making an unexpected endorsement. 6. Newsom's relationship with labor: While Newsom has generally good relations with labor unions in California, there's no particular indication that he has an exceptionally strong relationship with the UAW specifically. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the UAW would endorse Gavin Newsom for president by July 2024. For this to happen, several unlikely events would need to occur: 1. Newsom would need to decide to run for president. 2. Biden would need to drop out of the race or face a serious challenge. 3. Newsom would need to emerge as a front-runner in the Democratic primary. 4. The UAW would need to choose to endorse before the convention and pick Newsom over other potential candidates.

(a) California holding a referendum on abortion rights: California is known for being a progressive state with strong support for abortion rights. However, abortion rights are already protected in California, and the state constitution already guarantees the right to privacy, which has been interpreted to include abortion rights. There's no immediate threat to abortion rights in California that would necessitate a constitutional amendment. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex and costly process, typically reserved for highly contentious issues or significant changes. As of now, there are no widely reported plans for such a referendum in California by July 2024. Given these factors, the likelihood of this occurring seems low, perhaps around 10-15%. (b) United Auto Workers not endorsing Gavin Newsom for president: Gavin Newsom has not officially announced a run for president in 2024. The incumbent, Joe Biden, is likely to run for re-election, and unions typically support incumbent Democratic presidents. Even if Newsom were to run, he would be challenging an incumbent from his own party, which is unusual and often unsuccessful. The UAW typically endorses Democratic candidates, but they would be more likely to endorse Biden as the incumbent. If Newsom doesn't run (which is more likely), the UAW wouldn't endorse him by default. The probability of the UAW not endorsing Newsom (either because he's not running or because they endorse someone else) is quite high, perhaps around 90-95%. Combining these probabilities: For both conditions to be met, we need both events to occur. We multiply the probabilities: 0.15 (referendum) * 0.95 (no UAW endorsement) = 0.1425 or about 14.25%. This calculation assumes the events are independent, which is a reasonable assumption in this case.

Joe Biden is the incumbent Democratic president and is likely to run for re-election. The UAW typically endorses Democratic candidates, but they usually support the party's nominee rather than endorsing during primary contests.

Given that abortion rights are already enshrined in the state constitution, there is little need for another referendum on this issue by July 2024. However, political landscapes can change rapidly, and there's always a small possibility of unforeseen events leading to another referendum. Combining these factors: The likelihood of the UAW endorsing Newsom for president is extremely low, perhaps around 1%. The probability of California holding another abortion rights referendum by July 2024 is also low, given the recent constitutional amendment, but slightly higher than the UAW endorsement scenario.

Referendums on labor union laws are not common occurrences, especially at the state level. 2. There's no current indication or public discussion about Minnesota planning such a referendum. 3. The timeframe is relatively short (about a year from the question's creation date to the resolution date), which doesn't leave much time for organizing a statewide referendum. 4.

Work requirements for Medicaid have faced legal challenges in several states and have been struck down by federal courts. 2. The Biden administration has been generally opposed to Medicaid work requirements and has been rescinding approvals granted by the previous administration. 3. Even if Virginia manages to implement such a plan, enrolling 25,000 beneficiaries in a relatively short time frame could be challenging, especially given the controversies surrounding work requirements. 4.

In 2019, the state passed the Reproductive Health Act, which established abortion as a fundamental right. Given this existing strong protection, there might be less urgency for a referendum. However, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade and increased national focus on abortion rights, it's possible that Illinois might want to further solidify these protections through a referendum.

In fact, as of June 2023, there were reports that Skydance Media was in talks to merge with Paramount Global. While these talks haven't resulted in a deal yet, the fact that they're happening suggests there's genuine interest from both parties.

Current trends in higher education: Many top universities have been implementing policies to make education more accessible and affordable, especially for lower-income students. This trend suggests that such a move by Brown is not implausible. 2. Brown University's financial capacity: As an Ivy League institution, Brown has substantial financial resources, which could potentially support such an initiative. 3. Existing financial aid programs: Brown already has some financial aid programs in place for undergraduate students, which shows a commitment to accessibility. However, medical school programs often have different funding structures. 4. Timeframe: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is only about a month after the question was created. This extremely short timeframe makes it less likely for Brown to implement such a significant policy change if it hasn't already been in the works. 5. Lack of prior announcements: Given the short timeframe, if Brown was planning to implement this policy by July 2024, it's likely that there would have been some prior announcements or indications. The absence of such information in the question suggests this may not be imminent. 6. Specificity of the policy: The question specifies a particular income threshold ($100,000) and full tuition coverage. Universities often implement more gradual or flexible policies, which might not meet these exact criteria. 7. Competitive landscape: While some medical schools have implemented similar policies (e.g., NYU School of Medicine), it's still not a widespread practice, especially among Ivy League institutions. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Brown to implement such a policy, the extremely short timeframe and lack of prior indications make it quite unlikely. The specificity of the policy requirements also reduces the probability of an exact match."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "3e2439bb-9a6b-4d2d-89a8-20ad47ca8e14", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Medicare's negotiated drug prices include insulin by August 2024 and (b) Brown University does not fully cover tuition for medical students from lower-income families by July 2024?", "body": "(a) This part of the question will resolve as YES if the newly negotiated drug prices for Medicare, as mentioned in the Biden administration's announcement, include insulin and are confirmed to take effect by August 31, 2024.

(a) Medicare's negotiated drug prices including insulin by August 2024: The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022, allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time. The first set of negotiated prices is set to take effect in 2026, with the list of initial drugs announced in September 2023. Insulin, however, has been subject to separate provisions that took effect earlier. As of January 1, 2023, Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs for insulin have been capped at $35 per month. This suggests that insulin is already part of Medicare's cost reduction efforts, making it likely to be included in any further negotiations. Given the political importance of insulin prices, it's probable that insulin will be part of the negotiated drug prices by August 2024. I estimate this part has a high probability of resolving YES. (b) Brown University not fully covering tuition for medical students from lower-income families by July 2024: As of now, Brown University has not announced such a policy. While some medical schools have moved towards tuition-free models or increased financial aid for lower-income students, Brown has not been at the forefront of this trend. Implementing such a significant change in financial aid policy typically requires substantial planning and fundraising, which universities often announce well in advance. Given the lack of current information about Brown planning such a move and the relatively short timeframe until July 2024, it seems unlikely that Brown will implement this policy by the specified date. I estimate this part also has a high probability of resolving YES (meaning Brown will NOT fully cover tuition as specified). For the overall question to resolve YES, both parts need to resolve YES. Given that both parts seem likely to resolve YES individually, the overall probability is still relatively high.

The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for implementing such a major change. However, there is growing pressure on universities to address the high costs of medical education, so it's not entirely implausible. Probability for this part: ~10% 2. Medicare's negotiated drug prices including insulin: This part is more likely to occur. The Biden administration has been pushing for lower drug prices, and insulin has been a particular focus due to its high cost and essential nature for many Americans. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, already includes provisions for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and insulin price caps for Medicare recipients have been implemented.

This is a relatively long period for negotiations, which could increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement. 2. Importance of safety protocols: Safety is a critical issue in the railway industry, and both Union Pacific and the engineers' union have a vested interest in ensuring safe working conditions. This mutual interest could drive both parties towards an agreement. 3. Ongoing dispute: The question mentions an ongoing dispute, which suggests that there are already active negotiations or at least a recognized need for addressing safety protocols. This existing momentum could facilitate reaching an agreement. 4. Industry trends: In recent years, there has been an increased focus on safety in the transportation sector, including railways. This broader trend might put pressure on both parties to come to an agreement. 5. Potential economic and operational impacts: Prolonged disputes can lead to operational disruptions and economic losses for both the company and the workers. This could motivate both sides to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. 6. Union bargaining power: Train engineers are skilled workers, and their union likely has significant bargaining power, which could help push for an agreement addressing their safety concerns. 7. Public scrutiny: Railway safety is a matter of public interest, and media attention on the dispute could pressure both parties to reach an agreement. 8. Regulatory environment: Depending on the specific safety protocols in question, there might be regulatory pressures or guidelines that could influence the negotiations and push for an agreement. However, there are also factors that could hinder reaching an agreement: 1. Complexity of safety protocols: Depending on the specific issues, developing and agreeing on new safety protocols could be a complex and time-consuming process. 2. Potential costs: Implementing new safety measures might involve significant costs for Union Pacific, which could slow down the negotiation process. 3. Other bargaining issues: While the question focuses on safety protocols, there might be other issues in the dispute that could complicate reaching an overall agreement. 4. Possible unforeseen events: Over the 14-month period, unforeseen events (e.g., economic changes, leadership changes, accidents) could impact the negotiation process. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a good chance that an agreement will be reached within the given timeframe.

ALJs are generally subject to the ethics rules of their respective agencies and the broader federal government ethics regulations. 2.

This is a relatively short period for developing, approving, and implementing a new ethics code, especially considering the complexities of the U.S. federal government. 3.

As of now, there doesn't seem to be any major push or public discussion about implementing such a code.

The state has a Republican-controlled legislature, which might be inclined to pass stricter abortion laws. However, several factors make a total ban unlikely in the given timeframe: 1. The current 12-week ban is relatively recent, and there might not be an immediate push for further restrictions. 2. Total abortion bans are highly controversial and often face significant public and legal challenges. 3.

This means the company has already gone through a bankruptcy process and emerged successfully. 2. Time frame: The question is asking about July 2024, which is about three years after the company's previous emergence from bankruptcy. This is a significant amount of time for the company to have stabilized its operations and financial position. 3. Post-bankruptcy performance: Since emerging from bankruptcy in 2021, Frontier has been focusing on expanding its fiber network and improving its services. The company has been making progress in its fiber expansion plans, which could potentially improve its financial stability. 4. Industry trends: The telecommunications industry, particularly the broadband sector, has been seeing growth due to increased demand for high-speed internet services. This trend could benefit Frontier if they continue to expand their fiber network. 5. Economic conditions: While there have been economic challenges, including inflation and potential recession concerns, the demand for internet services remains strong, which could help support Frontier's business. 6. Lack of recent bankruptcy news: There have been no recent reports or indications that Frontier is considering filing for bankruptcy again. If the company was facing severe financial difficulties, it would likely be reported in financial news. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Frontier Communications would need to file for bankruptcy again by July 2024. The company has already gone through a restructuring process, and there are no apparent signs of severe financial distress that would necessitate another bankruptcy filing in the near future. However, we must also consider that unforeseen circumstances could arise, such as major regulatory changes, unexpected market shifts, or significant operational issues that could potentially lead to financial difficulties.

(a) U.S. previously occupied home sales increase for two consecutive quarters by July 2024: The U.S. housing market has been facing challenges due to high interest rates and inflation. However, there are signs that the market might be stabilizing: 1. The Federal Reserve has indicated it may start cutting interest rates in 2024, which could boost home sales. 2. Inflation is showing signs of cooling, which may improve consumer confidence. 3. There's pent-up demand from potential buyers who have been waiting for more favorable conditions.

The BOJ has already started to allow more flexibility in its yield curve control policy, indicating a potential shift away from ultra-loose policy. 3. Global economic conditions might improve by 2024, reducing the need for further stimulus. However, the BOJ is known for its cautious approach and might be reluctant to raise rates quickly.

As of now, there's no strong indication that they plan to cut rates further. In fact, there has been speculation about potential rate hikes due to rising inflation. However, global economic uncertainties and the BOJ's historical reluctance to tighten policy quickly mean a rate cut isn't entirely off the table.

Condition A: French President's Office announces conversion of additional vehicles to biofuel.

In recent years, there have been initiatives to convert official vehicles to biofuel. Given this trend and the relatively short timeframe (about a month), it seems quite likely that the French President's Office would make such an announcement. The condition specifies 'additional vehicles, beyond those already known,' which suggests an ongoing process. I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 70-80%. Condition B: Spain does not announce plans to build additional nuclear reactors beyond the current two. Spain has been phasing out nuclear power and focusing more on renewable energy sources. The country currently has two nuclear reactors planned, and there hasn't been significant public discussion or political momentum for expanding nuclear capacity beyond these. Given Spain's commitment to renewable energy and the general trend in Europe away from nuclear power, it seems unlikely that Spain would announce plans for additional reactors in the next month. The probability of Spain not announcing such plans (i.e., meeting this condition) is quite high, perhaps around 90-95%.

Central Bank of the Philippines interest rate cut: The Philippines, like many countries, is currently dealing with high inflation. As of June 2023, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation. However, by August 2024, more than a year from now, the economic situation could change significantly. If inflation starts to come under control, there might be room for an interest rate cut to stimulate economic growth. Given the uncertain global economic outlook and the potential for a slowdown, a rate cut by August 2024 is plausible but not certain. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. 2. Mexico's Senate passing a major economic reform bill opposed by President L\u00f3pez Obrador: President L\u00f3pez Obrador's term ends in September 2024, shortly after the resolution date of this question. As his presidency nears its end, there might be increased political maneuvering and potential for opposition parties to push through reforms. However, L\u00f3pez Obrador's party (MORENA) currently holds a majority in the Senate, making it challenging to pass bills he opposes. That said, political dynamics can shift, especially as a new election approaches. There's also the possibility of some senators breaking ranks on specific issues.

Historically, conservative states have been more likely to enact or maintain restrictions on transgender healthcare. 2. Existing legislation: Indiana already has restrictions on medical care for transgender youth. In April 2023, Indiana enacted a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, which took effect on July 1, 2023. This recent legislation suggests that the state is not inclined to loosen restrictions. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a change by July 2024, which is only about a year from the creation date of this question. Legislative processes can be slow, and significant policy changes often take longer than a year to materialize. 4. National trends: While some states have been moving to restrict transgender healthcare, there's also been pushback and legal challenges to such laws in various states. However, Indiana has not shown signs of reversing course on this issue. 5. Public opinion and activism: There might be ongoing activism and public pressure to modify the restrictions, but it's unclear if this has gained significant traction in Indiana. 6. Legal challenges: The existing law could face legal challenges, which might prompt legislative reconsideration. However, even if challenges are mounted, the legislative response within a year is not guaranteed. 7. Election cycle: 2024 is an election year, which could make lawmakers hesitant to tackle controversial issues like transgender healthcare. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Indiana will enact a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024.

The state has historically been anti-abortion, with some of the strictest abortion laws in the country. 2. Recent trends: There has been a nationwide trend of states holding referendums on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.

Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that typically requires significant lead time. 4. Existing laws: Arkansas already has a near-total abortion ban in place, which went into effect after the Roe v. Wade decision was overturned. This reduces the likelihood of a pro-choice referendum. 5. Citizen-led initiatives: Arkansas does allow for citizen-led ballot initiatives, but these require a significant number of signatures and must go through a rigorous approval process. 6. Lack of current momentum: As of now, there are no widely reported efforts or campaigns in Arkansas pushing for such a referendum. 7. Political risk: Given the conservative nature of the state, Republican lawmakers would be unlikely to support a referendum that could potentially enshrine abortion rights. 8.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Arkansas will hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024.

The Central Bank of Mexico's monetary policy decisions depend on various economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic conditions. As of June 2024, we don't have specific information about Mexico's economic situation or the central bank's stance. However, central banks generally adjust interest rates in response to economic conditions, and a rate cut within a two-month window is certainly possible.

However, this doesn't necessarily mean they will hold a referendum to enshrine these rights. 2. Existing laws: Washington already has strong protections for abortion rights. In 1991, voters passed Initiative 120, which codified Roe v. Wade into state law. This existing protection might reduce the urgency for a referendum. 3. Recent legislative actions: In 2022, Washington passed laws to further protect abortion rights and providers, including shielding them from out-of-state prosecutions. This recent action might decrease the likelihood of a referendum in the near future. 4. Timing: The question specifies a deadline of August 2024, which is just over a year away. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that typically requires significant lead time for planning, approval, and implementation. 5. National context: While there's been increased focus on abortion rights nationally since the overturning of Roe v.

No current announcements: As of now, there don't appear to be any official announcements or strong movements pushing for such a referendum in Washington. 7. Alternative methods: Given Washington's existing protections and recent legislative actions, it's more likely that any further strengthening of abortion rights would come through the legislative process rather than a public referendum.

However, abortion rights are already protected in Washington state law, which might reduce the urgency for a referendum. There's no current indication of a planned referendum on this issue in Washington. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for organizing a state-wide referendum if it's not already in the planning stages.

Many institutions have already removed the Sackler name from their buildings. 2. Arthur Sackler's specific role: Arthur Sackler died in 1987, before OxyContin was developed. He was not directly involved in the opioid crisis, which might make Harvard more hesitant to remove his name specifically. 3. Harvard's previous stance: As of now, Harvard has resisted calls to remove Arthur Sackler's name from its museum, stating that Arthur Sackler's donations were made before OxyContin was created. 4. Time frame: The question asks about a relatively short time frame (by August 2024), which gives Harvard limited time to change its stance and implement such a significant decision. 5. Precedent: Other prestigious institutions like Tufts University and the Louvre have removed the Sackler name, which could put pressure on Harvard. 6. Public opinion: There's ongoing public pressure to dissociate from the Sackler name, which could influence Harvard's decision. 7.

However, Arthur Sackler died in 1987, before OxyContin was developed, and his name has been somewhat less controversial than other family members. Harvard has resisted previous calls to remove his name, citing his contributions to the university before the opioid crisis. However, public pressure continues to mount, and universities are increasingly responsive to such concerns.

Given this existing legislation, it's less likely that Arkansas would pass an even stricter total ban by July 2024. The current law already meets most criteria for a 'total ban' as defined in the question.

The state currently has a Republican governor and a divided legislature, with Republicans controlling the House of Delegates and Democrats controlling the Senate. In recent years, there have been efforts from both sides to either restrict or protect abortion rights. However, holding a referendum on abortion rights would require significant political maneuvering and agreement between the divided government branches. Referendums in Virginia are not common and typically require a constitutional amendment process, which is lengthy and complex. It involves passing the proposed amendment through two separate legislative sessions with an election in between, followed by a referendum.

Combining these factors: The likelihood of Arkansas passing an even stricter abortion ban is low, given their already stringent laws.

This might create a need for banks to manage their loan portfolios more actively. 3. Regulatory environment: Banks are under increasing pressure to maintain strong capital ratios and manage risk. Issuing pass-through certificates can be a way to transfer risk and free up capital. 4. Time frame: The question allows for a period of about 14 months from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a reasonable timeframe for a large bank to plan and execute such a transaction. 5. Amount: $1 billion is a significant but not unreasonable amount for a large international bank like Barclays to issue in pass-through certificates. 6. Barclays' financial position: As of 2023, Barclays remains one of the largest banks in the UK and has a significant international presence. It has the capacity to undertake large financial transactions. 7. Economic conditions in India: If the certificates are to be issued in Indian Rupees, the economic conditions in India would be relevant. India's economy has been growing, which could create opportunities for such financial instruments. However, there are also factors that might decrease the likelihood: 1. Specific strategy: The question requires the issuance to be part of a strategy to manage the bank's loan portfolio or address funding gaps. This narrows the circumstances under which a qualifying issuance could occur. 2. Alternative strategies: Barclays might choose other methods to manage its loan portfolio or address funding gaps. 3. Market appetite: The success of such an issuance depends on market demand, which can be unpredictable. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of this event occurring. Barclays has the capacity and has shown willingness to engage in such transactions in the past. The timeframe is reasonable, and current market conditions might make such a move attractive. However, the specific requirements and the large amount involved do add some uncertainty."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "0ea60dc6-a5b5-4ef1-9caa-cff9c06c6907", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The U.S. economy avoids a recession by July 2024 (b) Barclays Bank issues pass-through certificates worth less than $1 billion by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if both of the following conditions are met: \n\n(a) By July 31, 2024, the U.S. economy does not enter a recession.

(a) U.S. economy avoiding a recession by July 2024: The U.S. economy has shown resilience despite high inflation and interest rate hikes. As of mid-2023, the labor market remains strong, and consumer spending is holding up. However, there are concerns about a potential recession due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary tightening. The inverted yield curve, a historically reliable recession indicator, has been present for some time. That said, many economists have been pushing back their recession predictions or reducing the likelihood of a recession occurring in the near term. Given the mixed signals and the relatively short timeframe (about a year from now), I'd estimate the probability of avoiding a recession by July 2024 at around 60%. (b) Barclays Bank issuing pass-through certificates worth less than $1 billion by August 2024: Pass-through certificates are typically used in securitization transactions, often in the context of mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities. Barclays, being a major global bank, is likely to engage in such transactions. However, the specific condition of issuing less than $1 billion worth of these certificates in the Indian market is quite specific. Without more context about Barclays' recent activities in this area or their strategic plans for the Indian market, it's difficult to make a precise estimate. Given that $1 billion is a relatively large amount for a single issuance, and considering the specificity of the condition, I'd estimate the probability of Barclays not issuing $1 billion or more in pass-through certificates by August 2024 at around 70%.

However, the specific requirement of $1 billion is a substantial amount, even for a bank of Barclays' size. Without recent precedent or announced plans, it's difficult to assign a high probability to this specific event.

However, there are concerns about a potential recession due to these factors. The Federal Reserve's actions to combat inflation could lead to an economic slowdown. That said, many economists believe that if a recession does occur, it might be mild. The labor market remains strong, and consumer spending has been robust. Additionally, the timeline for this condition extends to July 31, 2024, giving the economy more time to navigate challenges. Given these factors, we can estimate the probability of avoiding a recession by mid-2024 at around 60%. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs.

Political climate: Energy policies can be influenced by political factors, but major shifts typically take longer than a month to implement. 7. Environmental concerns: There's growing pressure to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, which might discourage new LNG import projects. Given these factors, it's important to note that the question is not about whether new LNG import projects will be approved, but whether the government will resume consideration of such projects. Since there's no current pause on import projects (unlike export projects), the government is likely already open to considering them if proposed. However, the lack of economic incentive for new LNG import projects in the U.S. makes it unlikely that there will be any significant announcements or changes in policy regarding LNG imports within the short timeframe. The question might be resolving as YES by default if the government is already technically open to considering LNG import projects, even if no new considerations are actively happening due to lack of proposals. The probability is relatively high because the government is likely already open to considering LNG import projects, and there's no known moratorium on such considerations.

The WHO typically maintains emergency status for some time after the peak of an outbreak to ensure proper monitoring and response.

Given that there's no current widespread issue with lead in paprika (as of June 2023), and assuming continued vigilance in food safety practices, it's more likely than not that there won't be a recall.

National trends: There has been increased attention and legislative action regarding transgender rights and healthcare across the United States, both in supportive and restrictive directions. This national focus could influence Colorado's legislative priorities. 5.

Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance that Colorado could enact a law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024. However, the lack of information about current restrictions and the absence of any specific proposed legislation creates uncertainty. The state's progressive leanings and the current political control by Democrats increase the likelihood of such a law being passed if it were proposed.

Colorado enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth: Colorado has been relatively progressive on LGBTQ+ issues, including transgender rights. However, as of now, there are no major restrictions on medical care for transgender youth in Colorado that would necessitate a new law to modify them. In fact, Colorado has been supportive of transgender rights, with laws protecting against discrimination and allowing minors to access gender-affirming care with parental consent. Without a pressing need to change existing policies, it seems unlikely that Colorado would enact a new law specifically modifying restrictions on this issue by July 2024. 2. New Jersey holding a referendum on abortion rights: New Jersey has strong abortion protections in place, with Governor Phil Murphy signing the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act in January 2022, which codified the right to abortion into state law. While there have been discussions about further enshrining these rights in the state constitution, no concrete plans for a referendum have been announced as of now. The process of getting a referendum on the ballot typically requires legislative action or a significant petition drive, which takes time to organize. Given that there's already strong legal protection for abortion rights in New Jersey, and no immediate threat to these rights, the urgency for a constitutional amendment may be perceived as low. However, with the ongoing national debate on abortion rights, it's not entirely implausible that New Jersey might decide to take this step to further solidify these protections. Considering both scenarios, it appears more likely that New Jersey might hold a referendum on abortion rights than Colorado enacting a new law on transgender youth medical care.

The state currently has a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, who is pro-choice. This could influence the legal and political landscape surrounding abortion rights. 3. Recent trends in abortion laws: Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, many states have enacted stricter abortion laws. However, several of these laws have faced legal challenges, with mixed results across different states. 4. Time frame: The question allows for about 10 months from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a relatively short period for a case to move through the court system, especially if it needs to go through multiple levels of appeal. 5. Pennsylvania state courts: The composition and historical rulings of Pennsylvania state courts would be crucial in determining the outcome. Without specific information about the current makeup of these courts, it's difficult to predict their likely ruling. 6. Public opinion: Public sentiment in Pennsylvania regarding abortion rights could influence the urgency and direction of court decisions, although courts are supposed to rule based on law rather than public opinion. 7. Precedent: The ruling would likely consider both state and federal precedents on abortion rights, including the recent changes at the federal level. Given these factors, it seems more likely that the ban would not be declared constitutional within the given timeframe. The existing block on the law, the potentially lengthy legal process, and the mixed political landscape in Pennsylvania all suggest that a clear constitutional declaration in favor of the ban is not highly probable by August 2024. However, the uncertainty is high due to the complex and rapidly changing nature of abortion law in the United States."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "73c5b640-5f31-474f-b188-04c8dcbacbf8", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) An enforceable ethics code for U.S. Supreme Court justices be established by July 2024 (b) Pennsylvania's near-total abortion ban not be declared constitutional by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) By July 31, 2024, an enforceable ethics code specifically for U.S. Supreme Court justices is officially adopted by the United States government.

(a) Establishing an enforceable ethics code for U.S. Supreme Court justices by July 2024: The issue of Supreme Court ethics has been a topic of discussion, especially given recent controversies involving some justices. However, implementing an enforceable ethics code faces significant challenges: 1. Separation of powers: The Supreme Court is an independent branch of government, and imposing external rules may be seen as infringing on its independence. 2.

There has been significant political pressure to address this issue. However, as of now, there is no concrete announcement or plan for such a referendum.

(a) Central Bank of Russia interest rate cut: The Russian economy has been under significant pressure due to international sanctions and geopolitical tensions. However, the Central Bank of Russia has been cautious with its monetary policy to combat inflation and maintain economic stability. As of now, there's no clear indication that the bank is planning to cut interest rates in the near future. The resolution date is about two months after the question's creation date, which is a relatively short time frame for significant economic policy changes. Given the current global economic uncertainties and Russia's specific challenges, it seems unlikely that the Central Bank would announce a rate cut within this timeframe. However, it's not impossible if economic conditions improve rapidly or if there's a strategic shift in policy. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. (b) Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. workers' strike: Labor disputes in the automotive industry are not uncommon, but major, prolonged strikes are relatively rare, especially for Japanese companies known for their strong labor-management relations. Nissan, like many automakers, has faced challenges in recent years, including supply chain disruptions and market pressures, which could potentially lead to labor tensions. However, for this condition to be met, either a significant strike must occur and remain unresolved, or no significant strike occurs at all. The latter scenario is more likely. Given the short time frame (about a month from the question's creation to the resolution date for this part), it's more probable that either no major strike will occur or if one does occur, it will be resolved quickly due to the high stakes for both the company and workers. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met (either no strike or an unresolved strike) at about 80%. To calculate the probability of both events occurring together, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.30 * 0.80 = 0.24 or 24%.

The criteria for the strike (1,000+ participants, lasting at least a week) are quite specific and would represent a significant event.

Given these factors, I believe it's more likely that the ban will not be declared constitutional by August 2024. The combination of the ongoing national debate, the complexity of the legal process, and the specific requirements for resolution make it less probable that all conditions will be met within the given timeframe.

(a) UAW endorsing a former secretary of state by July 2024: The most likely candidate fitting this description is Hillary Clinton, who served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. However, Clinton is not currently a candidate for the 2024 presidential election. The other potential candidate is John Kerry, who served as Secretary of State from 2013 to 2017, but he's also not running for president in 2024. The current frontrunner for the Democratic nomination is incumbent President Joe Biden, who has never been Secretary of State. His main challenger, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also doesn't fit this criteria. Given this information, it seems highly unlikely that the UAW would endorse a former secretary of state, simply because there isn't a viable candidate fitting that description. I would estimate the probability of this occurring at about 5%. (b) Arizona's near-total abortion ban not being declared constitutional by August 2024: Arizona's near-total abortion ban has been a contentious issue. The ban, which dates back to 1864, was blocked by a court injunction in 1973 following Roe v. Wade. After Roe was overturned in 2022, there has been legal uncertainty about the status of this law. Given the current political climate and the trend of court decisions on abortion rights since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it seems more likely than not that the ban will either be ruled unconstitutional or that no ruling will be made by August 2024. The legal process can be slow, and it's possible that the case might not be fully resolved by that date. I would estimate the probability of the ban not being declared constitutional by August 2024 at about 70%. Combining probabilities: For both conditions to be met, we need both events to occur. We multiply the probabilities: 0.05 * 0.70 = 0.035 or 3.5%.

Part A: Arizona's near-total abortion ban being declared constitutional by August 2024. Arizona has a history of conservative politics, which might favor upholding strict abortion laws. However, there's a growing trend of courts striking down or blocking strict abortion bans in various states following the Dobbs decision. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for a final court decision on such a contentious issue, especially if appeals are involved. The requirement for the ruling to come from an Arizona state court adds specificity but doesn't significantly change the likelihood. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of this part occurring to be around 30%. Part B: United Auto Workers endorsing a candidate who is a former secretary of state by July 2024. The most prominent former secretary of state who might run for president is Hillary Clinton, but she's unlikely to run in 2024. Other potential candidates who were former secretaries of state (e.g., Mike Pompeo) are not currently major contenders for the 2024 presidential race. The UAW typically endorses Democratic candidates, which further narrows the field of potential endorsees fitting this description.

Economic forecasts: Various international organizations, including the IMF and the European Commission, have projected slow but positive growth for Italy in 2023 and 2024.

For a strike to last from now until August 2024 would be highly unusual and economically damaging for both workers and companies. Norway's strong tradition of labor negotiations and the economic importance of the oil sector make such a prolonged strike unlikely. b) Italian economy entering a recession by July 2024: Italy's economy has been struggling with slow growth for years, and it's vulnerable to economic shocks.

New Mexico's child access prevention law: New Mexico currently has a child access prevention law for firearms. This law requires gun owners to keep firearms out of the reach of children. Given that this law is already in place and there's no significant public push or political movement to repeal it, it's highly likely that New Mexico will maintain this law through August 2024. Gun safety laws, especially those protecting children, are generally popular and difficult to repeal without substantial political pressure. 2. Maine's 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases: As of now, Maine does not have a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases. The state has some gun regulations, but a mandatory waiting period is not one of them. While there have been discussions about implementing waiting periods in various states, Maine has not shown strong indications of moving in this direction. Given the relatively short timeframe until August 2024 and the lack of current legislative momentum for such a change, it's unlikely that Maine will implement and maintain a 72-hour waiting period by the specified date. Both conditions seem likely to be met: a) New Mexico is likely to maintain its child access prevention law. b) Maine is unlikely to implement and maintain a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases. However, we must consider potential factors that could change this outlook: 1. Unforeseen events (such as high-profile gun incidents) could rapidly shift public opinion and lead to legislative changes. 2. Changes in political leadership or party control in either state could affect gun legislation. 3. National-level gun control initiatives could influence state-level policies. Given these considerations, while both conditions seem likely to be met, there is still some uncertainty, particularly regarding potential changes in Maine's gun laws."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "83a10cdb-feae-4f9d-990a-f33162d8494c", "title": "Will either Maine maintain its 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases or New Mexico maintain its child access prevention law for firearms through August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, as of August 31, 2024, either of the following conditions is met: (a) Maine continues to enforce a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases as part of its gun safety laws.

Let's analyze each part separately: 1. Maine's 72-hour waiting period: Maine implemented this waiting period recently (in 2023) as part of a package of gun safety measures. Given that it's a relatively new law and was passed in response to growing concerns about gun violence, it's likely to remain in place for at least a year. However, gun laws can be contentious, and there might be pressure from gun rights advocates to repeal or modify the law. The short time frame (about 14 months from the question's creation to resolution) works in favor of the law remaining unchanged. 2. New Mexico's child access prevention law: Child access prevention laws are generally less controversial than other gun control measures, as they focus on child safety rather than restricting gun ownership. New Mexico has had this law in place for some time, and there doesn't seem to be significant pressure to repeal it. The focus on child safety makes it politically difficult to oppose. Considering both parts: - The question resolves as YES if either condition is met, which increases the likelihood of a YES resolution. - Both laws are relatively recent and address significant public safety concerns, making them less likely to be repealed in the short term. - The time frame is relatively short (about 14 months), which reduces the likelihood of significant legislative changes. - Gun laws can be politically volatile, but child safety laws tend to have broader support. Given these factors, I believe it's highly likely that at least one of these laws will remain in place through August 2024. The child access prevention law in New Mexico seems particularly likely to persist. While there's always a possibility of unexpected political shifts or legal challenges, the combination of two separate conditions and the short time frame makes a YES resolution quite probable."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.577546122578921, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.19251537419297368, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 1.1261972209090712, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Federal Reserve policy: The Fed has been aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation. While they may slow down or pause rate hikes, it's unlikely they will significantly lower rates by August 2024, given persistent inflation concerns. 3. Economic outlook: The U.S. economy has shown resilience despite high interest rates, which could support continued higher mortgage rates. 4. Inflation trends: While inflation has moderated from its peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% target. Continued inflationary pressures could keep mortgage rates elevated. 5. Historical context: Mortgage rates have been historically low in recent years. A return to more \"normal\" levels could keep rates above 5.5%. 6. Time frame: The question asks about rates at any point during August 2024, which is over a year away.

Bank of Canada (BoC) interest rate reduction: The BoC has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation. As of June 2023, the BoC's key interest rate is at 4.75%, which is historically high. Economic indicators and inflation trends will play a crucial role in the BoC's decision. The timeline (by August 2024) gives about 14 months for economic conditions to change. Many economists predict that central banks, including the BoC, might start easing monetary policy in late 2023 or early 2024 if inflation continues to cool. 2. 15-year mortgage rate not exceeding 5.5%: Mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including the BoC's key interest rate, bond yields, and overall economic conditions. As of June 2023, 15-year fixed mortgage rates in Canada are generally below 5.5%. If the BoC reduces its key rate, it's likely to have a downward pressure on mortgage rates. However, other economic factors could potentially push rates higher. Considering these factors: There's a reasonable chance that the BoC will reduce rates by August 2024, especially if inflation continues to moderate. I'd estimate this probability at around 70%. The condition for the 15-year mortgage rate not exceeding 5.5% is also fairly likely, especially if the BoC reduces rates. I'd estimate this probability at around 75%. However, for the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. We need to multiply these probabilities: 0.70 * 0.75 = 0.525.

For this part to resolve as YES, rates would need to remain above 5.5% for more than a year. Given the current economic climate, with high inflation and the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat it, it's quite possible that mortgage rates will remain elevated.
