Historical context: Several states have attempted to implement work requirements for Medicaid in recent years, but most have been blocked by legal challenges or the Biden administration. 2. Current political climate: The Biden administration has been generally opposed to such requirements, making it less likely for states to pursue them. 3. Georgia's case: Georgia is currently the only state with an approved work requirement plan, which might encourage other conservative states to follow suit. 4. Time frame: The period until August 2024 allows for potential political shifts, especially considering the upcoming 2024 elections.

Federal Reserve actions: Continued interest rate hikes to combat inflation could slow economic growth and potentially increase unemployment. 4. Time frame: The longer time frame (until August 2024) increases the likelihood of economic fluctuations. This scenario is more likely than (a), as economic conditions can change rapidly, and a sustained period of higher jobless claims is possible within the given timeframe. Considering both scenarios, there's a moderate chance of at least one of these events occurring.

(a) Google's AI assistant spreading election misinformation: The timeframe is relatively short (by August 31, 2024), which limits the potential for such an incident to occur and be reported. Google has significant experience in managing information during elections and is likely to be cautious with its AI assistant. However, AI technology is rapidly evolving, and there's always a risk of unintended consequences or biases in AI systems. The 2024 US Presidential election will occur during this period, increasing scrutiny on tech platforms and their AI systems. The criteria for credible reports are quite specific, which may make it less likely to meet the exact requirements. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of part (a) occurring at around 20%. (b) CMA announcing completion of a digital advertising practices investigation: The CMA has been increasingly active in investigating digital markets and advertising practices. The timeframe (by July 31, 2024) is over a year away, giving ample time for an investigation to be conducted and completed. The requirement of involving at least five major companies makes it more challenging but not impossible. The CMA has shown interest in digital advertising before, making such an investigation plausible. The criteria for confirmation are less stringent than part (a), making it easier to meet the requirements. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of part (b) occurring at around 40%.

Likelihood of Harris running for President: For Harris to announce a running mate, she would need to be running for President herself. This would only happen if Biden decided not to run for re-election or if he were to step down as the nominee. While there has been speculation about Biden's age and fitness for office, he has consistently stated his intention to run for re-election. 3. Timing: The question specifies 'by August 2024.'

Historical context: California has a history of using ballot initiatives and referendums to address various issues, including gun control. However, gun control measures are often controversial and face significant opposition. 2. Current political climate: California is generally known for its progressive stance on gun control. The state already has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States, which might reduce the urgency for a new referendum. 3. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of August 31, 2024, which is about 14 months from the creation date of this question (June 30, 2023). This is a relatively short time frame to organize a statewide referendum, considering the process of drafting legislation, gathering signatures, and scheduling the vote. 4. Legislative process: In California, to get a referendum on the ballot, proponents typically need to gather a significant number of signatures (usually 5% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election for statutes, or 8% for constitutional amendments). This process can be time-consuming and expensive. 5. Existing gun control efforts: California lawmakers have been actively proposing and passing gun control legislation through the normal legislative process. This might reduce the likelihood of resorting to a referendum. 6. Public opinion: While California generally supports stricter gun control, there isn't a clear indication of overwhelming public demand for a specific referendum on this issue at this time. 7. Competing issues: Other pressing matters such as housing, climate change, and economic concerns might take precedence over gun control in terms of public attention and political will. 8. Potential legal challenges: Any proposed gun control referendum might face legal challenges, which could delay or prevent it from reaching the ballot. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for California to hold a gun control referendum by August 2024, it seems unlikely.

Kamala Harris is currently the Vice President and is expected to run alongside President Joe Biden for re-election in 2024. 2. There have been no indications of Harris running separately from Biden. 3. Even if she were to run independently, the timing (by August 2024) is very early for a VP pick announcement, as these typically happen closer to the party conventions. 4.

The state's constitution implicitly protects abortion rights through its right to privacy, and there are numerous laws safeguarding access to abortion. 2. Political climate: California is a predominantly Democratic state with a strong pro-choice stance. The state government, including Governor Gavin Newsom, has been vocal about protecting and expanding abortion rights, especially in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. 3. Recent legislative actions: In 2022, California passed Proposition 1, which explicitly added abortion rights to the state constitution. This amendment was approved by voters in November 2022. 4. Timeframe: The question asks about a referendum by July 2024, which is just about a year away from the current date. 5. Necessity of further action: Given that California has already enshrined abortion rights in its constitution through Proposition 1 in 2022, there is little immediate need for another referendum on the same issue. 6.

Additionally, holding a statewide referendum on such a complex issue as healthcare access is a significant undertaking that typically requires extensive planning and political will.

The Republican Party generally supports stricter abortion regulations. 3. Existing restrictions: Given that Arkansas already has very restrictive abortion laws in place, including a near-total ban triggered by the Dobbs decision, there might be less urgency to pass additional legislation. 4. Time frame: The question asks about passage by July 2024, which is about a year away. This provides ample time for legislation to be introduced and passed if there is political will. 5. Public opinion: While Arkansas is a conservative state, extreme abortion bans can sometimes face public backlash, which might make some legislators hesitant. 6. Legal challenges: Any total abortion ban would likely face immediate legal challenges, which might make some lawmakers cautious about passing such legislation. 7.

National trends: There is a growing national discussion about free community college, with some states implementing such programs. However, most of these states tend to be more politically liberal than South Carolina. 6. Economic considerations: Implementing a free community college program would require significant state funding, which might be challenging given other budget priorities and potential economic uncertainties. 7.

Many tech companies are under pressure to reduce their carbon footprint, and AI energy consumption is a key area of focus.

Industry trends: Other major tech companies have also been conducting layoffs. If this trend continues or intensifies, Google might follow suit. 4. Time frame: The question gives a relatively long time frame (until August 2024), which increases the possibility of additional layoffs being announced. 5. Previous layoff patterns: Companies often conduct layoffs in phases. The initial 8% reduction might be followed by further cuts if deemed necessary. 6. Technological advancements: Rapid advancements in AI and automation might lead to restructuring and potential job cuts in certain areas. 7. Market competition: Increased competition in key markets might force Google to streamline operations further. However, there are also factors that might reduce the likelihood of additional layoffs: 1. Recovery potential: The tech industry might recover, reducing the need for further cuts. 2. Public perception: Additional layoffs could negatively impact Google's image and employee morale. 3. Talent retention: Google might want to avoid losing more talent in a competitive job market. 4.

US government incentives: The Inflation Reduction Act provides significant incentives for domestic battery production, which could motivate South Korean companies to build in the US. 7. Potential obstacles: Factors like permitting processes, local negotiations, or global economic conditions could delay construction. Given these considerations: - The EV market growth and US government incentives make it likely that South Korean battery companies would want to expand in the US. - Michigan is a logical location for such expansion. - However, the extremely short timeframe (2 months) between the question's creation and the resolution date is a significant constraint. - Major construction projects typically require longer lead times for planning, permitting, and preparation.

The company has been focusing on cost-cutting measures and improving efficiency. However, the tech industry remains volatile, and economic uncertainties persist. Google's parent company, Alphabet, might face pressure to further streamline operations if economic conditions worsen or if there's increased competition in the AI space.

There's a growing trend of battery manufacturers setting up factories in the US, driven by the Inflation Reduction Act's incentives for domestic EV battery production. Michigan, with its strong automotive industry presence, is an attractive location for such facilities. South Korean companies like LG Energy Solution, SK On, and Samsung SDI are actively expanding their presence in the US EV battery market. In fact, there have already been announcements and plans for battery factories in Michigan by some of these companies.

Recent abortion legislation: In 2019, Georgia passed a 'heartbeat bill' restricting abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, which was later blocked by federal courts. This indicates a tendency towards restricting rather than protecting abortion rights. 3. Referendum process in Georgia: Georgia does not have a process for citizen-initiated referendums.

Current issues: Union Pacific, like many railroad companies, has faced criticism for schedule unpredictability, which affects both freight and passenger services. This suggests there might be pressure to improve their scheduling systems. 3. Focus on passenger services: The question specifically asks about a system for passenger train services. Union Pacific primarily operates freight trains, with Amtrak using their tracks for passenger services. This makes it less likely that Union Pacific would prioritize a passenger-specific scheduling system. 4. Industry trends: There's a growing emphasis on improving efficiency and predictability in the railroad industry, which could motivate Union Pacific to implement new systems. 5. Technology advancements: Advancements in AI and machine learning are making it easier to implement more sophisticated scheduling systems, which could increase the likelihood of implementation. 6. Regulatory pressure: If there's increased regulatory pressure to improve passenger train services, Union Pacific might be more inclined to implement such a system. 7. Public relations: Implementing a system to improve passenger train schedules could be a positive PR move for Union Pacific, potentially motivating them to take action. 8.

Therefore, it's more likely that any scheduling changes would be focused on freight operations, including train engineers in Texas. 4. Texas operations: Texas is a significant state for Union Pacific's operations, with major freight corridors. Improvements in this region could have a substantial impact on the company's overall efficiency. 5. Recent labor issues: The railroad industry, including Union Pacific, has faced labor disputes and concerns about unpredictable schedules. This increases the likelihood of implementing new scheduling systems to address these issues. 6.

Current political landscape: Rishi Sunak is a Conservative Prime Minister, and while the House of Lords is not elected, it does have a significant number of Conservative peers. This makes it less likely for the Lords to pass a bill that Sunak strongly opposes. 3. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 14 months (from now until August 2024). This is a relatively short time for a major economic reform bill to be proposed, debated, and passed, especially if it's controversial. 4. Economic context: The UK is currently facing economic challenges, including high inflation and slow growth. This could potentially lead to debates about economic reform, but major changes are often slow to implement. 5. Parliamentary procedures: For a bill to reach the House of Lords, it typically needs to originate in the House of Commons. Given the Conservative majority in the Commons, it's unlikely that a bill strongly opposed by Sunak would make it to the Lords in the first place. 6. Historical precedent: It's rare for the House of Lords to pass major economic legislation that is explicitly opposed by the sitting government. The Lords are more likely to suggest amendments rather than pass bills outright against the government's wishes. 7. Upcoming general election: There must be a general election by January 2025 at the latest. As we approach this date, it becomes less likely for major economic reforms to be pushed through, as the focus shifts to campaigning. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the House of Lords would pass a major economic reform bill opposed by Prime Minister Sunak by August 2024.

Current state of unionization: In June 2022, employees at an Apple store in Towson, Maryland, became the first to unionize in the US. This shows that unionization efforts are underway within Apple's retail workforce. 2. Ohio unionization efforts: In October 2022, workers at an Apple store in Columbus, Ohio, voted to unionize, becoming the second Apple store in the US to do so. This indicates that there is a specific union presence in Ohio that could push for a contract. 3. Apple's stance: Historically, Apple has been resistant to unionization efforts. The company has been accused of anti-union tactics, which suggests they may not be eager to finalize a contract quickly. 4. Timeframe: The question gives approximately one year from the creation date to the resolution date. Negotiating and finalizing a first union contract can often take longer than a year, especially if the company is resistant. 5. Precedent: As of June 2023, Apple has not finalized a union contract with any of its unionized stores in the US. This suggests that the process is moving slowly across all locations. 6. Legal and regulatory environment: The National Labor Relations Board has been more pro-union under the Biden administration, which could put pressure on Apple to negotiate in good faith. 7. Public and investor pressure: As a high-profile company, Apple may face pressure from consumers and investors to resolve labor disputes, which could expedite the process. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Apple will finalize a union contract with Ohio store employees by July 2024. The company's historical resistance to unions, the lack of precedent for such contracts within Apple, and the typically lengthy process of negotiating first contracts all suggest a low probability of success within the given timeframe.

UK House of Lords passing a major economic reform bill opposed by PM Sunak: The UK House of Lords has the power to scrutinize and amend legislation, but it rarely outright opposes the government's agenda, especially on major economic issues. The House of Lords is generally more cautious about challenging the elected government on significant policy matters. Additionally, PM Sunak's Conservative Party currently holds a majority in the House of Commons, which would make it difficult for the Lords to pass legislation explicitly opposed by the government. However, given the current economic challenges in the UK and potential disagreements over policy, there's a small chance this could happen.

Current status of the outbreak: As of now (June 2024), there is an ongoing Nipah virus outbreak that has prompted heightened public health responses globally. This suggests the outbreak is significant enough to warrant international attention. 2. Typical duration of Nipah virus outbreaks: Historical data shows that Nipah virus outbreaks tend to be relatively short-lived, usually lasting a few weeks to a couple of months. However, the global nature of this outbreak might extend its duration. 3. Time frame: We have approximately two months (July and August 2024) for the WHO to declare the outbreak over. 4. WHO's declaration process: The WHO typically declares an outbreak over after a period of time has passed with no new cases. For Nipah virus, this period is usually twice the incubation period, which is 4-14 days. So, we might expect the WHO to wait at least 28 days after the last reported case before declaring the outbreak over. 5. Global response: Given the heightened public health responses, it's likely that significant resources are being devoted to containing the outbreak, which could help in controlling it more quickly. 6. Nipah virus characteristics: The virus has a high mortality rate but limited human-to-human transmission, which can help in containing outbreaks more effectively than highly transmissible diseases. Considering these factors, there's a reasonable chance that the outbreak could be contained within the next two months. However, the global nature of the outbreak and the possibility of new cases emerging in different regions could potentially extend the duration beyond August 2024. Given the typically short duration of Nipah outbreaks and the likely intense global response, I believe there's a moderate to high probability that the WHO will declare the outbreak over by August 2024.

Outbreaks are relatively rare but can be severe when they occur. The WHO takes these outbreaks seriously due to their high mortality rate. However, declaring an outbreak 'over' typically requires a significant period without new cases, often twice the maximum incubation period of the virus. Given that the resolution date is August 31, 2024, and the question was created on June 30, 2024, there are only two months for the outbreak to be declared over.

However, the BoE will likely want to ensure inflation is firmly under control before cutting rates, which may take time. The current high inflation environment suggests that rate cuts are not imminent, but by mid-2024, if inflation has significantly moderated and economic growth remains weak, the BoE might consider a cut.

This puts pressure on tech companies to address these issues. Nvidia's market position as a leading provider of GPUs used in AI applications means they have a significant stake in the AI industry and its public perception. Previous commitments, such as their 2021 announcement to achieve 100% renewable energy usage for global operations by 2025, suggest they are aware of and responsive to environmental concerns. The time frame of about a year from the creation date to the resolution date is reasonable for a company to develop and announce new initiatives. Regulatory pressure is also increasing, with a focus on climate change and energy efficiency, which may compel tech companies to reduce their environmental impact. Additionally, competition from other tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, who have made commitments to reduce their carbon footprint, may push Nvidia to keep pace. Technological advancements in energy-efficient AI hardware or software optimizations could also be announced within this timeframe. However, there are factors that might reduce the likelihood, such as the specific focus on AI; Nvidia might announce general energy-saving measures but may not specifically target AI-related electricity consumption. Business priorities may lead Nvidia to focus on performance improvements rather than energy efficiency, especially if demand for high-performance AI continues to grow. If Nvidia believes their current sustainability efforts are sufficient, they might not feel the need to announce new measures specifically for AI. Considering these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high likelihood that Nvidia will announce such measures.

The tech industry has been experiencing a trend of layoffs due to economic uncertainties and cost-cutting measures. However, Spotify has been performing relatively well, with growing user numbers and revenue. The company might be cautious about further layoffs to maintain its growth momentum and employee morale. Still, if economic conditions worsen or if the company faces unexpected challenges, additional layoffs are possible.

While there are concerns about the impact of rising interest rates and global economic slowdown, the Italian government has implemented various measures to support economic growth. The EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility is also providing significant funds to Italy, which could help boost economic activity.

The Fed has been aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation, and these efforts seem to be having an effect. However, inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. A monthly increase exceeding 0.5% is quite significant and would represent a substantial uptick in inflation.

The economic situation could change, but current projections suggest that inflation might still be above the target by mid-2024.

His term is set to end in 2027. Barring any unforeseen circumstances such as resignation, impeachment, or death in office, it is highly unlikely that France will appoint a new President by August 2024. The probability of this occurring is very low, let's estimate it at about 5%. b) Bank of England's base rate remaining at or above 5.00% in August 2024: As of October 2023, the Bank of England's base rate is 5.25%. The bank has been raising rates to combat inflation. However, predicting interest rates over a 10-month period is challenging due to various economic factors. The global economic outlook, inflation trends, and potential recessions all play a role. Given the current high inflation rates and the BoE's commitment to bringing inflation down to its 2% target, it's quite possible that rates will remain elevated through August 2024. However, there's also a chance that economic conditions might change, leading to rate cuts. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of the BoE's base rate remaining at or above 5.00% in August 2024 to be around 70%. Now, to calculate the overall probability of at least one of these events occurring, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) Assuming these events are independent: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.05 * 0.70 = 0.035 Therefore: P(A or B) = 0.05 + 0.70 - 0.035 = 0.715"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0012825233734385932, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00042750779114619775, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.051527730563925796, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This short timeframe makes it less likely for significant changes in patent policy to occur. 2. Pharmaceutical industry norms: Typically, pharmaceutical companies are protective of their patents, especially for profitable drugs like those used to treat prostate cancer. They often maintain exclusivity for as long as possible to maximize profits. 3. Patent life cycle: Without knowing the specific drug or when its patent was issued, it's difficult to determine where it is in its patent life cycle. Most pharmaceutical patents last around 20 years from the filing date. 4. Generic competition pressure: There might be pressure from governments, health organizations, or patient advocacy groups to make the drug more accessible through generic production. However, such pressure usually takes time to result in action. 5. Company's financial interests: Allowing generic production would likely reduce Astellas' profits from this drug. Companies usually only allow this when forced to by patent expiration or when they've developed a newer, more profitable alternative. 6. Lack of specific information: The question doesn't mention any ongoing negotiations, legal challenges, or public pressure that might indicate Astellas is considering allowing generic production. 7.

Current economic conditions: The Eurozone has been experiencing high inflation rates, which led the ECB to implement a series of interest rate hikes to combat inflation. As of early 2024, inflation has been showing signs of moderation but remains above the ECB's 2% target. 2. ECB's monetary policy stance: The ECB has maintained a hawkish stance to bring inflation under control. They have repeatedly stated that they will keep rates 'higher for longer' to ensure inflation returns to target. 3. Economic projections: Many economists expect the ECB to start cutting rates in the second half of 2024 or early 2025, depending on how quickly inflation falls and economic growth evolves. 4. Time frame: The question asks about a cut by July 2024, which is relatively soon given the current policy stance. This gives the ECB limited time to see a sustained decrease in inflation and make a policy shift. 5. Global economic factors: The actions of other major central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, could influence the ECB's decision. If other central banks start cutting rates, it might put pressure on the ECB to follow suit. 6. Eurozone economic performance: If the Eurozone economy shows signs of significant weakness or recession, it could prompt the ECB to cut rates sooner to stimulate growth. 7. Inflation trajectory: If inflation falls faster than expected towards the 2% target, it could give the ECB room to cut rates earlier. Given these factors, it seems more likely that the ECB will wait until later in 2024 or even 2025 to start cutting rates. The July 2024 deadline is quite early considering the current stance and economic conditions. However, there is still a possibility of a rate cut if inflation falls rapidly or if economic conditions deteriorate significantly. The probability of 0.25 reflects that while a rate cut by July 2024 is possible, it is less likely than the ECB maintaining rates or waiting longer to cut. This estimate accounts for the uncertainty in economic projections and the potential for unexpected developments that could prompt earlier action from the ECB."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "8e8ccded-b947-45c4-9a24-d5fe51dda0b4", "title": "Will Hyundai Motor Company resolve a major workers' strike by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if Hyundai Motor Company reaches an agreement with unionized workers, resulting in the end of a significant strike by July 31, 2024.

(a) European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate cut: As of now (June 2023), the ECB has been on a rate-hiking cycle to combat inflation. However, by July 2024, the economic landscape could change significantly. Factors to consider: 1. Inflation trends: If inflation shows signs of cooling down, the ECB might consider rate cuts. 2. Economic growth: If the Eurozone faces a recession or significant slowdown, it could prompt rate cuts. 3. Global economic conditions: Changes in other major economies could influence ECB's decision. 4. Historical precedent: The ECB has shown willingness to adjust rates when necessary.

Historical performance: Mexico has generally maintained positive growth in recent years, barring the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession in 2020. The economy rebounded strongly in 2021 and continued to grow in 2022. 3. External factors: The global economic outlook for 2023-2024 is uncertain, with concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential slowdowns in major economies like the U.S. and China. However, Mexico's strong ties to the U.S. economy could provide some insulation if the U.S. avoids a recession. 4. Domestic policies: The Mexican government has been implementing policies to attract foreign investment and boost domestic growth, which could help sustain economic expansion. 5. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 10 months (October 2023 to July 2024). This relatively short timeframe reduces the likelihood of experiencing two consecutive quarters of negative growth, especially given the current positive momentum. 6. Inflation and monetary policy: The Bank of Mexico has been actively managing inflation through interest rate hikes, which could help maintain economic stability. 7. Trade relationships: Mexico's participation in the USMCA (formerly NAFTA) and other trade agreements provides some economic stability and growth opportunities. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Mexico will avoid a recession by July 2024. The country's economic fundamentals appear relatively strong, and the short timeframe reduces the risk of a sustained downturn. However, there are still significant global economic uncertainties that could potentially impact Mexico's growth."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "0c656b89-5764-4399-8906-058d44873ad1", "title": "Will Sony Corporation resolve a major workers' strike by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if Sony Corporation reaches an agreement with unionized workers, resulting in the end of a significant strike by July 31, 2024.

People tend to consume more snacks during economic uncertainties or when spending more time at home. 3. PepsiCo's focus: PepsiCo has been investing in its snack brands, including Tostitos, through marketing and product innovations. This ongoing investment suggests a commitment to growing the brand. 4. Competition: While Tostitos faces competition from other brands, it remains a strong player in the tortilla chip market. 5. Economic factors: The state of the economy can impact consumer spending on snack foods. However, snacks are often considered affordable indulgences even during economic downturns. 6. Health trends: There's a growing trend towards healthier snacking options, which could potentially impact traditional chip brands. However, Tostitos has been introducing healthier options to adapt to this trend. 7.

The extended timeframe and the relatively low threshold for what constitutes an \"increase\" also work in favor of a positive resolution.

PepsiCo reporting increased North American demand for Tostitos by July 2024: PepsiCo is a large, established company with a diverse product portfolio. Tostitos is a popular brand, but its performance can be affected by various factors such as consumer preferences, marketing strategies, and economic conditions. Without specific recent data on Tostitos' performance, it's difficult to predict with certainty. However, given PepsiCo's strong market position and ability to adapt to consumer trends, there's a moderate chance they could report increased demand for Tostitos. 2. U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 200,000 for four consecutive weeks by August 2024: As of mid-2023, U.S. jobless claims have been relatively low, often below 200,000. However, economic conditions can change rapidly. Factors such as potential economic slowdowns, shifts in monetary policy, or unforeseen global events could lead to increased unemployment. The timeframe until August 2024 is quite long, allowing for significant economic changes. While the U.S. job market has been resilient, there's a non-trivial chance of seeing a period of higher unemployment claims within this timeframe. Combining these factors: - The Tostitos demand increase seems moderately likely, perhaps around 40-50% chance. - The jobless claims scenario, given the extended timeframe and potential for economic shifts, might have a 30-40% chance of occurring.

Current political climate: New Jersey is a predominantly Democratic state with strong support for abortion rights. The state already has laws protecting abortion access. 2. Recent legislative actions: In January 2022, New Jersey passed the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, which codified the right to abortion into state law. This suggests that there might not be an urgent need for a constitutional amendment. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a referendum by July 2024, which is about a year from now. This is a relatively short time frame to organize a statewide referendum, especially if it hasn't been prominently discussed yet. 4. Constitutional amendment process: In New Jersey, to amend the state constitution, the legislature must pass a resolution with a three-fifths majority in both houses, or a simple majority in two consecutive years. Then, it goes to a public vote. This process takes time and requires significant political will. 5. Lack of current public discussion: As of now, there doesn't seem to be widespread public discussion or political momentum for such a referendum in New Jersey. 6. Comparison to other states: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights (e.g., Kansas, Michigan), these were often in response to more restrictive environments or attempts to limit abortion rights. New Jersey already has strong protections in place. 7. Political priorities: With abortion rights already protected by state law, New Jersey lawmakers might focus on other pressing issues rather than pushing for a constitutional amendment. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that New Jersey will hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024.

(a) U.S. Education Department implementing a plan to defer student loan payments: Student loan issues have been a significant concern in recent years, with various deferment and forgiveness plans proposed and implemented. The Biden administration has shown a strong interest in addressing student loan debt. However, previous attempts at large-scale loan forgiveness have faced legal challenges. The timeline (by July 2024) is relatively short, which may limit the ability to implement new plans, especially considering potential legal obstacles.

(b) New Jersey holding a referendum on abortion rights: Abortion rights have become a highly contentious issue in the U.S., especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Many states have been taking steps to either protect or restrict abortion rights. New Jersey already has strong abortion protections in place, but enshrining these rights in the state constitution would provide additional safeguards. The timeline (by July 2024) allows for sufficient time to organize a referendum. However, there's no concrete indication that New Jersey is actively planning such a referendum at this time.

As the incumbent president seeking re-election, Biden is likely to engage with key constituencies like educators. Illinois is a significant state in national politics, making it a plausible location for such an event.

The UFCW is a large and influential union, representing over 1.3 million workers. By July 2024, the presidential race will be well underway, with major party nominees likely determined.

Reporting requirements: The question requires official confirmation from credible sources and reporting by at least two reputable news outlets, which adds a layer of verification that could potentially delay or reduce the official death count. 7.

U.S. Education Department implementing a plan to forgive student loan debt: The Biden administration has been pushing for student loan forgiveness, but has faced legal challenges. In June 2023, the Supreme Court struck down Biden's initial $400 billion student loan forgiveness plan. However, the administration has been working on alternative approaches: a) The Department of Education announced a new income-driven repayment plan called SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education) in August 2023, which could significantly reduce monthly payments for many borrowers. b) The administration is exploring other legal avenues for debt relief under the Higher Education Act. Given the administration's commitment to this issue and the ongoing efforts, there's a moderate chance of a new forgiveness plan being implemented by July 2024. However, potential legal challenges and the approaching election might complicate matters. I'd estimate the probability of this component at around 40%. 2. California holding a referendum on abortion rights: California has already strong protections for abortion rights, including a 2022 ballot measure that enshrined the right to abortion in the state constitution. Given this recent action, there's less urgency for another referendum specifically on this topic. However, California is known for its frequent use of ballot initiatives and referendums. Factors to consider: a) The 2024 election cycle might provide an opportunity for such a referendum. b) Changing national politics or Supreme Court decisions could prompt further action to strengthen abortion rights. c) The state government and pro-choice organizations might focus on other priorities given the existing protections.

However, if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or inflation falls faster than expected, a rate cut becomes more likely. The time frame of about a year provides enough time for economic conditions to potentially warrant a rate cut, but it's not a certainty. There's also a possibility that the RBA might maintain rates if the economy achieves a 'soft landing' where inflation is controlled without significant economic damage.

As of June 2023, the cash rate target is 4.10%. Given the current global economic conditions and the RBA's recent stance, it seems unlikely that they would cut rates in the near future. However, economic conditions can change rapidly, and a year is a long time in economic terms. If inflation pressures ease significantly or if there's an economic downturn, the RBA might consider a rate cut. Still, this seems less likely than maintaining or even potentially increasing rates further. b) U.S. Education Department student loan payment holidays: The U.S. has a history of implementing student loan relief measures, including payment pauses during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Supreme Court recently struck down President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan, which might make the administration more cautious about implementing new relief measures. That said, the Biden administration has shown a strong commitment to addressing student loan issues, and they might look for alternative ways to provide relief, especially as the 2024 election approaches. A payment holiday could be seen as a more moderate approach compared to outright loan forgiveness. Combining these factors: While neither event seems highly likely, the possibility of at least one occurring is not negligible. The U.S. Education Department implementing a payment holiday plan seems more probable than an RBA rate cut, given the political climate and the ongoing focus on student loan issues in the U.S. Given the timeframe of just over a year and the need for only one of these events to occur for a YES resolution, I would estimate the probability to be slightly higher than 50%, but not dramatically so."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, the banking sector in India remains under scrutiny, especially after recent issues with other banks like Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank. Given this context, there's a moderate chance that Yes Bank might face new regulatory curbs. The RBI is known for its proactive approach in maintaining banking sector stability.

Historical precedent: Labor unions, including the UFCW, often endorse presidential candidates. In previous election cycles, the UFCW has typically endorsed Democratic candidates. 2. Timing: The question resolves on July 31, 2024, which is relatively close to the 2024 presidential election (typically held in November). This gives the UFCW ample time to evaluate candidates and make an endorsement decision. 3. Political landscape: As of 2023, the 2024 presidential race is shaping up to be contentious, with labor issues likely to be a significant factor. This increases the likelihood of the UFCW wanting to make their voice heard through an endorsement. 4. Union priorities: The UFCW represents workers in industries such as retail, food processing, and healthcare. They are likely to endorse a candidate who aligns with their priorities on issues like workers' rights, healthcare, and economic policies. 5. Potential candidates: While the full field of candidates is not yet known, it's likely that at least one major candidate will align closely with UFCW's priorities, making an endorsement more probable. 6. Union engagement: The UFCW has a history of political engagement and has made endorsements in previous elections. There's no reason to believe they would abstain from this practice in 2024. 7. Importance of labor support: Presidential candidates often seek union endorsements to boost their credibility with working-class voters. This mutual interest increases the likelihood of an endorsement occurring. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that the UFCW will endorse a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election by July 2024.

Unionization at Google: Google's workforce is not widely unionized. The Alphabet Workers Union, formed in 2021, represents a small fraction of Google's total workforce. This makes a large-scale strike less likely. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a resolution by July 2024, which is about a year from now. This is a relatively short time frame for a major labor dispute to develop, escalate into a significant strike, and then be resolved. 4. Google's financial position: Google (Alphabet) is a highly profitable company with significant resources.

Part A: UFCW endorsement The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) is a large and influential labor union in the United States. Historically, labor unions often endorse presidential candidates, typically favoring Democratic candidates. However, the timing of this question is crucial: 1. The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is before the typical timeframe of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions (usually held in August or September). 2. Labor unions sometimes wait until after the primaries to make their endorsements, when the party nominees are clear. 3. However, given the importance of early momentum in presidential campaigns, there's a chance UFCW might make an earlier endorsement. 4. The incumbent president (assuming Joe Biden runs for re-election) often receives early endorsements from labor unions. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of UFCW making an endorsement by July 2024 at about 60%. Part B: Google workers' strike resolution This part is more speculative, as it depends on a strike occurring and being resolved within a specific timeframe. Consider: 1. As of now (June 2023), there is no ongoing major strike at Google involving 1,000+ workers. 2. Google has faced some labor issues in recent years, but large-scale strikes have been rare. 3. The criteria for resolution are quite specific and stringent (1,000+ participants, lasting at least a week, official statements, multiple news source confirmations). 4. The timeline (by July 2024) gives about a year for a strike to both occur and be resolved. Given the rarity of such large-scale strikes at Google and the specific criteria, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring and being resolved by July 2024 at about 15%.

It received accelerated approval from the FDA in January 2023 and full approval in July 2023. This suggests that the drug has demonstrated efficacy and safety to some degree. The EMA tends to be more conservative in its approvals compared to the FDA. However, given the significant unmet need for Alzheimer's treatments and the drug's approval in the US, there's a reasonable chance for EMA approval.

The probability of at least one of these events happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of neither event happening: 1 - (1 - 0.4) * (1 - 0.3) = 1 - 0.6 * 0.7 = 1 - 0.42 = 0.58.

There's currently no strong push for a referendum on abortion rights in New York, as the right is already protected by state law. 4.

Current economic conditions: As of June 2024, Mexico's economy has been experiencing moderate growth, but inflation remains a concern. The central bank has been maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy to control inflation. 2. Inflation trends: If inflation shows signs of easing by mid-2024, it could provide room for the central bank to consider rate cuts. However, if inflation remains persistent, the bank may be hesitant to cut rates. 3. Global economic context: The actions of major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, influence Mexico's monetary policy. If global economic conditions soften and other central banks begin easing, it could create pressure for Mexico to follow suit. 4. Domestic political pressure: There might be political pressure to stimulate economic growth through monetary easing, especially if growth slows down. 5. Time frame: The question allows for a two-month window (July and August 2024) for the announcement to be made, which increases the likelihood compared to a shorter timeframe. 6. Historical behavior: The Bank of Mexico tends to be cautious and often follows the Fed's lead. If the Fed signals or implements rate cuts in the first half of 2024, it increases the chances of Mexico following suit. 7. Forward guidance: Any hints or forward guidance from the Bank of Mexico in the months leading up to August 2024 would be crucial indicators of their intentions. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The main arguments in favor are potential easing of global monetary conditions, possible political pressure for growth, and the two-month window.

Current status of Fisker: Fisker is a relatively new player in the electric vehicle market, having started production of its first model, the Fisker Ocean, in late 2022. As a startup, it may be more likely to seek government support for expansion and development. 2. U.S. government's stance on electric vehicles: The Biden administration has shown strong support for the electric vehicle industry, aiming to accelerate the transition to clean energy. This includes significant funding allocations for EV infrastructure and manufacturing. 3. Existing grant programs: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has various grant programs supporting clean energy initiatives, including the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program. However, these are typically loans rather than grants. 4. Competition for funding: Many established automakers and other EV startups are also likely to be competing for any available government funding, which could reduce Fisker's chances of securing a large grant. 5. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of July 2024, which is about a year away. This is a relatively short time frame for securing such a large grant, especially considering the typically lengthy process of government funding applications and approvals. 6. Amount specified: $500 million is a substantial amount for a grant, particularly for a single company. Most government support in this sector tends to be in the form of loans or tax incentives rather than outright grants of this magnitude. 7. Fisker's current financial situation: As of early 2023, Fisker has been focusing on ramping up production and deliveries. While they might be seeking additional funding, there have been no public indications of pursuit of such a large government grant. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Fisker will receive over $500 million in grants specifically for electric vehicle initiatives by July 2024.

As of June 2023, the interest rate is at 11.25%. While there's a general expectation that rates will eventually come down, the timing is uncertain. Factors to consider: 1. Inflation in Mexico is still above target, but showing signs of moderation. 2. Global economic conditions, particularly in the US, influence Mexico's monetary policy. 3.

The implementation of voting restrictions is a politically charged issue, often along party lines. Republican-controlled states might be more likely to consider such measures, citing election integrity concerns. However, the specific 72-hour waiting period is unusual, and most voting restriction efforts focus on other aspects like voter ID laws or limiting mail-in voting.

This indicates a strong political will to make this happen. 3. Prevalence of cholesterol medications: Cholesterol medications, particularly statins, are among the most commonly prescribed drugs for older adults, who make up the majority of Medicare beneficiaries. This makes it likely that a major cholesterol medication would be a priority for negotiation. 4. Recent legislation: The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, allows Medicare to negotiate prices for certain high-cost drugs starting in 2026. However, the question asks about August 2024, which is earlier than the Act's timeline. 5. Potential challenges: Pharmaceutical companies may resist these negotiations or challenge them legally, which could delay the process. 6. Specificity of the question: The question requires not just negotiation, but also official confirmation and reporting by reputable news sources, which adds additional steps to the process. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of this occurring by August 2024. The political will is there, and cholesterol medications are likely to be a priority.

If no such recognition occurs by the specified date, or if another conductor is recognized as younger in such a role, the question resolves as NO.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-31T23:59:59Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-06-30T23:59:59Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.02, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of this question resolving as YES, we need to consider several factors: 1. Current status: As of now, neither Nicholas Collon nor Daniel Harding has been explicitly recognized as the youngest music director of a major orchestra. If they had been, it would likely be widely known in the classical music community. 2. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is about a month from the creation date. This is a relatively short period for such a recognition to occur if it hasn't already happened. 3. Age factor: Nicholas Collon was born in 1983, making him currently about 41 years old. Daniel Harding was born in 1975, making him currently about 49 years old. These ages are not particularly young for music directors of major orchestras. 4. Current positions: Nicholas Collon is the principal conductor of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Daniel Harding is the music and artistic director of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Both are prestigious positions, but not necessarily with orchestras considered among the very top tier globally. 5. Competition: There are likely younger conductors who have been appointed to major orchestras. For example, Gustavo Dudamel became music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic at age 28 in 2009. 6. Recognition process: For this to resolve as YES, not only would one of these conductors need to be the youngest, but they would need to be officially recognized as such by at least two reputable sources within the next month. This seems unlikely given the short timeframe and the fact that such a recognition hasn't occurred already. 7. Historical context: The trend of very young conductors being appointed to major orchestras was more common in the past. In recent years, orchestras have tended to favor more experienced conductors. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that either Nicholas Collon or Daniel Harding will be recognized as the youngest music director of a major orchestra by July 2024. They are both accomplished conductors, but their ages and current positions suggest that they are past the point where they would be considered for such a distinction. Furthermore, the short timeframe makes it even less likely for such a recognition to occur if it hasn't already."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09780012368517355, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.032600041228391184, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.33780480521758294, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The WHO declared the end of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for Zika virus in November 2016. Since then, Zika has been managed as an ongoing public health challenge rather than an emergency. 2.

This is a relatively short period for significant changes in the global health landscape. 3. WHO's approach to disease outbreaks: The WHO typically declares an outbreak over when there is a significant reduction in new cases and the virus is no longer spreading rapidly. For Zika, this has already occurred on a global scale. 4. Regional considerations: While Zika is not a global emergency, it may still be a concern in specific regions. The WHO might be monitoring these areas but is unlikely to make a global declaration about an outbreak that is already considered managed. 5. WHO's focus: Given the ongoing challenges with other diseases and potential new health threats, the WHO may not prioritize making a formal declaration about Zika, especially when it's not currently considered an emergency. 6. Nature of Zika virus: Zika is endemic in some regions, meaning it's continuously present at low levels. This makes it less likely for the WHO to declare a complete end to Zika presence globally. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the WHO would make a new declaration about the Zika outbreak ending by August 2024. The organization has already shifted its approach to Zika from emergency response to ongoing management years ago.

As of 2023, Zika is no longer considered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO. However, the virus continues to circulate at low levels in many countries. The WHO typically declares an outbreak over when there have been no new cases for a specific period, usually twice the incubation period of the disease. For Zika, this would be about 28 days. Given that Zika is still present in some areas but at much lower levels, it's possible but not highly likely that the WHO would make a formal declaration ending the outbreak by August 2024. I would estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. b) Global Fund announcing over $400 million in new funding by July 2024: The Global Fund is a major international organization that invests about $4 billion a year to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. While Zika is not one of their primary focus areas, they have been known to respond to other health crises. $400 million is a significant amount, but not unprecedented for the Global Fund. However, several factors make this less likely: 1. The Global Fund typically focuses on HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. 2. Zika is no longer considered a global emergency. 3. The COVID-19 pandemic has strained many health funding sources. 4. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a large funding announcement. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of the Global Fund announcing over $400 million in new funding by July 2024 at about 20%.

Netflix's current strategy: Historically, Netflix has focused on original content and scripted programming rather than live sports. However, they have shown increasing interest in sports-related content, such as documentaries and series. 2. Recent trends: Streaming platforms are increasingly venturing into live sports to attract and retain subscribers. Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, and Peacock have all made significant moves in this direction. 3. Netflix's financial position: The company has been experiencing slower growth and increased competition, which might push them to explore new content avenues like sports to attract subscribers. 4. Time frame: The question gives about a year for this to happen (from the creation date to the resolution date), which is a reasonable amount of time for negotiations and announcements of such partnerships. 5. Potential partners: There are numerous major sports leagues and events that Netflix could potentially partner with, increasing the chances of a deal being struck. 6. Netflix's recent actions: The company has been experimenting with live streaming capabilities, which could be a precursor to entering the live sports market. 7. Market pressure: As competitors continue to invest in sports rights, Netflix may feel compelled to follow suit to remain competitive. However, there are also factors that might reduce the likelihood: 1. Cost: Sports rights are extremely expensive, and Netflix has traditionally been cautious about such high-cost investments. 2. Infrastructure: Live sports require different technological capabilities than Netflix's current on-demand model. 3. Netflix's content strategy: The company might choose to focus on sports-adjacent content (documentaries, series) rather than live sports broadcasting. 4. Existing contracts: Many major sports rights are tied up in long-term contracts with traditional broadcasters or other streaming services. Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance that Netflix will announce a major sports media partnership by July 2024.

This is a relatively short period for such a complex case, but not impossible. 3. NFL's financial incentives: The NFL has strong incentives to settle for less than the jury award. A settlement would likely be tax-deductible, whereas a court judgment might not be. Additionally, settling would avoid further legal costs and potential appeals. 4. Legal strategy: The NFL is likely to appeal the jury's decision. This could be used as leverage in settlement negotiations, as the uncertainty of an appeal outcome might encourage plaintiffs to accept a lower amount. 5. Precedent: Large antitrust cases often settle for less than initial jury awards. For example, the NCAA's antitrust case regarding athlete compensation settled for significantly less than the potential damages. 6. Public relations: The NFL may want to settle to avoid prolonged negative publicity and to demonstrate good faith in addressing antitrust concerns. 7. Plaintiff's perspective: The plaintiffs might be willing to accept a lower settlement to avoid the uncertainty and delay of appeals, and to secure a guaranteed payout. 8. Magnitude of reduction: The question asks if the settlement will be less than $4.7 billion, which allows for a settlement very close to this amount (e.g., $4.6 billion) to still count as a YES. Given these factors, I believe there is a good chance the NFL will settle for less than $4.7 billion by July 2024.

However, they have been experimenting with sports-adjacent content and documentaries. The company's stance on live sports has been evolving, and they might be looking for strategic partnerships to enter this space without bearing the full cost of rights. Given the timeframe (about a year), and Netflix's growing interest in sports content, there's a moderate chance they might announce a partnership. However, the requirement for it to be with a major sports league or event sets a high bar. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. (b) NFL settling the 'Sunday Ticket' antitrust case for less than $4.7 billion: The NFL Sunday Ticket antitrust case is a complex legal matter. Antitrust cases can be unpredictable and often take years to resolve. The NFL has significant resources and motivation to fight this case, given the importance of their media rights. The specific settlement amount mentioned ($4.7 billion) is quite large, which suggests that settling for less than this amount might be seen as a significant concession by the NFL. Given the NFL's strong position in the sports media landscape and their historical approach to protecting their rights, a settlement of this magnitude seems unlikely in the given timeframe. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 15%. Combining probabilities: For the question to resolve YES, either of these events needs to occur.

This is a relatively short timeframe for federal rulemaking, which often takes 18-24 months or longer. 2. Current state of telehealth regulations: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the adoption and expansion of telehealth services. Many temporary measures were put in place to facilitate telehealth during the public health emergency.

Political climate: The Biden administration has generally been supportive of expanding access to healthcare, including through telehealth. This suggests a favorable environment for such regulations. 4. Existing initiatives: The HHS has already shown interest in telehealth regulation. For example, in May 2023, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to modify the HIPAA Privacy Rule to expand the ability of healthcare providers to use remote communication technologies to provide audio-only telehealth services. 5. Complexity of the issue: Telehealth involves various aspects such as privacy, security, interstate licensing, reimbursement, and quality of care. Crafting comprehensive regulations that address all these issues could be time-consuming. 6.

(a) World Bank funding commitments: The World Bank regularly announces new funding commitments for various global development projects. Given the timeframe (by July 31, 2024) and the relatively modest amount ($400 million), this seems quite likely. The World Bank's annual commitments typically run into billions of dollars. For example, in fiscal year 2022, the World Bank Group institutions committed over $115 billion. Even if we consider only a fraction of this for new initiatives, surpassing $400 million is highly probable. The requirement for official announcements and reputable news source reporting is also likely to be met, as World Bank activities are closely followed by international media. (b) Spain's IBEX 35 index reaching 10,000 points: As of June 30, 2023, the IBEX 35 is trading around 9,500 points. Reaching 10,000 points would require an increase of about 5.3% over a period of 14 months (from July 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024). This is certainly achievable, especially considering that we only need it to reach this level at any point during this period, not necessarily to close at this level. However, economic uncertainties, including potential recessions and geopolitical tensions, could hinder this growth. Combining the probabilities: For the question to resolve as YES, we only need one of these events to occur. The World Bank funding commitment seems highly likely (I would estimate around 90% probability), while the IBEX 35 reaching 10,000 points is less certain but still possible (I would estimate around 60% probability).

Potential for change: While unlikely, it's not impossible that a Republican candidate could emerge with policies that strongly appeal to union workers, or that the Democratic candidate could take positions that alienate the UAW. 7. UAW's focus: The union might choose to focus on specific issues rather than endorsing a particular candidate, especially if they feel neither party fully represents their interests. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the UAW would endorse a Republican candidate by July 2024. The union's long-standing alignment with Democratic policies, recent positive interactions with the Biden administration, and the current UAW leadership's political leanings all point towards either a Democratic endorsement or no early endorsement at all. However, we must account for the small possibility of unexpected political shifts or the emergence of a uniquely labor-friendly Republican candidate.

Lack of public discussion: If such a significant event as a statewide referendum on climate change policy were to occur, there would likely be substantial public discussion and media coverage leading up to it. The absence of such discussion makes it highly unlikely that a referendum is planned. 7. Alternative policy-making methods: New York has been addressing climate change through other means, such as the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act passed in 2019. The state tends to rely on legislative action and executive orders for climate policy rather than referendums. Given these factors, particularly the extremely short time frame, the lack of historical precedent for such referendums in New York, and the absence of any current indications that such a vote is being planned, it is highly unlikely that New York will hold a referendum on climate change policy by August 2024."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "8b9d33cb-a5cc-40e4-a0a7-54de1440b491", "title": "Will either of the following occur by August 2024: (1) The U.S. Senate passes a bill cutting NASA's budget by more than 20% (2) New York holds a referendum on climate change policy?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if either of the following events occur by August 31, 2024: (1) The United States Senate passes a bill that includes a reduction of more than 20% in the budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) compared to its current fiscal year's budget.

New York holding a referendum on climate change policy: - New York has been proactive in addressing climate change, but typically through legislative action rather than referendums. - Statewide referendums are relatively rare in New York, usually reserved for constitutional amendments. - Climate change is a pressing issue, but it's more likely to be addressed through normal legislative channels rather than a specific referendum. - The timeframe (by August 2024) is again quite short for organizing a statewide referendum on such a complex issue.

Magnitude of the tariff: A 50% or higher tariff is quite substantial and would significantly impact trade. Such a high tariff might face opposition from member states concerned about rising costs for solar energy transition. 5. Specific targeting: The requirement for the tariff to be specifically on Chinese-made solar panels, rather than a broader measure, makes it more challenging to implement but also more likely given the specific concerns about Chinese dominance in this sector. 6. EU's climate goals: The EU has ambitious climate targets, and solar energy plays a crucial role. A high tariff could potentially slow down solar adoption due to increased costs, which might make some policymakers hesitant. 7. Global trade environment: The ongoing tensions between China and Western countries, including concerns about economic security, could push the EU towards more protectionist measures. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of this occurring.

Incentives for settlement: Both parties may have incentives to settle: - For the plaintiff (the Texas woman), a settlement could provide quicker resolution and compensation without the stress and uncertainty of a trial. - For the defendants (local authorities), settling could help avoid negative publicity and potential precedent-setting court decisions. 4. Legal complexities: The case involves charges related to a self-managed abortion, which is a legally complex area given the changing landscape of abortion laws in Texas and nationwide. This complexity could either encourage settlement to avoid uncertain legal outcomes or prolong negotiations. 5. Political considerations: Given the sensitive nature of abortion-related cases, there may be political pressure on local authorities to either fight the case or settle quickly, depending on the local political climate. 6. Precedent: Many civil rights cases against government entities do end in settlements, as both parties often prefer to avoid lengthy and costly trials. 7. Public pressure: The high-profile nature of the case might create public pressure for a resolution, potentially pushing towards a settlement. Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate to good chance of a settlement being reached by July 2024. The political sensitivity and potential for negative publicity for the local authorities may push them towards settlement. However, the complexity of the legal issues and the contentious nature of abortion rights in Texas could potentially prolong negotiations."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "60ab6303-6497-43ed-9bcf-75f6538add5d", "title": "Will Arizona enact legislation restricting the public carrying of non-firearm weapons by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, Arizona officially passes and enacts legislation that imposes new restrictions on the public carrying of non-firearm weapons, such as bladed weapons or other non-firearm implements.

Existing laws: Arizona already has some laws regulating certain weapons, but they are relatively permissive compared to many other states. There's no indication of a strong push for more restrictions on non-firearm weapons. 3.

This is a tight timeline for significant legislative changes, especially on a potentially controversial topic. 4. Recent events or public pressure: There doesn't seem to be any notable recent events or strong public pressure in Arizona calling for restrictions on non-firearm weapons. Without such catalysts, it's less likely for this type of legislation to gain traction. 5. Legislative priorities: Given other pressing issues like water management, education, and economic development, it's unlikely that restricting non-firearm weapons would be a top priority for Arizona lawmakers. 6. Political composition of the Arizona legislature: As of 2023, Republicans hold a slim majority in both chambers of the Arizona legislature. This composition makes it less likely for weapon restriction laws to pass, as Republicans generally favor less restrictive weapon laws. 7.

(a) Texas woman's lawsuit settlement by July 2024: This case involves a sensitive and controversial topic - abortion rights in Texas. Such cases often attract significant public attention and legal scrutiny. However, legal proceedings, especially those involving constitutional rights, can be lengthy and complex. The timeline given (by July 2024) is relatively short for a settlement in such a high-profile case. Settlements are often preferred to avoid lengthy trials, but the politically charged nature of this case might make a quick settlement less likely.

(b) Arizona enacting legislation restricting public carrying of non-firearm weapons by August 2024: This part seems more likely to occur. State legislatures often pass new laws related to public safety and weapon regulations. The timeframe (by August 2024) allows for more than a year for such legislation to be proposed, debated, and enacted. Additionally, concerns about public safety often drive such legislative actions. However, there might be opposition from civil liberties groups or those concerned about self-defense rights. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%.

The Biden administration has maintained many of the Trump-era tariffs but has also shown willingness to negotiate. 3. Time frame: The question asks about August 2024, which is more than a year away.

It's less likely for a country to experience two consecutive quarters of negative growth within such a short period unless there's a severe economic shock. 8. COVID-19 recovery: Indonesia, like many countries, was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic but has been showing signs of recovery. The continuation of this recovery trend supports positive growth prospects. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Indonesia will avoid a recession by July 2024. The country's economic fundamentals appear solid, and it has a history of resilience. However, there are always uncertainties in economic forecasting, particularly given global economic challenges and potential unforeseen events."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "8bc9fef7-f528-4eae-8cd6-22ca33652c53", "title": "Will the World Health Organization declare the current measles outbreak over by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declares the ongoing measles outbreak over by August 31, 2024.

Current status of the outbreak: As of June 2024, there is a significant global measles outbreak that has prompted heightened public health responses. This suggests the outbreak is severe and widespread. 2. Timeline: The resolution date is August 31, 2024, which is only two months from the creation date of this question. This is a relatively short period for a global outbreak to be fully contained and declared over. 3. Nature of measles outbreaks: Measles is highly contagious and can spread rapidly, especially in areas with low vaccination rates. Outbreaks can be persistent and difficult to control quickly. 4. WHO's declaration process: The WHO typically declares an outbreak over when there have been no new cases for a certain period, usually twice the incubation period of the disease. For measles, this would be about 42 days (21 days incubation period x 2). 5. Global vaccination efforts: The effectiveness and speed of vaccination campaigns in affected areas will play a crucial role in controlling the outbreak. 6. Potential for resurgence: Even if the outbreak seems to be under control, the WHO might be cautious about declaring it over too soon due to the risk of resurgence. 7. Previous measles outbreaks: Historical data shows that significant measles outbreaks can often take several months to over a year to be fully controlled. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the WHO would declare the outbreak over by August 2024. The short timeframe between the question's creation and resolution dates is particularly concerning, as it suggests the outbreak is still active in June 2024. Two months is a very short period to see a global outbreak fully contained and to have enough confidence to declare it over. However, there is always a possibility of rapid and effective global response leading to quick control of the outbreak. Additionally, if the outbreak is primarily concentrated in a few regions rather than being truly global, it might be easier to contain quickly. Considering all these factors, I would assign a low probability to this event occurring."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "d350bc5d-ea0a-4746-a0a3-a1ba34954201", "title": "Will either the Indonesian economy avoid a recession by July 2024, or the WHO declare the current measles outbreak over by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) The Indonesian economy does not enter a recession by July 31, 2024, with a recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth as reported by Statistics Indonesia, or (b) The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declares the ongoing measles outbreak over by August 31, 2024, with confirmation through official WHO announcements or reports from at least three reputable news sources.

Indonesian economy avoiding recession by July 2024: Indonesia has shown resilience in recent years, with steady economic growth. The country's GDP growth was 5.31% in 2022 and is projected to be around 5% in 2023. The Indonesian government has been implementing various policies to maintain economic stability and growth. Additionally, Indonesia benefits from a large domestic market, diverse natural resources, and strategic location in Southeast Asia. These factors make it less likely for Indonesia to enter a recession in the near future. However, global economic uncertainties, potential trade tensions, and unforeseen events could still pose risks. Given the current economic indicators and projections, I would estimate the probability of Indonesia avoiding a recession by July 2024 to be around 0.85. 2. WHO declaring the current measles outbreak over by August 2024: Measles outbreaks can be challenging to control, but with proper vaccination efforts and public health measures, they can be contained. The duration of outbreaks can vary significantly depending on the region, vaccination rates, and effectiveness of control measures. The WHO typically declares an outbreak over when there have been no new cases for a certain period, usually twice the incubation period of the disease. For measles, this would be about 42 days. Given that we don't have specific information about the current outbreak's severity or location, it's difficult to make a precise estimate. However, considering that most measles outbreaks are controlled within several months to a year, and given the timeframe until August 2024, I would estimate the probability of the WHO declaring the outbreak over by then to be around 0.75. To calculate the overall probability of at least one of these events occurring, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) (assuming independence) P(at least one event) = 0.85 + 0.75 - (0.85 * 0.75) = 0.9625.

The index has never reached 3,500 points before, which suggests it would be a significant milestone. 2. Current level: As of June 2023, the KOSPI was trading around 2,600 points. To reach 3,500 points, it would need to increase by approximately 35% in about 14 months. 3. Economic factors: South Korea's economy is heavily export-dependent, particularly in sectors like semiconductors, electronics, and automobiles. Global economic conditions, trade relations, and technological advancements in these sectors will play a crucial role. 4.

Large-scale industrial projects like battery factories are usually planned well in advance and involve significant investments and agreements between companies and local governments. While cancellations can occur due to unforeseen circumstances (economic downturns, regulatory issues, etc.), they are not common, especially within a short timeframe (about 2 months from the question's creation to its resolution).

Reaching 3,500 points would require a significant increase of about 35% in just over a year. While such increases are not unprecedented, they are relatively rare, especially for mature markets. The KOSPI's all-time high is around 3,300 points, reached in 2021. Factors that could drive such a surge include a strong economic recovery, favorable geopolitical conditions, or a boom in key Korean industries like semiconductors or electric vehicles.

The company has been actively seeking to expand its sports portfolio to compete in the streaming era. They have a slightly longer timeframe (about a month) to announce a new partnership. Sports rights deals are often planned well in advance, and companies frequently time their announcements strategically.

However, there have been discussions about potentially regulating cryptocurrencies rather than maintaining an outright ban. The Nigerian government has shown interest in blockchain technology and has even launched its own digital currency, the eNaira.

Let's analyze each separately: 1. President Biden speaking at an NEA event in Pennsylvania: - Biden has a strong relationship with the NEA and has spoken at their events in the past. - Pennsylvania is a key swing state, and Biden has roots there, making it a likely location for campaign events. - However, the timeframe is relatively short (about a month), which reduces the likelihood of this specific event occurring. - The NEA typically holds its annual meeting in July, but the location varies. There's no guarantee it will be in Pennsylvania in 2024. 2. Iowa Senate passing a total abortion ban: - Iowa has a Republican-controlled legislature and has previously passed restrictive abortion laws. - The state has been trying to implement stricter abortion laws, with a recent attempt to pass a six-week ban. - However, previous attempts have faced legal challenges and have been blocked by courts. - The definition of 'total abortion ban' in this question is very strict, allowing only limited exceptions. - The short timeframe (about a month) reduces the likelihood of passing such significant legislation. Given these factors, both events seem possible but not highly probable within the given timeframe. The Biden speech seems slightly more likely due to his relationship with the NEA and the importance of Pennsylvania in elections. The Iowa abortion ban, while aligned with the state's political leanings, faces more obstacles in terms of drafting, passing, and potentially defending such strict legislation in a short time.

However, there are concerns about a potential economic slowdown or recession in the coming year. The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes to combat inflation could lead to increased unemployment.

The company has faced criticism for its anti-union tactics in the past, which suggests they might not be eager to finalize a contract quickly. 3. Recent developments: In June 2022, an Apple store in Towson, Maryland, became the first to unionize in the US.

Monetary policy: The Brazilian Central Bank's decisions on interest rates can significantly impact the stock market. Lower interest rates generally favor stock market growth. 8. External shocks: Unforeseen events (like global crises or natural disasters) could potentially hinder the index's recovery. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to good chance of the Bovespa index recovering to its October 2023 level by August 2024. The improving economic conditions in Brazil and the potential for interest rate cuts are positive factors. However, the relatively short time frame and potential external risks make a full recovery less certain."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "ec1934b2-a463-49da-a4c6-f88dba4c0302", "title": "Will the Bank of Korea announce a reduction in its key interest rate by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if the Bank of Korea publicly announces a reduction in its key interest rate by August 31, 2024.

Bovespa index recovery: The Bovespa index, Brazil's main stock market index, has been volatile in recent years due to various economic and political factors. As of October 1, 2023, the index was likely at a relatively high level due to the general global market recovery post-COVID. For the index to recover to that level by August 2024, it would need to overcome any potential downturns that might occur in the meantime.

However, by August 2024, there's a good chance that inflationary pressures might have eased, potentially allowing for rate cuts. The global economic situation, including actions by major central banks like the Federal Reserve, will influence this decision. Given the time frame (over a year from now) and the cyclical nature of monetary policy, there's a reasonable chance of a rate cut. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%.

Political factors: Any changes in government policies or economic reforms could impact the central bank's decision-making process. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a cut by July 2024, which gives the central bank a year to make this decision. This is a relatively long time in economic terms, allowing for potential changes in economic conditions. Given these factors, there are arguments both for and against an interest rate cut: For a cut: - If inflation continues to decrease, the central bank may have room to cut rates to stimulate economic growth. - The current high interest rate may not be sustainable in the long term, especially if global economic conditions soften. - A year is a considerable time frame, allowing for economic conditions to potentially improve and warrant a rate cut. Against a cut: - The central bank may remain cautious and maintain high rates to ensure inflation stays under control. - Uncertain global economic conditions might lead to a more conservative monetary policy approach. - Political instability or lack of economic reforms could delay rate cuts. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high likelihood of an interest rate cut by July 2024. The long time frame and the current high interest rate suggest that if economic conditions continue to improve, even marginally, the central bank will likely have room for at least a small cut. However, there are still significant uncertainties that prevent this from being a near-certainty."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "6115437e-74cd-4eb7-96b9-96f0823c6318", "title": "Will either South Dakota hold a referendum on environmental policies or the Central Bank of Brazil announce an interest rate cut by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if either of the following occurs by July 31, 2024: (a) South Dakota officially conducts a statewide referendum specifically on the topic of environmental policies.

The state has not shown a recent history of holding referendums specifically on environmental policies. Moreover, the timeframe is relatively short (about one month from the creation date to the resolution date), which makes it less likely for a referendum to be organized, announced, and conducted within this period. The probability of this event occurring is quite low. b) Central Bank of Brazil announcing an interest rate cut: This part is more likely to occur. The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) regularly reviews its monetary policy, and the Selic rate (the bank's benchmark interest rate) is a key tool in managing inflation and economic growth. As of June 2023, Brazil's Selic rate was at 13.75%, which is relatively high. Given global economic trends and potential pressures to stimulate economic growth, there's a reasonable chance that the BCB might consider a rate cut within the given timeframe. The Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the BCB meets approximately every 45 days to decide on interest rates. This means there will likely be at least one meeting within the specified timeframe where a rate cut could be announced. However, we must also consider that economic conditions can be unpredictable, and the BCB's decision will depend on various factors such as inflation rates, economic growth, and global economic conditions at the time. Combining these factors, the probability of a rate cut by the Central Bank of Brazil seems moderate to high, while the probability of a South Dakota referendum on environmental policies is very low. Given that only one of these events needs to occur for the question to resolve as YES, and considering the higher likelihood of the Brazilian interest rate cut, I would estimate the overall probability to be moderately high."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0028541811904853054, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0009513937301617684, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07550665054113241, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given this recent action, there might be less urgency for a constitutional amendment. However, some advocates argue that a constitutional amendment would provide stronger, more permanent protection.

Without specific information about Takeda's plans or any ongoing negotiations, it's unlikely that they would voluntarily allow generic production.

Putin's control over legislative bodies: Putin's United Russia party holds a majority in both houses of parliament.

Against a rate cut: - Inflation might remain persistent, requiring continued tight monetary policy. - The central bank may prefer to wait longer to ensure inflation is firmly under control before cutting rates. - External economic shocks could delay the easing cycle.

Reaching 130,000 points would require an increase of about 8-13% over a period of 10 months. This is certainly possible, given that the Brazilian economy has been showing signs of recovery and the global economic outlook is improving.

Public pressure: Increasing public awareness of climate issues could push both entities to take visible actions like vehicle conversions. 8. Economic factors: The cost of converting vehicles and the availability of biofuels could impact the decision. 9. Announcement requirements: The criteria for announcement and reporting are quite specific, which might slightly reduce the probability if actions are taken but not widely reported. Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high chance of this event occurring. The commitment of both entities to environmental causes, the existing precedent of vehicle conversions, and the reasonable timeframe all contribute to the likelihood.

Political climate: NYC has historically been proactive in regulating the short-term rental market to protect affordable housing and maintain neighborhood character. However, the current administration under Mayor Eric Adams has not indicated any immediate plans for further restrictions. 5. Economic factors: The tourism industry is crucial for NYC's economy. While there's a desire to regulate short-term rentals, there's also a need to balance this with maintaining tourism appeal. 6.

(a) New York City announcing plans to restrict short-term rental units: New York City has already been taking steps to regulate short-term rentals, particularly targeting platforms like Airbnb. In 2022, the city implemented stricter regulations for short-term rentals. Given this trend and the ongoing concerns about housing affordability and availability for long-term residents, it's quite possible that NYC might announce further restrictions by July 2024. However, since significant regulations are already in place, the likelihood of additional major announcements is somewhat reduced. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. (b) Canadian median home price reaching a new record high: The Canadian housing market has been volatile in recent years, with periods of rapid price increases followed by corrections. As of 2023, the market has been showing signs of recovery after a downturn caused by rising interest rates. Several factors support the possibility of reaching a new record high: 1. Persistent housing supply shortages in major urban areas. 2. Continued population growth and immigration. 3. Potential interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada if inflation stabilizes. 4. Pent-up demand from buyers who have been waiting for market conditions to improve. However, there are also factors that could prevent a new record high: 1. High interest rates might persist longer than expected. 2. Economic uncertainties or a potential recession could dampen demand. 3. Government interventions aimed at cooling the market. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Canadian home prices reaching a new record high by July 2024 at around 60%. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.40 + 0.60 - (0.40 * 0.60) = 0.76.

Economic outlook: The U.S. economy has been showing resilience despite concerns about inflation and potential recession. However, there are still uncertainties about its future trajectory. 3. Federal Reserve actions: The Fed has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could potentially slow down economic growth and lead to increased unemployment. 4. Historical trends: During economic downturns, jobless claims can spike rapidly. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, claims exceeded 300,000 for extended periods. 5. Time frame: The question asks about the period from now until August 2024, which is over a year. This provides a significant window for economic conditions to change. 6. Threshold and consistency: The question requires not just exceeding 300,000 claims, but doing so for three consecutive weeks, which is a more stringent condition. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of this occurring. The U.S. economy is currently strong, but there are concerns about a potential recession in the near future. If a recession does occur within the next year, it could easily push jobless claims above 300,000 for several weeks. However, the requirement for three consecutive weeks makes this less likely than a single week spike. Additionally, the resilience of the job market in recent years, even in the face of economic challenges, suggests that reaching this threshold consistently might be difficult.

However, mechanics are generally considered essential personnel, and there's strong pressure to resolve disputes quickly. 4. Economic factors: The summer months (including August) are typically peak travel seasons. Both airlines and unions are usually motivated to avoid or quickly resolve strikes during these periods due to the high economic impact. 5. Negotiation processes: Labor negotiations in the airline industry often involve federal mediation and can be lengthy, but outright strikes are usually a last resort. Even if a strike were to begin, there would likely be intense efforts to resolve it before it extends into months. 6.

Without specific data, it's difficult to gauge how common or rare such an occurrence is. 3. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 14 months (from now until August 2024). This is a significant amount of time during which economic conditions could change dramatically. 4. Global economic factors: The global economy faces uncertainties due to factors such as inflation, interest rate changes, and geopolitical tensions. These could potentially impact France's job market. 5. Seasonal fluctuations: Jobless claims often have seasonal patterns. We'd need to consider if there are typically periods of higher claims during certain times of the year. 6. Government policies: Any changes in French labor laws or economic policies could influence jobless claims. 7. Potential for economic shocks: Unforeseen events (like a new pandemic wave, major geopolitical conflicts, or financial crises) could suddenly increase jobless claims. Given these considerations, I believe the probability is relatively low, but not negligible. France's economy has been relatively stable, and for this to occur, there would likely need to be a significant economic downturn or shock.

The Bank of England's primary mandate is to maintain price stability, targeting a 2% inflation rate. 2. Inflation outlook: The Bank of England expects inflation to fall sharply over the coming months and years. However, the exact trajectory is uncertain and depends on various factors, including energy prices and global economic conditions. 3. Economic growth: The UK economy has been showing signs of weakness, with slow growth or potential recession. This could put pressure on the BoE to cut rates to stimulate economic activity. 4. Global economic trends: Global economic conditions, including actions by other major central banks like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, can influence the BoE's decisions. 5. Time frame: The question asks about a cut by July 2024, which is about a year away. This provides a significant window for economic conditions to change and potentially warrant a rate cut. 6. Historical patterns: Central banks typically don't cut rates immediately after a hiking cycle. There's usually a period of stability before considering cuts. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut by July 2024. The BoE is likely to wait for clear evidence that inflation is sustainably trending towards its 2% target before considering cuts. However, if economic growth remains weak and inflation falls faster than expected, a cut could be on the table. The time frame of about a year provides enough time for economic conditions to evolve, potentially necessitating a rate cut. However, it's also possible that inflation remains stubborn or that the economy shows resilience, which would delay any rate cuts.

As of 2023, the weekly jobless claims have not consistently exceeded 200,000. For this to occur, there would need to be a significant economic downturn or major structural changes in the French economy. While possible, especially given global economic uncertainties, it's not highly likely in the given timeframe. (b) The Bank of England announcing an interest rate cut by July 31, 2024: The Bank of England, like many central banks, has been in a tightening cycle to combat inflation. As of 2023, the focus has been on controlling inflation rather than stimulating growth. However, economic conditions can change rapidly. If inflation comes under control and economic growth slows, there could be pressure to cut rates. The timeframe (about a year) allows for potential economic shifts that might necessitate a rate cut. Considering both scenarios: Scenario (a) seems less likely due to the current stability of the French labor market. Scenario (b) is more plausible given the longer time frame and the dynamic nature of monetary policy. It's important to note that only one of these needs to occur for the question to resolve as YES. This significantly increases the overall probability. Given these factors, I would estimate a moderate probability for this question resolving as YES.

The target inflation rate for the Central Bank of Russia is 4% annually, which translates to about 0.33% monthly on average. While it's possible for monthly inflation to spike above 0.5%, it's not highly likely given the current trend and the bank's efforts to control it.

Technological advancements: Tesla's push for automation and AI could potentially lead to further reductions in human workforce requirements. Given these factors, there is a significant possibility that Tesla might announce additional layoffs. However, the initially reported 6% cut is already substantial, and Tesla may attempt to avoid further layoffs to maintain morale and public image.

(a) Tesla announcing additional layoffs beyond the initially reported 6% by August 2024: Tesla has already announced a 6% workforce reduction, which is significant. However, the tech industry and automotive sector are facing economic challenges, including high interest rates and potential recession fears. Tesla, despite its strong market position, is not immune to these pressures. The company has a history of making sudden decisions, and Elon Musk has been known to make unexpected moves.

This means rates would need to drop by approximately 0.5 to 0.8 percentage points to fall below 6.2%. 2. Federal Reserve policy: The Fed's monetary policy significantly influences mortgage rates. The Fed has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, but there are signs that they may slow or pause rate hikes in the near future. If inflation continues to cool, the Fed might even consider rate cuts by 2024. 3. Economic conditions: Factors such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation will play a role in determining mortgage rates. If the economy shows signs of slowing or entering a recession, this could lead to lower mortgage rates. 4. Housing market trends: A cooling housing market could prompt lenders to lower rates to stimulate demand. 5. Historical trends: Mortgage rates have been historically low in recent years, and while they've increased, there's potential for them to decrease again. 6.

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to good chance that mortgage rates could fall below 6.2% by August 2024. The Fed's potential pivot towards a less aggressive stance, combined with possible economic slowdown and the historical tendency for rates to fluctuate, suggests that a decrease in rates is quite possible within the given timeframe. However, there's still uncertainty, particularly regarding inflation and overall economic conditions. If inflation remains stubborn or if the economy proves more resilient than expected, rates might not decrease as much.

However, if a strike were to occur, there would be strong incentives for both parties to resolve it quickly. Let's estimate this probability at about 10%. 2. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the US falling below 6.2% by August 2024: As of June 2024, mortgage rates have been volatile but generally high due to the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation. The Fed has indicated it may begin cutting rates in 2024, which could lead to lower mortgage rates. However, the timing and extent of these cuts are uncertain. The mortgage market is also influenced by various economic factors beyond just the Fed's actions. Given that we have two months for rates to fall below 6.2%, and considering the potential for rate cuts and economic changes, this scenario seems more likely than the LG strike resolution. However, it's still not highly probable given the recent trend of elevated rates. Let's estimate this probability at about 30%.

Indiana is a predominantly conservative state, and its legislature has recently passed restrictive abortion laws. The likelihood of the state government initiating a referendum to enshrine abortion rights seems low.

Global energy trends: There's a growing global focus on clean energy sources to combat climate change. Nuclear energy, despite its controversies, is often considered a low-carbon option, which might encourage Russia to expand its nuclear capacity. 4. Existing plans: The question mentions two currently planned reactors. This suggests that Russia is already committed to expanding its nuclear capacity to some extent. 5. Timeframe: The announcement needs to be made by July 2024, which is about a year from now. This is a relatively short timeframe for planning major infrastructure projects like nuclear reactors. 6. Geopolitical considerations: Russia might see expanding its nuclear energy capacity as a way to assert its technological prowess and energy independence, especially in light of current geopolitical tensions. 7. Past behavior: Russia has a history of making ambitious announcements about energy projects, sometimes more for political impact than immediate implementation. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Russia will announce plans for additional reactors. The existing commitment to two new reactors suggests a willingness to expand nuclear capacity. The geopolitical situation and Russia's desire to showcase its technological capabilities might push them towards making such an announcement. However, the economic challenges and the relatively short timeframe are significant counterbalancing factors."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "a391d4b5-6a96-43e4-828f-f9be8939c416", "title": "Will either of the following occur by mid-2024: (a) Russia reports a successful winter crop season for wheat and barley, or (b) Russia announces plans to build additional nuclear reactors beyond the current two?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) By August 31, 2024, Russia reports a successful winter crop season for wheat and barley, characterized by yields meeting or exceeding the average of the past five years.

(a) Successful winter crop season for wheat and barley: Russia is one of the world's largest wheat exporters and has a significant agricultural sector. However, crop yields can be affected by various factors such as weather conditions, geopolitical situations, and agricultural policies. The requirement for success is quite specific: combined production of wheat and barley being at least 5% above the five-year average. While Russia has had good harvests in recent years, consistently exceeding the five-year average by 5% is challenging. Climate change and potential ongoing geopolitical tensions could impact agricultural output. However, Russia has been investing in agricultural technology and has a strong focus on food security, which could contribute to improved yields. (b) Announcement of plans to build additional nuclear reactors: Russia has a significant nuclear energy sector and has been actively promoting nuclear technology both domestically and internationally. The country has plans to increase its nuclear power capacity and has been working on developing new reactor designs. However, building nuclear reactors is a long-term, capital-intensive process that requires careful planning and significant resources. The current geopolitical situation and potential economic constraints might affect Russia's ability or willingness to commit to new nuclear projects beyond those already planned. On the other hand, Russia's push for energy independence and its desire to maintain its position as a leading nuclear technology provider could motivate such an announcement. Considering both scenarios: For (a), while possible, exceeding the five-year average by 5% is a relatively high bar, especially given potential climate and geopolitical uncertainties. For (b), Russia has a strong interest in nuclear energy, but economic and geopolitical factors might influence decision-making.

Google laying off at least 1,800 employees as part of its AI-focused reorganization plan: Google has been undergoing significant restructuring to focus more on AI. In January 2024, they already announced layoffs of around 1,000 employees across various departments. Given the rapid advancements in AI and the company's push towards AI integration, it's plausible that further layoffs could occur as part of this reorganization. However, the specific number (1,800) and the explicit link to the AI reorganization plan make this a more precise condition. While possible, it's not highly likely within the given timeframe. 2. South African Reserve Bank announcing an interest rate cut: The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has maintained high interest rates to combat inflation. As of early 2024, the repo rate stands at 8.25%. However, there are several factors that could lead to a rate cut by July 2024: - Inflation in South Africa has been showing signs of easing. - Global economic conditions, including potential rate cuts by major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, could influence SARB's decision. - Economic growth concerns in South Africa might prompt a more accommodative monetary policy.

(a) Pennsylvania receiving over $300 million in federal grants for electric vehicle projects: The Biden administration has been pushing for increased investment in electric vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing. Pennsylvania, being a key swing state with a strong manufacturing base, could be a prime candidate for such grants. However, $300 million is a significant amount, and while not impossible, it's a high bar to clear. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short, which reduces the likelihood.

However, labor tensions in the auto industry have been high recently, with strikes at other major automakers. The global trend towards electrification and automation in the auto industry could potentially lead to labor disputes. If a strike were to occur, there would be strong incentives for both Nissan and the workers to resolve it quickly due to the economic impact.

Considering these factors, the Netflix scenario seems more likely to occur within the given timeframe. Tech companies are often quick to adapt to new technologies, and AI is a rapidly growing field. Netflix, being a leader in streaming technology, has a strong incentive to bolster its AI capabilities. The Oregon grant scenario, while possible, faces more hurdles.

This is a relatively short period for implementing significant changes to advertising policies, especially for a large company like Facebook. 2. Antitrust concerns: The question mentions a federal court ruling related to antitrust concerns. Antitrust cases against big tech companies have been increasing in recent years, and Facebook (Meta) has been under scrutiny. 3. Facebook's history: Facebook has a history of facing regulatory challenges and has sometimes been required to make changes to its policies and practices. However, the company also has a track record of fighting legal battles and appealing decisions. 4. Implementation complexity: Changes to advertising policies, especially those related to targeting, pricing models, or advertiser agreements, can be complex and may require significant technical and operational adjustments. 5. Potential impact: Any changes to Facebook's advertising policies could have substantial financial implications for the company, which might incentivize them to implement changes quickly to avoid further legal issues. 6. Public pressure: There's ongoing public and regulatory pressure on social media platforms to improve their practices, which might encourage Facebook to comply promptly with court orders. 7. Lack of consideration for appeals: The question specifically states that appeals or stay orders are not considered, which increases the likelihood of implementation within the given timeframe. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high probability that Facebook will implement some court-ordered changes to its advertising policies by August 2024. The short timeframe is a limiting factor, but the exclusion of appeals and the potential severity of antitrust-related rulings make it more likely that Facebook would act quickly to comply. However, the complexity of implementing changes to a vast advertising system and Facebook's potential resistance to dramatic alterations in its business model introduce some uncertainty."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e9cd3daa-bcdb-4e7f-9552-ddb4f8674161", "title": "Will New York conduct a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, New York conducts a public referendum specifically focused on enshrining protection for abortion rights in the state.

Part A: Mercedes-Benz receiving over $500 million in U.S. grants for electric vehicle initiatives: The U.S. government has been pushing for increased electric vehicle adoption and production, which aligns with potential grants for Mercedes-Benz. However, $500 million is a significant amount, and such large grants are not common, especially for a single foreign automaker. Mercedes-Benz is already investing heavily in electric vehicles, which might make them a candidate for government support.

Part B: U.S. government initiating a new legal challenge against a renewable energy project: The U.S. has a complex regulatory environment for energy projects, and legal challenges are not uncommon. With the push for renewable energy, there may be conflicts between different stakeholders (e.g., environmental groups, local communities, energy companies) that could lead to legal challenges. The timeframe (by July 2024) provides ample opportunity for new projects to be proposed and potentially challenged.

However, they are not extremely common, especially for well-established brands with strong quality control measures. 3. Time frame: The question covers a relatively short period (about two months from the creation date to the resolution date). This reduces the likelihood of an outbreak occurring and being detected within this specific timeframe. 4. Food safety measures: Large companies like Hillshire Farm typically have robust food safety protocols in place to prevent contamination. However, no system is perfect, and contaminations can still occur. 5. Regulatory oversight: The FDA and USDA regularly inspect food processing facilities, which can help detect potential issues before they lead to outbreaks. This reduces the likelihood of a major contamination event. 6. Supply chain complexity: The more complex the supply chain, the higher the risk of contamination at some point. Hillshire Farm, being a large company, likely has a complex supply chain, which slightly increases the risk. 7. Seasonality: Listeria can grow at refrigeration temperatures, so seasonality is less of a factor compared to some other foodborne pathogens. However, summer months (which are included in the timeframe) can sometimes see slightly higher rates of food contamination due to warmer temperatures. Given these factors, while it's certainly possible for a listeria outbreak and subsequent recall to occur, it seems relatively unlikely within this specific timeframe for this particular company. Hillshire Farm has a good track record, and major listeria outbreaks are not extremely common in well-regulated food production environments. However, the risk is never zero, and the complexity of modern food production systems always leaves some possibility for contamination."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "b3d809fa-b699-4d98-bb46-6576fa2f29c5", "title": "Will the FDA issue a recall for ground ginger products due to lead contamination by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officially issues a recall for any ground ginger products due to lead contamination.

Recent concerns: There have been increasing concerns about heavy metal contamination in spices, including ginger, in recent years. Several studies have highlighted the potential for lead contamination in ginger and other spices. 3. Timeframe: The question gives a relatively short timeframe (about a month) for the FDA to issue a recall. This limits the probability, as the process of testing, confirming contamination, and issuing a recall can be time-consuming. 4. FDA's approach: The FDA typically issues recalls only when there's clear evidence of a health risk. They might first issue warnings or alerts before moving to a full recall. 5. Industry response: If there are concerns about lead contamination, some manufacturers might voluntarily recall their products before the FDA issues an official recall. 6. Testing frequency: The FDA doesn't test every batch of imported spices, so contamination might go undetected for some time. 7. Public awareness: Increased public awareness about food safety might lead to more testing and quicker action if contamination is found. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate but not high chance of a recall being issued in this timeframe. The short time window is the main limiting factor, as it doesn't allow much time for the detection, confirmation, and recall process.

Hillshire Farm sausage recall due to listeria by August 2024: Listeria outbreaks in processed meats are not uncommon, and sausages are particularly susceptible due to their production process. However, major brands like Hillshire Farm typically have stringent quality control measures in place. In recent years, there haven't been many high-profile listeria-related recalls from Hillshire Farm, which suggests their safety protocols are generally effective. Still, the risk is never zero. Given the 14-month timeframe, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 10-15%. 2. FDA recall of ground ginger products due to lead contamination by July 2024: Lead contamination in spices, particularly those imported from certain countries, has been an ongoing concern for the FDA. Ground ginger, being a commonly used spice, could potentially be affected. The FDA has issued recalls for various spices due to lead contamination in the past. Given the 13-month timeframe and the FDA's increased focus on food safety, especially regarding heavy metal contamination, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 20-25%. To calculate the overall probability, we need to consider that either of these events happening would result in a YES resolution. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Let's use the higher end of our estimates: P(A) = 0.15 (Hillshire Farm recall) P(B) = 0.25 (FDA ginger recall) P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.15 * 0.25 = 0.0375.

Recent announcements: Both Zoom and PayPal have announced AI-focused reorganization plans in 2023, which indicates they are actively pursuing AI integration. 3. Historical layoff patterns: Tech companies have been known to implement large-scale layoffs during reorganizations or economic downturns. 4. Timeframe: The question gives a relatively short timeframe (about a month) for these layoffs to occur, which reduces the likelihood. 5. Specific number: The threshold of 1,800 employees is quite high, especially for companies like Zoom and PayPal which are not among the largest tech giants. 6. Company sizes: As of 2023, Zoom had around 8,400 employees, while PayPal had about 29,900. Laying off 1,800 employees would represent a significant portion of their workforce (21% for Zoom, 6% for PayPal). 7.

As of now, these requirements have not been reinstated. Given the ongoing debates about the effectiveness and fairness of work requirements in Medicaid programs, and the fact that several states have already abandoned such requirements, there's a moderate chance Michigan might officially remove this requirement. However, it's important to note that this would likely require legislative action, which can be a slow process. The timeline of just over a year makes this somewhat less likely. b) Bank of Canada announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: The Bank of Canada, like many central banks, has been in a rate-hiking cycle to combat inflation. As of June 2023, the overnight rate stands at 4.75%. While the bank has signaled that it may pause rate hikes, it's still focused on bringing inflation down to its 2% target. The likelihood of a rate cut by August 2024 depends on how quickly inflation comes under control and whether economic conditions warrant monetary easing. Given the uncertain economic outlook and the time frame of over a year, there's a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. Combining these probabilities: For the question to resolve as YES, we only need one of these events to occur. This increases the overall likelihood.

Pedro S\u00e1nchez (Spain): Pedro S\u00e1nchez is currently the Prime Minister of Spain and has been in office since June 2018. He leads the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). Spain held general elections in July 2023, and S\u00e1nchez managed to form a government after complex negotiations. His current term is set to last until 2027 unless there's a snap election or a successful no-confidence motion. S\u00e1nchez has shown resilience in Spanish politics, surviving various challenges. The coalition he leads, while sometimes fragile, has managed to pass key legislation. Given that he has recently secured his position and there are no immediate threats to his leadership, it's more likely than not that he will remain in office through July 2024. 2. Boris Johnson (UK): Boris Johnson is no longer the Prime Minister of the UK. He resigned as Prime Minister in July 2022 and was succeeded by Liz Truss, who was then replaced by Rishi Sunak in October 2022. Johnson is currently a backbench MP but has left frontline politics. For Johnson to become Prime Minister again by July 2024, several unlikely events would need to occur: 1. A leadership challenge within the Conservative Party 2. Johnson winning such a challenge 3. The Conservative Party winning a general election (if one is called before July 2024) Given the current political climate in the UK and Johnson's diminished standing within his own party, the likelihood of him returning as Prime Minister by July 2024 is extremely low. Conclusion: The question resolves as YES if either S\u00e1nchez or Johnson remains in office. Given that S\u00e1nchez is currently in office and likely to remain so, while Johnson is out of office with very little chance of returning, the probability of this question resolving as YES is high. The outcome essentially depends on S\u00e1nchez remaining in office, which seems probable."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.029795677159333483, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.009931892386444494, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.23836564731139798, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current state of South Korea's digital payment landscape: South Korea is already a leader in digital payments and financial technology. The country has a high smartphone penetration rate and a tech-savvy population, which makes it a fertile ground for digital payment innovations. 2. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) efforts: The Bank of Korea has been actively researching and developing a CBDC. In 2021, they completed a mock test of the CBDC, and in 2022, they announced plans for further testing. This shows a clear interest in digital currency systems. 3. Global trends: Many central banks worldwide are exploring or implementing digital payment systems and CBDCs. This global trend might pressure South Korea to keep pace with international developments. 4. Timeframe: The question gives a deadline of August 2024, which is about 14 months from the creation date of the question. This is a reasonable timeframe for the development and announcement of a new digital payment system, especially given South Korea's technological capabilities. 5. Economic factors: The implementation of a new digital payment system could be seen as a way to boost economic efficiency and financial inclusion, which might be attractive to policymakers. 6. Potential challenges: Regulatory hurdles, cybersecurity concerns, and the need for extensive testing could potentially delay the announcement of a new system. 7. Previous announcements: The Bank of Korea has been transparent about its CBDC research and development process, suggesting they would likely announce a new system when ready. Considering these factors, I believe there is a good chance that the Central Bank of South Korea will announce a new digital payment system by August 2024. The country's technological readiness, ongoing CBDC efforts, and the global trend towards digital payment systems all point towards this outcome.

Central Bank of South Korea announcing a new digital payment system by August 2024: South Korea is known for its technological advancements and has been exploring digital payment systems. The country has been working on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot project. However, as of now, there's no clear indication that they are ready to launch a full-fledged system by August 2024. The timeline seems somewhat tight for a major financial infrastructure change. While it's possible, it's not highly probable given the complexities involved in implementing such systems. 2. Central Bank of Mexico announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024: This scenario seems more likely. Mexico's central bank has been maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation. As of 2023, the interest rate was at 11.25%. Typically, once inflation is under control, central banks tend to lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth. By July 2024, if inflation has been successfully managed, there's a good chance that the Bank of Mexico might consider an interest rate cut. However, this depends on various economic factors that are difficult to predict with certainty over a year in advance. Combining these scenarios, we have one that seems unlikely (South Korea's digital payment system) and another that seems more plausible (Mexico's interest rate cut).

Historical inflation trends in China: China has generally maintained relatively stable inflation rates in recent years. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) typically targets an inflation rate of around 3% annually. 2. Current economic conditions: China's economy has been facing challenges, including a property sector crisis and weak consumer spending. These factors have been putting downward pressure on inflation. 3. Time frame: The question covers a period from October 2023 to July 2024, which is a relatively short time frame for significant inflationary pressures to build up. 4. Threshold: The question asks about a month-over-month increase exceeding 0.5%, which is quite substantial for a single month. For context, a 0.5% monthly increase would translate to an annualized rate of about 6%, well above China's typical target. 5. Policy response: The PBOC has tools to control inflation and would likely take action if inflation showed signs of accelerating rapidly. 6. Global economic factors: While China's economy is large and somewhat insulated, global economic conditions and commodity prices can still impact inflation. Given these considerations, it seems unlikely that China's inflation would exceed 0.5% in a single month during the specified period. The PBOC has been more concerned with stimulating growth and combating deflationary pressures rather than controlling high inflation. For there to be such a significant monthly increase, there would need to be a major economic shock or policy change, which is not currently anticipated.

Central Bank of Indonesia announcing a new monetary easing policy: The Central Bank of Indonesia (Bank Indonesia) has been maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy to support the rupiah and control inflation.

Factors that could lead to monetary easing include: - Global economic slowdown - Decreasing inflation rates - Need to stimulate economic growth Given the timeframe (by August 2024), there's a moderate chance that economic conditions might necessitate an easing policy.

This suggests that it would be challenging for the Senate to pass a bill that the President explicitly opposes. 2. Time frame: The question asks about a period from now until August 2024, which is a relatively short time frame for a major economic reform bill to be proposed, debated, and passed, especially if it's opposed by the President. 3. Economic situation: Nigeria is facing significant economic challenges, including high inflation, currency devaluation, and fuel subsidy removal. This could potentially lead to proposals for economic reforms, but major changes are often slow to implement in Nigeria due to complex political dynamics. 4. Legislative independence: While the Senate is theoretically independent, in practice, it often aligns with the President's agenda, especially when the same party controls both branches. 5.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Nigeria's Senate would pass a major economic reform bill opposed by President Tinubu by August 2024. The alignment of the President's party with the Senate majority, the short time frame, and the historical tendency for legislative-executive cooperation on major economic matters all point towards a low probability of this event occurring.

In 2022, the state passed a law codifying the right to abortion. 3. Recent trends in abortion legislation: Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, many states have enacted stricter abortion laws. However, these laws have faced significant legal challenges, and several have been blocked or overturned by courts. 4. Time frame: The question asks about the ban being declared constitutional by August 2024, which is a relatively short time frame for a major constitutional issue to be fully resolved through the court system. 5. Colorado's judicial system: Colorado's state courts, including the Colorado Supreme Court, would be responsible for ruling on the constitutionality of the ban. The composition and historical rulings of these courts would be crucial in predicting the outcome. 6. Public opinion: Colorado's public opinion on abortion rights could influence the urgency and direction of court decisions. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Colorado's near-total abortion ban would be declared constitutional by August 2024: 1. The state's recent history of protecting abortion rights contradicts such a ban. 2. The short time frame makes it less likely for a full legal process to be completed. 3. The initial blocking of the ban suggests that there are significant legal challenges to its constitutionality. 4. The trend in many states has been for courts to block or overturn strict abortion bans. However, we must also consider the possibility of unexpected political or judicial shifts, or a surprisingly swift legal process. While these scenarios are less likely, they cannot be completely ruled out."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a453c56f-cad7-4fa6-82a6-977228b77b7a", "title": "Will Rhode Island maintain its red flag law through August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, as of August 31, 2024, Rhode Island continues to enforce a red flag law as part of its gun safety laws.

Current status: Rhode Island currently has a red flag law in place, which was enacted in 2018. This law allows courts to issue 'extreme risk protection orders' to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed to be at risk of harming themselves or others. 2. Political climate: Rhode Island is generally considered a politically liberal state, with Democrats holding a majority in both chambers of the state legislature and the governorship. This political environment is typically supportive of gun safety measures. 3. Public opinion: Red flag laws have generally received bipartisan support across the United States, with many viewing them as a reasonable measure to prevent gun violence while respecting Second Amendment rights. 4. Recent trends: There has been no significant movement or public discourse in Rhode Island aimed at repealing or substantially altering the red flag law. 5. National context: The trend across the United States has been towards maintaining or expanding red flag laws rather than repealing them, especially in states with Democratic majorities. 6. Time frame: The question asks about maintaining the law through August 2024, which is a relatively short time frame. Major legislative changes often take considerable time to enact. 7. Legal challenges: While some red flag laws have faced legal challenges in other states, Rhode Island's law has not faced any significant legal obstacles that threaten its existence. 8. Effectiveness: Studies have suggested that red flag laws can be effective in preventing gun violence, which provides an incentive for maintaining the law. Given these factors, it appears highly likely that Rhode Island will maintain its red flag law through August 2024. The state's political leanings, the general support for such laws, the absence of any significant opposition or repeal efforts, and the relatively short time frame all point towards the law remaining in place. The main risk factors that could lead to a repeal or significant alteration would be an unexpected shift in political power, a successful legal challenge, or unforeseen events that dramatically change public opinion on gun laws.

The near-total abortion ban that was blocked is likely a more recent attempt to restrict abortion rights. Given Colorado's political climate and recent history, it seems unlikely that a court would rule this ban constitutional.

In fact, as a member of the European Union, Spain generally follows the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, which focuses more on subsidies rather than export taxes. The likelihood of Spain implementing and then completely eliminating such taxes within a year seems very low. There's no current political discussion or economic pressure suggesting such a policy change. Probability for this condition: ~5%. b) United States reporting a bumper harvest for both corn and soybeans: This condition is more likely to occur. The US is a major producer of both corn and soybeans, and bumper harvests are not uncommon. However, achieving bumper harvests for both crops simultaneously is less frequent. Factors to consider: 1. Climate conditions: Weather patterns can significantly impact crop yields. Climate change has increased the unpredictability of weather, which could work both for and against bumper harvests. 2.

West Nile virus is endemic in many parts of the world, with seasonal outbreaks occurring in various regions, but it's not typically considered a global health emergency. 2. Nature of West Nile virus: West Nile virus is primarily spread by mosquitoes and is seasonal in nature, with peak transmission typically occurring during summer and early fall in temperate regions. The virus doesn't usually cause sustained person-to-person transmission, which makes it less likely to become a prolonged global health emergency. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a declaration by August 2024, which is only two months from the creation date of this question. This short timeframe makes it less likely for a major outbreak to both emerge and be resolved within this period. 4. WHO declaration practices: The WHO typically declares Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) for severe, sudden, unusual or unexpected outbreaks that pose a public health risk to other countries and potentially require a coordinated international response. West Nile virus outbreaks, while serious, have not historically met this threshold. 5.

It's not typically considered a global health emergency by the WHO in the same way as diseases like COVID-19. The WHO doesn't usually make formal declarations about the end of West Nile virus outbreaks. Instead, they monitor and report on its prevalence seasonally. Given this, it's highly unlikely that the WHO would make such a declaration by August 2024. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at less than 5%. b) Land O'Frost issuing a recall due to listeria by August 2024: Listeria outbreaks in deli meats are not uncommon. According to the CDC, deli meats are a known risk factor for listeria infections. Food recalls due to potential listeria contamination happen relatively frequently in the meat industry. Land O'Frost, being a major producer of deli meats, is at risk for such an event. However, it's important to note that food safety measures have improved over time, reducing the likelihood of contamination. Looking at historical data, major deli meat producers face recalls every few years. Land O'Frost has had recalls in the past, though not specifically for listeria in recent years. Given the timeframe of about 14 months until August 2024, and considering the frequency of listeria-related recalls in the industry, I'd estimate the probability of Land O'Frost issuing a listeria-related recall at around 20-25%.

Tennessee is a conservative state that has already implemented strict abortion laws. In 2022, Tennessee enacted a near-total abortion ban following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

In 2022, Governor Kim Reynolds asked the courts to reinstate the law following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. As of now, the law is still being challenged in court. Given the conservative majority in the Iowa Supreme Court and the current political climate in Iowa, it seems unlikely that the law will be overturned by July 2024. However, legal challenges can sometimes yield unexpected results, so we can't completely rule out this possibility. b) Colorado's abortion law being changed by August 2024: Colorado has one of the most permissive abortion laws in the United States, allowing abortions up to 22 weeks. The state has a history of protecting abortion rights, and in 2022, it codified the right to abortion into state law. Given the current political landscape in Colorado, with Democrats controlling both chambers of the state legislature and the governorship, it seems unlikely that the law will be changed to restrict abortion rights. However, there's a small possibility that the law could be changed to expand abortion rights even further, which would still count as a YES for this question. Considering both conditions: 1. The likelihood of Iowa's ban being overturned seems low, perhaps around 20%. 2. The chance of Colorado's law being changed also seems low, but slightly higher due to the possibility of expansion, perhaps around 25%. To resolve YES, either of these events needs to occur. Using the probability rule for independent events (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.20 + 0.25 - (0.20 * 0.25) = 0.45 - 0.05 = 0.40. This calculation suggests a 40% chance of the question resolving YES. However, given the current political climate and the relatively short timeframe (about 13 months from the question's creation date to the resolution date), I believe this might be slightly overestimating the likelihood of change. Therefore, I would adjust my final estimate downward slightly."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.307035561155527, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.10234518705184233, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.8380019039424886, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, inflation has been a concern, which typically discourages rate cuts. 2. Inflation trends: The RBI's primary mandate is to keep inflation within its target range of 2-6%. Recent data shows inflation has been moderating but still remains above the RBI's comfort zone. If this trend continues, it might create room for a rate cut. 3. Global economic factors: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, influence RBI's decisions. If global growth slows significantly, it might prompt the RBI to consider a rate cut to stimulate the economy. 4.

RBI's recent stance: The RBI has maintained a hawkish stance in recent meetings, focusing on controlling inflation. However, they have also indicated that they are data-dependent and will adjust policies as needed. 6. Potential for external shocks: Unforeseen events such as geopolitical tensions or commodity price spikes could influence the RBI's decision. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut by July 2024. The key will be how inflation trends develop over the next year. If inflation continues to moderate and falls comfortably within the RBI's target range, and if global economic conditions warrant support, the RBI might opt for a rate cut. However, the RBI is known for its cautious approach, and unless there's a clear need for monetary stimulus, they might prefer to hold rates steady."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "2a9f244b-e46b-4f14-bac5-03da4b98b450", "title": "Will Oracle announce measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by July 31, 2024, Oracle officially announces specific measures aimed at reducing electricity consumption attributed to its AI operations.

As of now (June 2023), the RBI has been maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy to combat inflation. However, by July 2024, which is more than a year away, the economic landscape could change significantly. If inflation comes under control and economic growth needs a boost, there's a possibility of a rate cut. However, given the current stance and the uncertainty of future economic conditions, the probability of a rate cut in this timeframe is moderate. b) Oracle announcing measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption: The tech industry, including major players like Oracle, is under increasing pressure to address the environmental impact of their operations, particularly in relation to AI. As AI becomes more prevalent and energy-intensive, companies are likely to face both regulatory and public pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Oracle, as a significant player in the cloud and AI space, has a vested interest in improving its energy efficiency. By July 2024, it's quite plausible that Oracle would announce such measures as part of their sustainability initiatives or in response to industry trends. Combining these factors: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs, which increases the overall probability.

Major platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are continuously developing and implementing AI systems for content moderation and recommendation. As these systems become more complex, the risk of unintended consequences, such as spreading misinformation, increases. Moreover, with the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaching, there will likely be heightened scrutiny on social media platforms and their role in information dissemination. This increased attention could lead to the discovery and reporting of AI-related misinformation issues. However, for this to occur, it would require not just the presence of misinformation, but also its detection and credible reporting by multiple authoritative sources. While possible, this adds an additional layer of uncertainty. (b) Nicolas Maduro condemning the attack on Maria Corina Machado's headquarters: This scenario seems less likely. Maduro has been in power since 2013 and has a history of suppressing opposition. Maria Corina Machado is a prominent opposition leader, and the attack on her headquarters in 2023 was likely seen as beneficial to Maduro's regime. For Maduro to publicly condemn this attack would represent a significant shift in his political stance. Such a dramatic change seems unlikely given his past behavior and the current political climate in Venezuela. Moreover, this condemnation would need to occur within a specific timeframe and be reported by multiple reputable international news sources, adding further constraints. Considering both scenarios, (a) seems more likely to occur than (b). The rapid development of AI technology, coupled with the upcoming U.S. election and ongoing concerns about misinformation, makes the first scenario a real possibility. The second scenario, while not impossible, would require a dramatic and unexpected shift in Venezuelan politics. Given these factors, I would estimate that there's a moderate chance of at least one of these events occurring by August 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This narrows down the possibilities significantly, as the NEA might not necessarily hold a major event in Illinois during this short timeframe. 5. Biden's schedule: As the incumbent president running for re-election, Biden's schedule will be packed with campaign events, official duties, and other commitments.

California receiving over $300 million in federal grants for electric vehicle projects by July 2024: - California is a leader in electric vehicle adoption and has a strong focus on clean energy. - The federal government, under Biden's administration, has been pushing for increased EV adoption and infrastructure. - $300 million is a significant amount, but not unreasonable for large-scale EV projects. - The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act have allocated substantial funds for such initiatives. - California, being a large state with a strong green agenda, is likely to be a prime candidate for such grants. - The timeframe (about a month) is short, but not impossible for grant announcements. - This condition seems more likely, perhaps around 60-70% chance.

While specific numbers weren't initially disclosed, layoffs in tech companies, especially during reorganizations, are common. IBM has a history of periodic workforce reductions, and with the shift towards AI, it's plausible that some roles may become redundant. However, 1,800 employees is a significant number, and IBM might try to retrain or reassign employees rather than conduct large-scale layoffs. Given the timeframe (by July 2024) and the ongoing AI transformation in the tech industry, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%.

However, the state has also shown a tendency to modify or repeal such laws due to public pressure and economic consequences. The current political climate in the US is seeing increased debate and legislation around transgender rights, particularly for youth. Given that: 1.

Global economic trends: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, can influence Chile's monetary policy decisions. 3. Time frame: The question gives a window of about 14 months from the creation date to the resolution date, which is a significant period in economic terms. 4. Historical context: Central banks typically move interest rates gradually, and it's not uncommon for rate cut cycles to follow rate hike cycles once inflation is under control. 5. Inflation targets: The Central Bank of Chile's primary mandate is price stability. If inflation shows signs of moderating, it could pave the way for rate cuts. 6. Economic growth: If Chile's economic growth slows significantly, it could prompt the central bank to cut rates to stimulate the economy. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance of a rate cut by August 2024. Here's why: - The extended time frame (14 months) provides ample opportunity for economic conditions to evolve, potentially allowing inflation to moderate and creating room for rate cuts. - Global economic conditions may shift, with major central banks potentially easing their monetary policies, which could influence Chile's decisions. - If inflation in Chile shows signs of coming under control, the central bank may pivot to supporting economic growth through rate cuts. - Historical patterns suggest that after a period of rate hikes to combat inflation, central banks often begin to cut rates once inflation is contained. However, there are also factors that could prevent a rate cut: - If inflation remains persistently high, the central bank may need to maintain higher rates for longer. - Unexpected economic shocks or global crises could alter the economic landscape.

Economic conditions: The overall state of the economy, including factors like inflation rates, unemployment, and GDP growth, can significantly impact housing demand. Any sudden economic shifts could affect home sales. 3. Interest rates: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy and interest rate decisions play a crucial role in the housing market. If interest rates are high or rising, it could dampen home buying activity. 4. Seasonal patterns: While the question asks for seasonally adjusted rates, there might still be some residual seasonal effects that could influence month-to-month changes. 5. Housing supply: The availability of homes on the market can affect sales numbers. A shortage of inventory could lead to decreased sales, even if demand remains high. 6. Consumer confidence: If there's uncertainty about the economy or job market, potential buyers might delay their purchases, leading to a decline in sales. 7.

The timeframe given (by August 2024) is over a year away, which provides ample time for economic conditions to change. Given the global trend towards monetary easing as inflation pressures subside, there's a reasonable chance that Chile might reduce rates by then.

While there are risks such as global economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions, the likelihood of India experiencing two consecutive quarters of negative growth seems low. The country's large domestic market, growing middle class, and government initiatives to boost economic growth provide a buffer against a recession.

This is a considerable amount of time for further improvements in the global situation. 3. Vaccination progress: Global vaccination efforts continue, with many countries achieving high vaccination rates. This contributes to reducing the severity and spread of the virus. 4. Virus evolution: While new variants may emerge, the global population has built up significant immunity through vaccination and prior infections, potentially reducing the impact of future variants. 5.

However, there are also factors that could delay such a declaration: 1. Potential new variants: The virus could mutate into more concerning variants, prolonging the outbreak status. 2. Uneven global progress: Some regions may continue to struggle with the virus, potentially delaying a global 'end' declaration. 3.

Polio status in Bahrain: Bahrain, like many countries in the Middle East, has been polio-free for decades. The last reported case of polio in Bahrain was in 1994. 2. Global polio eradication efforts: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has made significant progress, with wild poliovirus now endemic in only two countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan). 3. Vaccination rates: Bahrain has a robust healthcare system and high vaccination rates. According to WHO data, the coverage of polio vaccination in Bahrain has consistently been above 95% in recent years. 4. Sanitation and hygiene: Manama, being the capital and largest city of Bahrain, likely has good sanitation and hygiene standards, which helps prevent the spread of polio. 5. Surveillance systems: Bahrain likely has a strong disease surveillance system in place, which would quickly detect and respond to any polio cases. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a relatively short time frame (until August 2024), which reduces the likelihood of multiple cases occurring and being confirmed within this period. 7. Specificity of location: The question specifically asks about cases in Manama, not the entire country, which further reduces the probability. 8.

Given these factors, the probability of more than one case of polio being confirmed in Manama by August 2024 is very low. While it's not impossible, it would require a significant breakdown in vaccination efforts, introduction of the virus from outside, and multiple transmission events within a short time frame in a specific location. The main risk factors that could slightly increase the probability are potential lapses in vaccination due to disruptions caused by global events (like the COVID-19 pandemic), or the introduction of the virus through international travel.

The WHO declaring the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak over: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been ongoing since early 2020. While many countries have lifted restrictions and adapted to living with the virus, the WHO has not yet declared the outbreak over. The WHO is typically cautious about such declarations, as seen with previous outbreaks. Given that the question is set to resolve by August 2024, which is still over a year away, there is a possibility that the situation could improve significantly. However, the emergence of new variants and ongoing challenges in global vaccination efforts make it uncertain whether the WHO will feel confident enough to declare the outbreak over by then. 2. The Bahraini health ministry confirming more than one case of polio in Manama: Polio has been largely eradicated in most parts of the world, including Bahrain. The country has maintained its polio-free status for many years. However, the possibility of polio cases emerging is not zero, especially considering potential gaps in vaccination coverage or the introduction of the virus from other regions. That said, for this condition to be met, there would need to be multiple cases confirmed specifically in Manama, which is a relatively small and specific area. This makes the likelihood of this event quite low. Considering both events: - The first event (WHO declaring the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak over) seems more likely than the second, but still uncertain. - The second event (multiple polio cases in Manama) is highly unlikely given Bahrain's current health status and the specific conditions required. Given that only one of these events needs to occur for the question to resolve as YES, we need to consider the combined probability.

However, it's important to note that Brazil has been showing resilience in job creation, and the government is likely to implement policies to maintain job growth above this threshold.

Chile's inflation has been decreasing, which could prompt the central bank to consider rate cuts.

This would only happen if Biden decided not to run for re-election or if he were to step down for some reason. While there has been speculation about Biden's age and health, he has consistently stated his intention to run for re-election. 3.

Typically, running mates are announced in July or early August. 4. Location specificity: The question requires the announcement to be made at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. While Charlotte is a significant city in a swing state, there's no particular reason why it would be chosen over other locations for such an important announcement. 5.

Recent legislative actions: In January 2023, Minnesota passed the PRO Act, which codified abortion rights into state law. This indicates that there is already strong support for abortion rights in the state government. 3. Constitutional amendments: Putting abortion rights into the state constitution would provide stronger protection than statutory law. However, the process for amending the Minnesota constitution requires a proposal to be passed by both houses of the legislature and then approved by voters in a general election. 4. Timing: The next general election in Minnesota is in November 2024, which is after the August 2024 deadline specified in the question. This makes it unlikely that a constitutional amendment referendum would be held before August 2024. 5.

The state might prefer to follow the normal constitutional amendment process, which would likely occur in November 2024 or later. 6. Precedent: While some states have held special referendums on abortion rights, these have often been in response to more restrictive laws or court decisions. Minnesota's situation is different, as abortion rights are currently protected. 7. Resource allocation: Holding a special referendum requires significant resources and planning. With abortion rights already protected by law, the state government might prioritize other issues.

The key reasons for this assessment are: - Inflation is likely to continue its downward trend, potentially approaching the 2% target by mid-2024. - If economic growth in the Eurozone remains sluggish, there may be pressure on the ECB to stimulate the economy through rate cuts. - The ECB will have had time to observe the effects of their previous rate hikes and may feel confident in reversing course if inflation is under control. However, there are also reasons to be cautious about predicting a rate cut: - The ECB may want to ensure inflation is firmly under control before cutting rates. - There's a possibility that inflation could prove more persistent than expected. - The ECB might choose to hold rates steady for an extended period rather than cutting them quickly.

Another U.S. state adopting a Medicaid plan with a health savings account requirement by July 2024: This scenario is more plausible. Several states have been experimenting with different Medicaid models in recent years. Health savings account requirements in Medicaid plans are part of a broader trend towards consumer-directed healthcare. However, such plans are controversial and face potential legal challenges. Georgia has already implemented such a plan, which suggests other states might follow suit. States with Republican-led governments might be more likely to adopt such plans. However, the timeline is quite short (about a month from now), which reduces the likelihood of a state fully adopting and announcing such a plan by the deadline.

Recent abortion legislation: In April 2022, Florida passed a law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which was later upheld by the state Supreme Court. This indicates a trend towards restricting rather than protecting abortion rights. 3. Grassroots movements: There have been efforts by abortion rights advocates to gather signatures for a ballot initiative to protect abortion rights in the state constitution. However, as of now, there's no indication that they have gathered enough signatures or that such an initiative has been officially approved for a referendum. 4. Time constraints: The question specifies August 2024 as the deadline. Organizing a statewide referendum requires significant time for planning, approval, and implementation. With just over a year left, the timeline is tight. 5. Historical precedent: Florida has not held a statewide referendum specifically on abortion rights in recent history, which suggests this would be an unusual occurrence. 6. National context: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, these have primarily been in more politically liberal states. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Florida will hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. The current political leadership is not inclined to support such a measure, and while grassroots efforts exist, they have not yet gained enough traction to force a referendum. The tight timeline further reduces the likelihood. However, it's not entirely impossible. Public opinion shifts, unexpected political changes, or successful grassroots campaigns could potentially lead to a referendum, albeit with a low probability."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "50b1b475-76e7-42e8-87ac-0528e6606ec4", "title": "Will New Jersey hold a referendum on police reform by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the state of New Jersey officially conducts a referendum regarding police reform.

Part A: Indiana's near-total abortion ban being declared constitutional - The current political climate in the United States is highly divided on abortion rights, with conservative states pushing for stricter laws. Indiana has a Republican-controlled legislature and a conservative-leaning judiciary, which increases the likelihood of the ban being upheld. However, such bans have faced significant legal challenges in other states, and courts have often blocked or overturned them. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has created a new legal landscape, potentially making it easier for states to enforce stricter abortion laws. Given the timeframe (by August 2024), there is a moderate chance that the case could reach a final decision in an Indiana state court. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of this part occurring at around 40%. Part B: Kamala Harris announcing her running mate at a rally in San Francisco - As of now (June 2024), Kamala Harris is the sitting Vice President and is expected to run alongside President Biden for re-election in 2024. It is highly unusual for a sitting Vice President to choose their own running mate, as this role is typically filled by the presidential candidate. The scenario described would only be plausible if Harris were running for President herself, which is extremely unlikely given Biden's presumed candidacy. Even if Harris were to run for President, announcing a running mate at a rally in San Francisco by August 2024 would be very early in the election cycle and not in line with typical campaign strategies.

The country's GDP grew by 1.4% in Q1 2023 compared to the previous quarter, indicating a positive trend. 2. Export-driven economy: South Korea's economy is heavily dependent on exports, particularly in sectors like semiconductors, automobiles, and electronics. The global demand for these products, especially semiconductors, has been recovering, which bodes well for the Korean economy. 3. Government policies: The South Korean government has been implementing various stimulus measures and economic policies to support growth and prevent a recession. These include fiscal spending, monetary policies, and support for key industries. 4. Global economic conditions: The global economic outlook for 2023-2024 remains uncertain due to factors like inflation, geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many forecasts suggest a gradual improvement in the global economy, which would benefit South Korea's export-oriented economy. 5. Domestic consumption: South Korea's domestic consumption has been showing signs of recovery, which helps to balance the economy and reduce its vulnerability to external shocks. 6. Historical performance: South Korea has demonstrated resilience in the face of economic challenges in the past, often avoiding recessions when other developed economies struggled. 7. Time frame: The question covers a period from October 2023 to July 2024, which is relatively short. This shorter timeframe makes it less likely for two consecutive quarters of negative growth to occur, especially given the current positive trajectory.

Current status of the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria: As of now (June 2023), Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and several other West African countries. However, it's not currently classified as a global emergency by the WHO. The WHO has not declared it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 2. Historical context: Lassa fever outbreaks occur annually in Nigeria, with the peak season typically between December and April. The country has been managing these outbreaks for years, and while they can be severe, they haven't escalated to global emergency status. 3. Time frame: The question asks about the status by August 2024, which is more than a year away. This provides ample time for potential changes in the outbreak's status or for implementing more effective control measures. 4. WHO's criteria for global emergencies: The WHO declares a PHEIC when an event constitutes a public health risk to other countries through international spread and potentially requires a coordinated international response. Lassa fever, while serious, has not met these criteria in the past. 5. Nigeria's healthcare capacity: Nigeria has experience in managing Lassa fever outbreaks and has been working to improve its response capabilities. This ongoing effort reduces the likelihood of the outbreak escalating to a global emergency status. 6. Potential for vaccine development: Research is ongoing for Lassa fever vaccines, and while it's unlikely a widely available vaccine will be ready by August 2024, progress in this area could contribute to better control of the disease. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the WHO would declare the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria a global emergency between now and August 2024. Therefore, there's a very low probability that they would need to declare it 'no longer a global emergency' by the resolution date.

The automotive industry is currently undergoing significant changes with the shift towards electric vehicles and increased focus on sustainability. Hyundai has been investing heavily in these areas, which could potentially lead to increased sales and profitability. However, the automotive industry is also facing challenges such as supply chain disruptions and economic uncertainties. A 20% increase in net income is a significant jump, but it's not unprecedented for a company of Hyundai's size and in its industry. Given the timeframe (by July 2024), Hyundai has multiple quarters to achieve this target.

However, France has a diverse and resilient economy, and the government has been implementing measures to support economic growth. The European Central Bank's monetary policies also play a role in supporting the Eurozone economies. While there are risks, France has shown the ability to navigate economic challenges in the past. The timeframe (October 2023 to July 2024) is relatively short, which reduces the likelihood of two consecutive quarters of negative growth. I'd estimate the probability of France avoiding a recession during this period at around 70%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs.

As of mid-2023, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which typically leads to higher mortgage rates and can dampen home sales. However, the housing market has shown resilience in the face of these challenges.

However, it has also faced challenges recently due to rising interest rates and affordability issues. The Bank of Canada's monetary policy, similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve, has been tightening to control inflation. This could put downward pressure on home prices.

(a) Uber layoffs: Uber announced an AI-focused reorganization plan in 2023, which suggests that significant changes are coming to the company. However, laying off 1,800 employees is a substantial move that would represent a significant portion of Uber's workforce. As of 2023, Uber had approximately 32,000 employees worldwide. A layoff of 1,800 would be about 5.6% of their workforce, which is significant but not unprecedented in tech industry reorganizations. Factors to consider: 1. Tech companies have been going through layoffs in recent years due to economic pressures and shifts in strategy. 2. AI implementation often leads to job displacement, especially in roles that can be automated. 3. Uber has a history of making bold moves to streamline operations and cut costs. 4. The timeline (by July 31, 2024) gives Uber more than a year to implement these changes, which is a reasonable timeframe for a major reorganization. However, the specific number (1,800) and the explicit link to the AI reorganization make this a relatively precise prediction, which lowers the probability somewhat. (b) UK House of Lords passing a major economic reform bill opposed by PM Sunak: This scenario is less likely for several reasons: 1. The House of Lords has limited powers to pass legislation against the will of the government. While they can delay and amend bills, they generally cannot force through legislation opposed by the Prime Minister. 2. Major economic reforms typically originate in the House of Commons, not the Lords. 3. The Conservative Party currently has a majority in the House of Commons, making it unlikely that a bill strongly opposed by the Prime Minister would pass. 4. The House of Lords is traditionally more cautious about challenging the government on major economic issues. However, factors that could increase the likelihood include: 1. Potential political instability or a change in government before August 2024. 2. Growing economic pressures that could lead to cross-party support for reforms. 3. The possibility of a compromise bill that Sunak initially opposes but later accepts with modifications. Combining the probabilities: The Uber layoff scenario seems more likely than the UK political scenario. Given the tech industry trends and Uber's history, I would estimate the probability of the Uber layoffs at around 30-35%. The UK political scenario is much less likely, perhaps around 10-15%. Since only one of these needs to occur for a YES resolution, we need to calculate the probability of at least one event occurring.

However, the state government is currently controlled by Republicans who are generally less likely to initiate pro-abortion rights measures. 2. Recent abortion-related developments: In 2022, Arizona's pre-statehood abortion ban from 1864 was temporarily reinstated, causing significant controversy. This has led to increased activism and calls for protecting abortion rights in the state. 3. Timeframe: The question specifies a deadline of August 2024, which is about 14 months from now.

However, this process requires significant time and resources to gather enough signatures and navigate legal challenges. 5. National trends: Several states have held referendums on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which might influence Arizona to follow suit. 6.

Arizona abortion rights referendum: - Arizona has been a battleground state for abortion rights, with recent legal challenges to abortion restrictions. - There's been growing activism around abortion rights in Arizona, which could potentially lead to a push for a referendum. - The timeframe (by August 2024) allows for some time to organize a referendum, but it's still a relatively short period.

The short timeframe (about 14 months from the question's creation date to the resolution date) makes it challenging to initiate and complete a referendum process if it's not already underway.

Georgia holding a referendum on voting rights: The likelihood of this happening seems low. Georgia has not recently indicated any plans to hold such a referendum. The state has been involved in controversies regarding voting rights, but these have typically been addressed through legislation rather than constitutional amendments. Additionally, the timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for organizing a state-wide referendum on a constitutional matter. Such processes typically require significant planning, legislative approval, and public debate. 2. Arkansas Senate passing a total abortion ban: This scenario is more plausible. Arkansas already has strict abortion laws, and there's a history of conservative states pushing for increasingly restrictive legislation. However, Arkansas already passed a near-total abortion ban in 2021, which was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Given this existing legislation, it's less likely that the Arkansas Senate would pass another total ban within the given timeframe, unless there are significant changes in the legal landscape or political pressure. Combining these factors: - The Georgia referendum seems unlikely (let's estimate around 10% chance). - The Arkansas abortion ban, while more plausible, is still not highly likely given the existing legislation (let's estimate around 20% chance).

(a) U.S. Senate passing a bill to cut the Department of Education's budget by more than 20%: This scenario is highly unlikely for several reasons: 1. Education is a priority for many Americans, and such a drastic cut would face significant public opposition. 2. The current political climate does not suggest a strong push for major education budget cuts. 3. Even if proposed, such a significant cut would likely face strong opposition in the Senate, making it difficult to pass. 4. Historical trends show that drastic budget cuts to major departments are rare. The probability of this occurring is very low, estimated at around 5%. (b) Stanford University fully covering tuition for undergraduate students from lower-income families: This scenario is more plausible: 1. Many top universities have been expanding their financial aid programs in recent years. 2. Stanford already has a generous financial aid program, covering tuition for families earning less than $150,000 annually. 3. There's increasing pressure on elite universities to improve accessibility and affordability. 4. Stanford has the financial resources to implement such a policy. However, the specific threshold of $100,000 and the requirement for 'full' coverage make this less likely. The probability of this occurring is moderate, estimated at around 30%.

Current situation: As of now (June 2024), there is no widespread strike of airline mechanics in the US. Major airlines have not reported any ongoing labor disputes with their mechanics. 2. Historical context: Strikes in the airline industry, especially among mechanics, are relatively rare and usually don't last for extended periods. The last major airline mechanics strike in the US was in 2005 with Northwest Airlines, which lasted for about two weeks. 3. Labor relations: Airlines and unions generally try to avoid long-term strikes due to the significant economic impact on both parties. They often engage in negotiations and mediation to resolve disputes before resorting to strikes. 4. Time frame: The question asks about a strike lasting through August 2024, which is only two months from the creation date of this question. For a strike to last that long, it would need to start very soon and be unusually protracted. 5. Economic factors: The airline industry is sensitive to disruptions, and a prolonged strike would be extremely costly for both the airlines and the workers. This creates a strong incentive for both sides to reach an agreement quickly. 6. Regulatory environment: The US government, through the National Mediation Board, often intervenes in airline labor disputes to prevent or end strikes that could significantly disrupt air travel. 7. Lack of current indicators: There are no current signs of imminent large-scale labor unrest among airline mechanics in the US that would suggest a strike is likely to occur and persist through August 2024. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that a strike of US airline mechanics would begin and then persist through August 2024. While labor disputes can arise unexpectedly, the short time frame and the rarity of prolonged strikes in this sector make it improbable."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "3b103a98-8cfe-4966-930c-9943f182ab6c", "title": "Will Massachusetts hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, Massachusetts holds a public referendum specifically focused on enshrining protection for abortion rights in the state constitution or law.

Lack of current public discussion: As of now, there doesn't seem to be widespread public discussion or political momentum for such a referendum in Massachusetts. 6. Comparison to other states: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights in recent years, these have often been in response to more restrictive laws or threats to existing protections. Massachusetts' strong existing protections might make this less likely. 7.

While labor disputes in the airline industry are not uncommon, strikes of this duration (lasting over two months) are relatively rare. Airlines and unions typically try to resolve issues before they escalate to such prolonged strikes due to the significant economic impact on both parties.

However, there has been increased activity nationwide to codify abortion rights at the state level following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. As of now, there are no concrete plans for such a referendum in Massachusetts by August 2024. The process of getting a referendum on the ballot typically requires significant time for signature gathering and legislative procedures. Considering both scenarios: 1.

However, without specific information about Columbus Craft Meats' past recall history, we can't assume they are more or less likely than other companies to face this issue. 2. Food safety measures: Reputable meat processing companies typically have strict food safety protocols in place to prevent bacterial contamination. Columbus Craft Meats, being a well-known brand, likely has such measures. However, no system is perfect, and contaminations can still occur. 3. Time frame: The question covers a period of about two months (from the creation date to the resolution date). This is a relatively short time frame, which reduces the likelihood of a specific outbreak occurring and being detected within this period. 4. Listeria characteristics: Listeria is a persistent bacteria that can survive in cold environments, making it a particular concern for ready-to-eat meats. However, its long incubation period (up to 70 days) means that outbreaks are often difficult to trace quickly. 5. Regulatory oversight: The meat industry is heavily regulated, with frequent inspections. This reduces the risk of contamination but also increases the likelihood of detection if contamination does occur. 6. Company size and distribution: As a larger company, Columbus Craft Meats likely has a wide distribution network. This could potentially increase the risk of contamination at some point in the supply chain, but also means they likely have more resources dedicated to quality control. 7. Recall threshold: Companies and regulatory bodies typically err on the side of caution when it comes to food safety. Even a small risk of contamination could trigger a recall. Considering these factors, while it's certainly possible for a listeria outbreak to occur and be detected within this timeframe, it's not highly probable. The food safety measures in place, combined with the short time frame, make it more likely that no such recall will be necessary. However, the seriousness of listeria contamination and the cautious approach to food safety mean that the probability isn't negligible."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "8fed168c-601b-4b3c-82f9-6acb7d7bb344", "title": "Will the FDA issue a recall for ground coriander products due to lead contamination by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officially issues a recall for any ground coriander products due to lead contamination.

Time frame: The question gives a relatively short time frame (about one month) for this specific recall to occur. This reduces the likelihood somewhat, as investigations and testing can take time. 3. Frequency of lead contamination in spices: Lead contamination in spices is a known issue, with coriander being one of the spices that has been found to contain elevated lead levels in some cases. 4. FDA's focus on food safety: The FDA regularly monitors and tests food products for contaminants, including heavy metals like lead. 5. Recent incidents or reports: As of the creation date of this question (June 30, 2024), there's no mention of any ongoing investigation or recent reports of lead contamination in ground coriander. If there were, it would significantly increase the probability. 6. Specificity of the product: The question specifically asks about ground coriander, not coriander in general or other spices. This narrows the scope and reduces the probability. 7. Recall threshold: The FDA issues recalls when contamination levels pose a significant health risk. The lead levels would need to be high enough to warrant a recall, not just a warning or alert. Given these factors, while it's certainly possible for the FDA to issue a recall for ground coriander due to lead contamination, the probability of it happening within this specific one-month timeframe is relatively low.

Columbus Craft Meats salami recall due to listeria by August 2024: Listeria outbreaks in ready-to-eat meat products like salami are not uncommon. However, major meat producers typically have strict quality control measures in place. Columbus Craft Meats is a well-established brand, which suggests they likely have good safety protocols. That said, no system is perfect, and recalls do happen in the industry. The timeframe (about 14 months from now) is relatively long, which increases the chance of an incident occurring. However, listeria outbreaks severe enough to warrant a recall are still relatively rare events. I'd estimate the probability of this scenario at around 10-15%. 2. FDA recall of ground coriander due to lead contamination by July 2024: Lead contamination in spices, particularly those imported from certain countries, has been a recurring issue. Coriander is widely used and often imported, which increases the risk. The FDA regularly tests for heavy metals in food products and has issued recalls for lead contamination in spices before. The timeframe for this scenario (about 13 months) is also substantial, allowing for multiple testing cycles and potential discoveries of contamination. Given the history of similar recalls and the timeframe, I'd estimate the probability of this scenario at around 20-25%. Combining probabilities: Since we need only one of these events to occur for a YES resolution, we need to calculate the probability of at least one event occurring.

Historical context: Indiana expanded Medicaid in 2015 under the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0. By 2021, over 572,000 individuals were enrolled in the program. This shows that Indiana has experience with Medicaid expansion and has achieved significant enrollment numbers in the past. 2. Population and potential eligibility: Indiana has a population of about 6.8 million people. The Medicaid expansion typically targets adults aged 19-64 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.

Time frame: The question asks about enrollment by July 2024, which is about a month after the question was created. This suggests that the expansion program may have already been in progress or is about to begin. The short timeframe could be challenging for reaching 200,000 enrollees, especially if it's a new expansion initiative. 4. Outreach and enrollment efforts: The success of reaching 200,000 enrollees largely depends on the state's outreach efforts, the ease of the enrollment process, and public awareness of the program. 5. Political climate: Indiana has a Republican-controlled state government, which historically has been less supportive of Medicaid expansion. However, the fact that an expansion program exists suggests some level of political support. 6. COVID-19 impact: The pandemic may have increased the number of people eligible for Medicaid due to job losses and economic hardship, potentially increasing enrollment. 7. Unwinding of the Public Health Emergency (PHE): The end of the PHE in 2023 led to Medicaid eligibility redeterminations across the country. This could result in some people losing coverage, but also potentially increase awareness and new enrollments in expansion programs. Given these factors, it seems possible but not certain that Indiana could reach 200,000 enrollees by July 2024.

Organizing a statewide referendum typically requires significant planning and legislative action, which may be difficult to accomplish in this timeframe. 3. Recent developments: In April 2023, Wisconsin voters elected a liberal justice to the state Supreme Court, potentially shifting the balance on abortion-related issues. This could influence the urgency or perceived need for a constitutional referendum. 4. Existing abortion laws: Wisconsin currently has a pre-Roe v.

National trends: Several states have held referendums on abortion rights since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which could inspire similar action in Wisconsin. However, many of these states had mechanisms for citizen-initiated referendums, which Wisconsin does not have. 6. Legislative process: In Wisconsin, to amend the state constitution, a proposed amendment must pass both houses of the legislature in two consecutive sessions and then be approved by voters in a referendum. This process is lengthy and would be challenging to complete by July 2024. 7. Public opinion: While there is significant public support for abortion rights in Wisconsin, translating this into a constitutional referendum requires political will and agreement across party lines. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Wisconsin will hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024.

However, there's growing recognition of nuclear power's role in achieving clean energy goals. The current administration has shown support for nuclear energy, but primarily through maintaining existing plants and developing advanced reactor technologies.

Specificity of the requirement: The question specifically requires a 72-hour waiting period, not just any waiting period. This narrows the possibilities. 7. Public opinion: Polls generally show majority support for waiting periods, which could influence lawmakers. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of another state implementing a 72-hour waiting period by August 2024. States with Democratic-controlled legislatures and a history of passing gun control measures (such as California, New York, or Illinois) are the most likely candidates. However, the specific requirement for a 72-hour period (not longer or shorter) reduces the probability somewhat. The main factors working against this outcome are the strong opposition from gun rights groups and the specific 72-hour requirement. Many states might opt for different waiting periods if they decide to implement one.

(a) Implementation of a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases in another U.S. state: Gun control is a contentious issue in the U.S., with some states pushing for stricter measures while others resist such changes. As of now, only a handful of states have implemented waiting periods for gun purchases, and even fewer have specifically 72-hour waiting periods. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for significant legislative changes, especially on such a controversial topic. However, public sentiment around gun control can shift rapidly in response to high-profile incidents, which could prompt quick legislative action.

(b) New York conducting a referendum on abortion rights: New York already has strong abortion protections in place, having passed the Reproductive Health Act in 2019. While some states are actively working to enshrine abortion rights in their constitutions following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, New York's existing protections might reduce the urgency for a referendum. However, there's a growing trend of states seeking to further solidify abortion rights through constitutional amendments or referendums. New York is a predominantly Democrat-controlled state, which increases the likelihood of such a measure being proposed. The timeframe (by August 2024) allows for sufficient time to organize and conduct a referendum. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of this occurring at about 30%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.20 + 0.30 - (0.20 * 0.30) = 0.50 - 0.06 = 0.44.

Current legal situation: Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of FTX, is already facing numerous legal challenges related to the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange. He has been indicted on multiple charges, including fraud and money laundering. 2. Existing bankruptcy proceedings: FTX and its affiliated companies are already undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. These existing proceedings may complicate or delay any new personal bankruptcy filings. 3. Asset seizure and forfeiture: Given the ongoing criminal proceedings, it's likely that many of Bankman-Fried's assets have been or will be seized or frozen by authorities. This could potentially leave him with limited personal assets to protect through bankruptcy. 4. Creditor actions: While many creditors are likely focusing on recovering funds through the FTX bankruptcy proceedings, some may choose to pursue Bankman-Fried personally. However, given the existing legal actions, creditors might wait for the outcome of criminal proceedings before initiating new bankruptcy cases. 5. Time frame: The question asks about new proceedings by July 2024, which is about a year from now. This is a relatively short time frame, considering the complexity of the ongoing legal matters. 6. Personal choice: Bankman-Fried might choose to file for personal bankruptcy to protect any remaining assets, but this would depend on his personal financial situation and legal strategy. 7. Outcome of current proceedings: The result of the ongoing criminal and civil cases could significantly impact the likelihood of new bankruptcy proceedings. If Bankman-Fried is convicted and faces significant fines or restitution orders, it could potentially trigger bankruptcy proceedings. Given these factors, I believe the probability of new bankruptcy proceedings against Sam Bankman-Fried by July 2024 is relatively low. The existing legal actions and ongoing FTX bankruptcy proceedings are likely to be the primary focus for both Bankman-Fried and his creditors in the near term.

However, initiating new bankruptcy proceedings against him personally seems less likely for several reasons: 1. He's already facing criminal charges, which may take precedence over civil proceedings. 2. His assets are likely already frozen or seized, making new bankruptcy proceedings less necessary. 3. The timeline is relatively short (about a year from the question's creation date). However, it's not impossible. If new evidence of hidden assets or fraudulent activities emerges, it could potentially lead to new bankruptcy proceedings. (b) Central Bank of Argentina's Leliq rate remains at or above 75.00% in August 2024: As of June 2023, Argentina's Leliq rate is around 97%, which is extremely high. Several factors suggest it might remain high: 1. Argentina has a history of high inflation and economic instability. 2. The country is facing ongoing economic challenges, including a severe drought affecting agricultural exports. 3. There's a presidential election in late 2023, which could lead to policy changes, but effects might not be immediate. However, there are also factors that could lead to a rate decrease: 1. International pressure and potential IMF interventions. 2. A new government might implement drastic measures to stabilize the economy. 3.

North Carolina enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth: North Carolina currently has restrictions on medical care for transgender youth, as part of a broader law passed in 2023. Given the ongoing national debate on transgender rights and medical care, there's a possibility of changes to this law. However, North Carolina has a Republican-controlled legislature, which typically favors such restrictions. The likelihood of a significant change in this policy within a year seems low, but not impossible. I'd estimate this part at about 20% probability. 2. Maryland holding a referendum on abortion rights: Maryland is a predominantly Democratic state that has already taken steps to protect abortion rights. In 2022, voters approved a constitutional amendment to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution.

However, with the ongoing national debate on abortion rights, it's not entirely impossible. I'd estimate this part at about 10% probability.

Urgency of education issues: With ongoing debates about education policy, school funding, and teachers' rights, the AFT may feel compelled to make an early endorsement to ensure their voice is heard in the campaign. 6. Potential challenges: The only significant factor that might delay an endorsement would be if there were an unexpected shake-up in the Democratic primary process or if the AFT decided to wait for some reason. However, this seems unlikely given their past behavior. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that the AFT will endorse a candidate by July 2024. The organization has a clear interest in influencing the election, a history of making endorsements, and ample time to do so before the resolution date.

Existing laws: Washington already has laws protecting abortion rights. In 2022, the state even expanded access to abortion care.

Time frame: The period between now and August 2024 is relatively short for organizing a state-wide referendum, especially if it's not already in the planning stages. 4. Legislative process: Typically, referendums in Washington are initiated either by the state legislature or through a citizen initiative. There's no indication that either process has begun for an abortion rights referendum. 5. National context: While there's been increased focus on abortion rights nationally since the overturning of Roe v.

Let's analyze each part separately: (a) American Federation of Teachers (AFT) endorsement: The AFT is one of the largest teachers' unions in the United States and has a history of endorsing presidential candidates. In previous election cycles, they have typically made their endorsements well before July of the election year. For example: - In 2020, AFT endorsed Joe Biden in March 2020. - In 2016, AFT endorsed Hillary Clinton in July 2015, very early in the cycle. Given this pattern, it's highly likely that the AFT will make an endorsement by July 2024. The union tends to support Democratic candidates, and assuming the incumbent President Joe Biden runs for re-election, they are likely to endorse him early to show strong support. Even if Biden doesn't run, they would likely endorse the Democratic nominee relatively early in the process. (b) Washington referendum on abortion rights: This part is less certain. While abortion rights have been a hot-button issue since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Washington already has strong protections for abortion rights. The state codified the right to abortion in 1991, and in 2022, it further expanded and protected abortion access. Given the existing protections, there might not be an urgent need for a referendum specifically on this issue. However, the political climate around abortion rights remains volatile, and there's a possibility that pro-choice advocates might push for a referendum to further strengthen these rights or to send a message at the national level. Considering both parts: The AFT endorsement is highly likely to occur before July 2024, which alone would resolve this question as YES. The Washington referendum is less certain but still possible, providing a second, albeit less likely, path to a YES resolution. Given the high probability of the AFT endorsement occurring, and the additional possibility of the Washington referendum, the overall likelihood of this question resolving as YES is very high."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The central bank might consider lowering rates to stimulate economic growth if needed. 2. Inflation trends: If inflation shows signs of cooling down, it could give the central bank room to cut rates. However, if inflation remains persistent, they may need to keep rates higher. 3. Global economic environment: The actions of major central banks like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank can influence Israel's monetary policy.

However, a complete shutdown of 50% or more of these operations by July 2024 seems challenging. Factors to consider: The Philippine economy benefits from these operations, which might make a large-scale shutdown less likely.

Global economic trends: The global economic outlook, particularly in the United States (Mexico's largest trading partner), will influence Mexico's monetary policy. If global growth slows or if the US Federal Reserve starts cutting rates, it could give Mexico more room to ease its monetary policy. 3. Inflation trajectory: The central bank's primary mandate is to maintain price stability. If inflation shows a consistent downward trend towards the target range, it would increase the likelihood of a rate cut. 4. Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut by July 2024, which is about a year away from the current date. This provides a reasonable time frame for economic conditions to potentially change and for the central bank to adjust its policy stance. 5. Historical precedent: Central banks typically move cautiously, especially when transitioning from a tightening to an easing cycle. They often prefer to pause and assess the impact of previous rate hikes before cutting rates. 6. External factors: Geopolitical events, commodity prices, and exchange rate movements can influence the central bank's decisions. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut by July 2024. The time frame is long enough for economic conditions to potentially improve and inflation to ease, which could create room for monetary policy easing. However, there are also significant uncertainties, including the global economic outlook and the persistence of inflationary pressures."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "cf9f02ad-7546-4690-ad1e-15606e51fe73", "title": "Will either of the following occur by July 2024: (a) Microsoft lay off at least 1,800 employees as part of its AI-focused reorganization plan, or (b) The Central Bank of Mexico announce an interest rate cut?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if either of the following occurs by July 31, 2024: (a) Microsoft confirms the layoff of at least 1,800 employees as part of its AI-focused reorganization plan.

(a) Microsoft layoffs: Microsoft has been undergoing significant restructuring to focus more on AI, as evidenced by their recent investments and strategic shifts. In January 2023, they announced 10,000 layoffs, and in July 2023, they cut an additional 1,000 jobs. Given this trend and the company's continued push towards AI, it's plausible that they might announce further layoffs as part of their reorganization. However, the specific requirement of 1,800 employees being laid off as part of an AI-focused reorganization plan makes this less certain. The timeframe (by July 2024) provides ample opportunity for such an announcement, but it's not guaranteed. (b) Central Bank of Mexico interest rate cut: As of June 2023, Mexico's central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at a record high of 11.25% to combat inflation. However, there are indications that the bank might consider rate cuts in the future as inflation shows signs of easing. The resolution date of July 2024 gives more than a year for economic conditions to change, potentially allowing for a rate cut. Central banks typically move cautiously, but given the high current rate and the potential for improved economic conditions, a rate cut within this timeframe is quite possible. Combining these factors: The Microsoft layoff scenario is possible but somewhat uncertain due to the specific requirements. The interest rate cut by the Central Bank of Mexico seems more likely given the current high rates and the extended timeframe.

Turkey's history of media censorship: Turkey has a track record of implementing strict media control measures, which has led to protests in the past. The government, under President Erdogan, has been known to tighten its grip on media freedom. 2. Current political climate: Turkey is experiencing ongoing political tensions, with opposition to Erdogan's policies growing. This creates a fertile ground for protests. 3. Recent trends in civil unrest: Turkey has seen several protests in recent years, including the 2013 Gezi Park protests, which were sparked by a relatively small issue but grew into larger anti-government demonstrations. 4. Time frame: The question gives a full year for protests to occur, which is a considerable amount of time for changes to be implemented and for opposition to organize. 5. Threshold for \"large\" protests: The requirement of 1,000 participants is relatively low for a country of Turkey's size and population, making it easier to meet this criterion. 6. International attention: The requirement for reporting by major international news outlets suggests that the protests would need to be significant enough to attract global attention, which is likely given Turkey's geopolitical importance. 7. Specific trigger: The question specifies that the protests must be in response to changes in media censorship laws. This narrows the scope but also provides a clear potential catalyst for demonstrations. 8. Current global trends: Worldwide, there's an increasing awareness and concern about media freedom and censorship, which could fuel protests if new restrictive laws are introduced. Given these factors, I believe there is a relatively high likelihood of such protests occurring. The Turkish government has a history of implementing restrictive media laws, and the population has shown a willingness to protest against government policies. The specific nature of the trigger (changes in media censorship laws) and the relatively low threshold for what constitutes a \"large\" protest increase the probability. However, we must also consider potential mitigating factors: 1. Government suppression: The Turkish government might take preemptive measures to prevent large-scale protests. 2. Lack of significant changes: If no major changes to media censorship laws are implemented, the likelihood of protests decreases. 3.

Prior to the pandemic, claims above 250,000 were relatively rare. 3. Economic outlook: The U.S. economy has been showing signs of resilience, with moderate growth and a strong labor market.

The Biden administration has been encouraging states to remove such requirements. However, Wisconsin has a Republican-controlled legislature that may resist changes.

U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 250,000 for five consecutive weeks by August 2024: As of mid-2023, U.S. weekly jobless claims have been generally below 250,000. However, economic conditions can change rapidly. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could lead to increased unemployment. Additionally, there are concerns about a potential recession. Given the longer timeframe (over a year) and the economic uncertainties, this scenario seems more likely than the first.

Let's analyze each separately: a) European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate cut announcement by August 2024: The ECB has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation. As of June 2023, inflation in the Eurozone is still above the ECB's 2% target. However, economic growth in the Eurozone has been sluggish, which could prompt a rate cut if inflation continues to decline. The time frame (by August 2024) is relatively long, allowing for potential economic changes. Historical patterns suggest that central banks often adjust policies within 12-18 months. Given these factors, there's a moderate chance of an ECB rate cut announcement by August 2024, perhaps around 40-50%. b) Apple finalizing a union contract with store employees in Arizona by July 2024: Apple has historically been resistant to unionization efforts. The unionization of the Arizona store is a recent development (as of 2023). First contracts often take a long time to negotiate, sometimes years. Apple may want to avoid setting a precedent that could encourage unionization at other stores. However, there's increasing pressure on large tech companies to improve worker conditions. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for complex labor negotiations.

For Draghi to become President by July 2024, Mattarella would need to resign, and Draghi would need to be elected by the Italian Parliament.

This shows that Hyundai is willing to initiate large recalls when safety issues are identified. 2. Seatbelt importance: Seatbelts are critical safety components, and issues with them are taken very seriously by both manufacturers and regulatory bodies. If a widespread seatbelt issue is identified, it's likely to result in a recall. 3. NHTSA involvement: The question mentions an NHTSA report about seatbelts that may not properly secure passengers. This suggests that the issue is already on the radar of regulatory authorities, increasing the likelihood of a recall. 4. Time frame: The question allows for over a year (from June 2023 to August 2024) for the recall to be initiated. This is a significant amount of time for investigations to be conducted and for Hyundai to make a decision. 5. Number of vehicles: The threshold of 720,000 vehicles is substantial but not unprecedented for large automakers like Hyundai. In 2022, Hyundai and Kia recalled nearly 485,000 vehicles due to fire risks. 6. Hyundai's market presence: Hyundai is a major global automaker with millions of vehicles on the road. If a seatbelt issue affects multiple models or model years, it could easily surpass the 720,000 vehicle threshold. 7. Safety reputation: Automakers are generally quick to recall vehicles for safety issues to protect their reputation and avoid potential lawsuits. Given these factors, there seems to be a significant chance that Hyundai will initiate such a recall. The NHTSA report and the critical nature of seatbelt safety are particularly compelling reasons.

This shows that the plan is subject to political shifts. 2. Current administration: The Biden administration has shown a strong commitment to climate action and environmental protection. They have already taken steps to reverse many Trump-era environmental rollbacks. 3. Legal challenges: The original Clean Power Plan faced significant legal challenges, which could resurface if attempts are made to reinstate it. This could delay or prevent reinstatement. 4. Time frame: The question's resolution date is August 31, 2024, which is relatively soon. Regulatory processes, especially for complex rules like the Clean Power Plan, can take considerable time. 5. Political landscape: The 2024 presidential election could impact the outcome. If a new administration takes office in January 2024, it could affect the EPA's priorities. 6. Alternative approaches: The Biden administration might choose to pursue climate goals through new legislation or different regulatory approaches rather than reinstating the exact Clean Power Plan. 7. Congressional action: The current divided Congress makes it unlikely that legislative action will force or prevent reinstatement. 8. Supreme Court ruling: In 2022, the Supreme Court limited the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in West Virginia v. EPA, which could complicate efforts to reinstate the Clean Power Plan in its original form. Given these factors, while the Biden administration is likely to pursue strong climate action, the reinstatement of the specific Clean Power Plan faces significant hurdles. The Supreme Court ruling, in particular, makes it less likely that the plan will be reinstated in its original form. The EPA might instead pursue alternative regulatory approaches to achieve similar goals. The time frame is also quite tight, considering the complexity of the regulatory process and potential legal challenges.

Reinstatement of EPA's Clean Power Plan by August 31, 2024: The Clean Power Plan was a key Obama-era policy aimed at reducing carbon emissions from power plants. It was repealed during the Trump administration. The likelihood of its reinstatement depends on several factors: a) Current administration's stance: The Biden administration has shown a strong commitment to climate action, which could favor reinstatement. b) Legal challenges: The original plan faced legal challenges, and any reinstatement would likely face similar obstacles. c) Time frame: The deadline is about 14 months from the question's creation date, which is a relatively short period for such a significant policy change. d) Political landscape: The outcome of the 2024 presidential election could influence this, but the deadline is before the new administration would take office.

U.S. government's stance on EVs: The Biden administration has shown strong support for electric vehicles and has proposed significant investments in EV infrastructure and manufacturing. 3. Stellantis' position in the market: Stellantis is a major automotive company formed by the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the PSA Group. It has a significant presence in the U.S. market. 4. Stellantis' EV plans: The company has announced ambitious plans to electrify its vehicle lineup, which may make it eligible for government support. 5. Timeframe: The question allows for about a year from the creation date to the resolution date, which is a reasonable period for such grants to be approved and announced. 6. Grant amount: $500 million is a substantial sum, but not unprecedented for major automotive initiatives, especially in the EV sector. 7. Recent precedents: Other major automakers have received significant government support for EV initiatives. For example, in 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $2.5 billion loan to a joint venture of General Motors and LG Energy Solution for battery cell manufacturing. 8. Political climate: The push for EVs aligns with current U.S. political priorities, including job creation in the manufacturing sector and reducing carbon emissions. However, there are also factors that could reduce the likelihood: 1. Competition: Other automakers are also vying for government support, which could spread available funds across multiple companies. 2. Budget constraints: Federal budget considerations could limit the amount of grants available. 3. Policy changes: Potential shifts in political leadership or priorities could affect the availability of such grants. 4. Stellantis' specific proposals: The company would need to present compelling projects that align with government objectives to secure such a large grant. Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate to good chance of Stellantis receiving over $500 million in grants for EV initiatives by July 2024. The strong government support for EVs, Stellantis' significant market presence, and the precedent of large grants in this sector all contribute to this assessment.

Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Brazil will avoid a recession by July 2024.

Let's examine each part separately: 1. Brazilian economy avoiding recession by July 2024: The Brazilian economy has been showing signs of resilience in recent years, despite global economic challenges. The country has implemented various economic reforms and has a diverse economy, which can help buffer against external shocks. However, global economic uncertainties, including potential slowdowns in major economies and fluctuations in commodity prices, could impact Brazil's growth. The timeframe (until July 2024) is relatively short, which makes it more likely for the economy to avoid a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth). I would estimate the probability of Brazil avoiding a recession by July 2024 at around 70%. 2. Hang Seng Index reaching or exceeding 30,000 points by August 2024: The Hang Seng Index (HSI) has been volatile in recent years, affected by factors such as US-China tensions, regulatory crackdowns in China, and global economic uncertainties. As of my last update, the HSI was trading well below 30,000 points. Reaching 30,000 points would require a significant rally. While not impossible, it would need substantial positive catalysts such as improved US-China relations, strong economic growth in China, or increased global investor confidence in Hong Kong's market. Given the current economic climate and the challenges facing the Chinese and Hong Kong economies, I would estimate the probability of the HSI reaching 30,000 points by August 2024 at around 30%. To calculate the overall probability of at least one of these events occurring, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) Assuming these events are independent (which is a reasonable assumption given their different nature): P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.70 * 0.30 = 0.21 Therefore: P(A or B) = 0.70 + 0.30 - 0.21 = 0.79"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given these factors, while Hormel Foods likely has strong preventive measures in place, the possibility of a listeria outbreak cannot be completely ruled out over a 14-month period. The food industry, particularly in ready-to-eat products like deli meats, always carries some risk of listeria contamination. However, considering Hormel's size, resources, and likely robust food safety protocols, the probability of such an outbreak occurring and necessitating a recall is still relatively low.

However, there are concerns about a potential economic slowdown or recession in the coming year. The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes to combat inflation could lead to increased unemployment.

The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which has pushed mortgage rates higher. However, if inflation shows signs of cooling or if there's an economic downturn, the Fed might pause or even reverse its rate hikes. This could lead to lower mortgage rates.

This suggests that either the outbreak hasn't reached a level of global concern yet, or it's being managed effectively. 2. Time frame: The question gives a two-month window (July and August 2024) for the WHO to declare the outbreak no longer a global emergency. This is a relatively short period for a disease outbreak to emerge, become a global emergency, and then be declared no longer an emergency. 3. WHO's decision-making process: The WHO typically takes a cautious approach when declaring the end of health emergencies. They usually wait until there's clear evidence that the outbreak is under control and the risk of resurgence is low. 4. Seasonality of Rift Valley fever: The disease is often associated with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding. The resolution date (August) falls within the typical dry season for much of East Africa, which could potentially favor control efforts. 5. Historical precedent: Rift Valley fever outbreaks have occurred in East Africa before, but they haven't typically been declared global emergencies by the WHO. This suggests that even if an outbreak occurs, it may not reach the level of a global emergency. 6.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the WHO will declare the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa no longer a global emergency by August 2024.

As of June 2024, the global economic landscape is still recovering from recent challenges, and central banks worldwide have been cautious about their monetary policies. The Bank of England has been maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy to combat inflation. However, if economic conditions were to deteriorate rapidly or if inflation were to fall significantly below the target, the Bank might consider a rate cut. Given the volatility of economic conditions and the potential for unexpected events, there's a moderate chance of a rate cut occurring within a month.

Precedent: Similar laws in other states have faced legal challenges, but many remain in effect. For example, Texas's 6-week ban (SB 8) has survived legal challenges thus far. 6. Public opinion: While national polls show majority support for abortion rights, Idaho's conservative populace may be more supportive of the ban, reducing pressure on lawmakers to repeal it. 7. Federal action: It's unlikely that federal legislation will be passed to protect abortion rights given the current composition of Congress. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Idaho's 6-week abortion ban will be overturned by July 2024.

The state legislature is controlled by Republicans, but any new restrictive laws would likely be vetoed by the governor.

The law has been temporarily blocked by courts in the past, indicating that there are grounds for legal opposition. However, with the current conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court and the general trend of upholding restrictive abortion laws, a complete overturn of the law seems less likely.

However, political landscapes can change, and there might be a push for further reinforcement of these rights. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for organizing a new referendum.

(a) Sony announcing a new major sports media partnership: Sony is a major player in the entertainment industry, but they're not traditionally known for sports media rights. However, they have been expanding their presence in the sports market. In 2021, Sony acquired Hawk-Eye Innovations, a sports technology company, showing their interest in sports-related ventures. The sports media rights market is highly competitive and lucrative, with major tech companies like Amazon and Apple entering the space. Given Sony's resources and potential interest in diversifying their media portfolio, it's plausible they might pursue a major sports partnership. However, such deals are relatively rare and often take years to negotiate. The timeframe of about 13 months (from the question's creation date to resolution date) makes it somewhat unlikely, but not impossible. (b) Paramount and Skydance announcing a merger agreement: There have been ongoing rumors and speculation about potential mergers or acquisitions involving Paramount (formerly ViacomCBS) due to the challenging landscape of the streaming industry.

They often result in lower enrollment numbers compared to traditional Medicaid expansion. 3. Historical context: Other states that have implemented work requirements for Medicaid have seen reduced enrollment.

Given the importance of insulin and the existing legislative framework, it's quite possible that insulin could be included in negotiated prices earlier than the general timeline. The August 2024 deadline gives ample time for this to occur. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 70%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of either of two events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), and assuming the events are independent: P(YES) = 0.15 + 0.70 - (0.15 * 0.70) = 0.85 - 0.105 = 0.745.

This has increased the likelihood of states considering constitutional amendments or referendums on the issue. 3. Existing protections: Illinois already has strong abortion protections in place. The Reproductive Health Act ensures that abortion remains legal in the state even if Roe v. Wade is overturned. This might reduce the urgency for a referendum. 4.

Importance of safety: Safety protocols are a critical aspect of railroad operations, and both the company and the union have a vested interest in ensuring the safety of engineers. This mutual interest increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement. 3. Ongoing dispute: The question mentions an ongoing dispute, which suggests that both parties are already engaged in discussions. This existing dialogue could facilitate faster resolution. 4. Industry pressure: The railroad industry is under constant scrutiny for safety issues, and there may be external pressure from regulators, stakeholders, and the public to improve safety measures. 5. Union leverage: Labor unions in the railroad industry historically have significant bargaining power, which could push Union Pacific to address safety concerns more readily. 6.

The RBA's primary mandate is to maintain price stability, targeting an inflation rate of 2-3%. 2. Inflation outlook: For the RBA to consider cutting rates, inflation would need to show a consistent downward trend and approach the target range. This process typically takes time, and given the current high inflation environment, it might not fully materialize by August 2024. 3. Global economic trends: The global economic outlook and actions of other major central banks can influence the RBA's decisions. If there's a global economic slowdown, it might prompt the RBA to consider rate cuts. 4. Labor market conditions: Australia's labor market has been strong, with low unemployment. A significant weakening in the job market could prompt the RBA to cut rates to stimulate the economy. 5. Housing market: Australia's housing market is sensitive to interest rate changes. If there's a severe downturn in the housing market, it might prompt the RBA to cut rates. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut announcement by August 2024, which is about 14 months from the current date (assuming current date is June 2023).

ALJs are generally subject to the ethical standards of the agencies they work for and broader federal employee ethics rules. 2. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is about 13 months from the creation date of this question. This is a relatively short period for developing, approving, and implementing a new ethics code, especially considering the complexities of the U.S. federal government. 3. Political climate: The current political environment in the U.S. is highly polarized, which can make it challenging to pass new regulations or codes, especially those affecting the judicial system. 4. Existing momentum: There have been discussions and proposals in recent years about the need for a more standardized ethics code for ALJs, but no concrete actions have been taken yet. 5. Complexity of implementation: Creating an ethics code that is applicable to all ALJs across various federal agencies would require significant coordination and potentially face resistance from different departments. 6. Enforcement mechanisms: Developing clear enforcement mechanisms that are legally binding would add another layer of complexity to the process. 7. Precedent: While there are ethics codes for federal judges, creating a specific code for ALJs would be a new undertaking, which might face bureaucratic hurdles. 8. Public attention: Unless there is a high-profile case or scandal involving ALJs that draws significant public attention, this issue may not be a top priority for lawmakers or the administration. Given these factors, while it's possible that an ethics code could be established by July 2024, it seems unlikely.

Recent legislative history: In 2022, North Carolina enacted a law banning most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. This indicates a willingness to restrict abortion rights, but falls short of a total ban. 3. National trends: Following the overturning of Roe v.

Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of July 2024, which is about a year away. This provides ample time for legislation to be introduced and debated. 5. Public opinion: North Carolina is a swing state, and public opinion on abortion is divided.

(a) Enforceable ethics code for U.S. administrative law judges: The establishment of an enforceable ethics code for U.S. administrative law judges is a complex process that would likely require significant time and political will. As of now, there doesn't seem to be any major push or public discussion about implementing such a code. The timeframe given (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a substantial change in the legal system. Without any current indications of movement in this direction, the probability of this occurring within the given timeframe appears low. (b) North Carolina Senate passing a total abortion ban: North Carolina has been trending towards stricter abortion laws. In 2022, the state enacted a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. However, a total abortion ban as described in the question would be a significant further step. The North Carolina legislature is currently controlled by Republicans, who generally favor stricter abortion laws. However, the state's Democratic governor has the power to veto such legislation, and overriding a veto requires a supermajority that the Republicans don't currently possess. Additionally, there would likely be significant public opposition to such a ban. While it's not impossible, passing a total abortion ban by July 2024 faces substantial hurdles. Combining these factors: The probability of (a) occurring seems quite low, perhaps around 10%. The probability of (b) occurring is higher but still faces significant obstacles, perhaps around 30%.

Given the current global economic climate and Japan's persistent struggle with inflation, it seems unlikely that the BOJ would cut rates further.

Current economic conditions: Vietnam's economy has been growing steadily, but like many countries, it faces challenges from global economic uncertainties and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2. Inflation: The State Bank of Vietnam closely monitors inflation rates. If inflation remains under control or decreases, it might provide room for an interest rate cut. 3. Global economic trends: The actions of major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, can influence Vietnam's monetary policy decisions. 4. Previous policy actions: The State Bank of Vietnam has shown willingness to adjust interest rates in response to economic conditions in the past. 5. Time frame: The question allows for a relatively long period (until August 2024) for the announcement to be made, which increases the likelihood of a rate cut occurring. 6. Economic growth targets: If Vietnam's economic growth slows or falls below targets, the central bank may use interest rate cuts as a tool to stimulate the economy. 7. Export competitiveness: Vietnam's economy is export-oriented, and a lower interest rate could help maintain export competitiveness by potentially weakening the currency. Given these factors, there are reasons to believe that an interest rate cut is possible within the given timeframe: - The extended period until August 2024 provides ample opportunity for economic conditions to evolve in a way that would warrant a rate cut. - Vietnam's central bank has historically been responsive to economic needs and global trends. - If global economic conditions deteriorate or major economies implement looser monetary policies, Vietnam may follow suit to maintain competitiveness. However, there are also factors that could prevent a rate cut: - If inflation rises unexpectedly, the central bank may need to maintain or even increase rates. - Strong economic growth might reduce the need for monetary stimulus. - Geopolitical tensions or external shocks could influence policy decisions in unpredictable ways. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high likelihood of the Central Bank of Vietnam announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024.

U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 250,000 for four consecutive weeks by August 2024: The U.S. job market has been relatively strong in recent years, with jobless claims generally staying below 250,000. However, there are concerns about a potential economic slowdown or recession. As of mid-2023, jobless claims have occasionally spiked above 250,000 but haven't consistently remained there. Given the timeframe (until August 2024), there's a moderate chance of this occurring if economic conditions worsen. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 30%. 2. Central Bank of Vietnam announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: Vietnam's economy has been growing steadily, but like many countries, it faces challenges from global economic uncertainties. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has been known to adjust interest rates in response to economic conditions. As of mid-2023, Vietnam's interest rates are relatively high compared to some other countries, which gives the SBV room to cut rates if needed to stimulate growth. Given the long timeframe and the possibility of global economic changes, I'd estimate the probability of an interest rate cut announcement by August 2024 at around 60%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves YES if either event occurs. To calculate the probability of at least one of these independent events occurring, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - (P(A) * P(B)) = 0.30 + 0.60 - (0.30 * 0.60) = 0.90 - 0.18 = 0.72.

Historically, conservative states have been more likely to maintain or increase restrictions on transgender healthcare rather than loosen them. 2. Existing legislation: Indiana already has restrictions in place for transgender youth healthcare. In April 2023, Indiana enacted a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, which took effect on July 1, 2023. This recent legislation suggests that the state is not inclined to modify these restrictions in the near future. 3.

However, Indiana has not shown signs of reversing course on this issue. 4. Timeframe: The question asks about a change by July 2024, which is only about a year away. Given the slow pace of legislative changes and the recent implementation of restrictions, it seems unlikely that Indiana would reverse course so quickly. 5. Public opinion and advocacy: While there are advocacy groups working to protect transgender rights, Indiana's conservative majority makes it less likely for public opinion to sway legislative action in favor of modifying restrictions. 6. Legal challenges: It's possible that legal challenges to the existing law could prompt legislative action, but such challenges often take longer than a year to result in legislative changes. 7.

In fact, the country has been phasing out nuclear power, with plans to close all existing nuclear plants by 2035. Given the global trend towards renewable energy and Spain's commitment to this transition, it seems unlikely that they would suddenly announce plans for new nuclear reactors. However, energy security concerns and the need for stable baseload power could potentially influence such a decision. The probability of this occurring by July 2024 is very low, perhaps around 5%. b) French President's Office announcing conversion of additional vehicles to biofuel: France has been actively promoting the use of biofuels as part of its environmental strategy. The French government, including the President's office, has shown interest in demonstrating leadership in environmental initiatives. Converting official vehicles to biofuel is a relatively easy and visible way to showcase this commitment. There's a higher likelihood of this happening compared to Spain's nuclear announcement. I would estimate the probability of this occurring by July 2024 at around 30%. To calculate the overall probability, we need to consider the likelihood of either event occurring.

As of June 2023, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has maintained a relatively high interest rate of 6.25% to combat inflation. However, there are several factors that could lead to a rate cut by August 2024: 1. Global economic trends: If global inflation eases and major central banks like the Federal Reserve start cutting rates, the BSP might follow suit. 2. Domestic economic conditions: If inflation in the Philippines significantly decreases or economic growth slows, the BSP might consider a rate cut to stimulate the economy. 3. Time frame: The period until August 2024 is relatively long, allowing for potential changes in economic conditions.

Political climate: Oregon is a predominantly Democratic state, with Democrats controlling both chambers of the state legislature and the governorship. This political alignment generally supports maintaining or expanding abortion rights. 3. Recent legislative actions: In 2022, Oregon passed a law to protect abortion providers and patients from out-of-state legal action. This suggests that the state government is proactive in protecting abortion rights through legislative means. 4.

Industry trends: The media and entertainment industry has been experiencing consolidation due to increasing competition from streaming services. This trend could make a merger between ViacomCBS and Discovery Inc. more likely. 2. Recent history: In 2021, Discovery Inc. merged with WarnerMedia to form Warner Bros. Discovery. This recent major merger makes it less likely for Discovery to engage in another significant merger so soon. 3. Regulatory environment: Antitrust concerns might arise from a potential merger between two large media companies, which could discourage such a move. 4.

Current economic conditions: Mexico's economy has been facing challenges, including high inflation rates. As of 2023, inflation has been above the central bank's target of 3%, which has led to a tightening cycle. 2. Inflation trends: If inflation shows a consistent downward trend towards the target rate, it could pave the way for rate cuts. However, this would need to happen relatively quickly for a cut to be announced by August 2024. 3. Global economic factors: The decisions of major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, influence Mexico's monetary policy. If global economic conditions improve and other central banks start easing, it could create room for Mexico to follow suit. 4. Time frame: The question gives about 14 months from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a significant period in which economic conditions could change substantially. 5. Historical context: The Bank of Mexico tends to be cautious and often lags behind other central banks in easing cycles. They typically wait for clear evidence of sustained improvement in economic indicators before cutting rates. 6. Political considerations: While the central bank is independent, broader government policies and potential pressure for economic stimulus could play a role. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The time frame is long enough for economic conditions to potentially improve, allowing for a policy shift. However, the Bank of Mexico's historically cautious approach and the current high inflation environment suggest that they may be hesitant to cut rates quickly. If inflation shows a clear downward trend in the latter half of 2023 and early 2024, and if global economic conditions improve, the likelihood of a rate cut announcement would increase significantly. However, given the uncertainties and the bank's typical caution, I don't believe the probability is extremely high."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "3a1c3b54-6884-463a-a2b9-05f75a8807e2", "title": "Will either of the following occur by August 2024: (a) ViacomCBS and Discovery Inc. announce a merger agreement, or (b) the Central Bank of Mexico announces an interest rate cut?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) By July 31, 2024, ViacomCBS and Discovery Inc. publicly announce a merger agreement.

(a) ViacomCBS and Discovery Inc. merger: ViacomCBS and Discovery Inc. are both major players in the media industry. However, it's important to note that Discovery Inc. has already merged with WarnerMedia to form Warner Bros. Discovery in April 2022. This makes a merger between ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Global) and Discovery Inc. highly unlikely, as Discovery Inc. no longer exists as an independent entity. The probability of this part occurring is extremely low, close to zero. (b) Central Bank of Mexico interest rate cut: The Central Bank of Mexico (Banxico) sets its monetary policy based on various economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic conditions. As of June 2023, Mexico's interest rate is at 11.25%, which is relatively high. This high rate is primarily to combat inflation, which has been a concern in recent years. Factors to consider: 1. Inflation trends: If inflation shows signs of cooling down by 2024, it could prompt Banxico to consider rate cuts. 2. Economic growth: If Mexico's economy slows down, it might necessitate rate cuts to stimulate growth. 3. Global economic conditions: Changes in major economies like the US can influence Mexico's monetary policy. 4. Time frame: We have until August 2024, which gives ample time for economic conditions to change. Given these factors, there's a moderate chance that Banxico might announce an interest rate cut by August 2024. However, it's not certain, as it depends on how economic conditions evolve. Combining the probabilities: Since the question resolves as YES if either event occurs, and the probability of the first event (merger) is nearly zero, the overall probability is essentially determined by the likelihood of the interest rate cut.

Historical precedent: Barclays has previously engaged in similar transactions. In 2023, Barclays Bank issued pass-through certificates worth \u20b97,016 crore (approximately $848 million) in India. This demonstrates that the bank has experience with this type of financial instrument and is willing to use it as a strategy. 2. Market conditions: The global financial market has been experiencing volatility and uncertainty due to various factors such as inflation, geopolitical tensions, and economic recovery post-pandemic. This environment might encourage banks to explore various funding options and manage their loan portfolios more actively. 3. Regulatory environment: Banks are under increasing pressure to maintain strong capital positions and manage risk effectively. Pass-through certificates can be an effective tool for banks to transfer risk and free up capital. 4. Time frame: The question allows for a period of about 14 months from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a reasonable timeframe for a large bank like Barclays to plan and execute such a financial transaction. 5. Amount: The $1 billion threshold is significant but not unreasonable for a bank of Barclays' size. The previous issuance in 2023 was close to this amount, suggesting that reaching or exceeding $1 billion is feasible. 6. Strategic considerations: As mentioned in the question, such issuances are often part of strategies to manage loan portfolios or address funding gaps. Given the dynamic nature of the banking industry, it's likely that Barclays will continue to use various financial instruments to optimize its operations. 7. Global presence: Barclays' international presence, particularly its operations in India where it has previously issued such certificates, increases the likelihood of using this financial instrument again. However, we must also consider potential challenges: 1. Alternative strategies: Barclays might opt for other financial instruments or strategies to manage its loan portfolio and funding. 2. Market appetite: The success of such an issuance depends on market demand, which can be influenced by various economic factors. 3. Regulatory changes: Any significant changes in banking regulations could affect the bank's ability or willingness to issue pass-through certificates. Given these considerations, I believe there is a good chance that Barclays will issue pass-through certificates worth at least $1 billion by August 2024.

While it's not uncommon for large banks to issue pass-through certificates as part of their financial strategies, predicting a specific issuance of this magnitude within a given timeframe is challenging. Without recent news or announcements from Barclays about such plans, we can consider this event as possible but not highly probable. 2. U.S. economy avoiding a recession by July 2024: This is the more likely condition to be met. As of mid-2023, while there are concerns about economic slowdown, the U.S. economy has shown resilience. The Federal Reserve has been implementing measures to control inflation while trying to achieve a 'soft landing.' Many economists believe that even if a recession occurs, it might be mild and short-lived. The timeframe until July 2024 is relatively short, which increases the likelihood of avoiding a recession within this period. Given these factors, the probability of this question resolving as YES is quite high.

This division makes it challenging to pass legislation for a referendum. 2. Abortion rights status: Virginia currently allows abortion up to the third trimester. While there have been attempts to restrict abortion rights, there hasn't been a strong push for a constitutional amendment to protect these rights. 3. Legislative process: In Virginia, to amend the state constitution, a proposed amendment must pass both houses of the General Assembly in two separate years with an election in between, and then be approved by voters in a referendum. This process takes time and would be difficult to complete by August 2024. 4. Timeline: As of the question creation date (June 30, 2024), there's very little time left for the necessary legislative steps to occur before August 2024.

Given this context, it's unlikely that Arkansas would need to pass another total abortion ban, as they already have one in place. The probability of this occurring is quite low. b) Virginia holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: Virginia is a politically competitive state where abortion rights have been a contentious issue. In recent years, there have been efforts by both pro-choice and pro-life groups to influence abortion laws in the state. However, holding a statewide referendum on a constitutional issue is a complex process that typically requires approval from the state legislature. As of 2023, Virginia's government is divided, with Republicans controlling the House of Delegates and Democrats controlling the Senate and the governorship. This division makes it less likely for a referendum to be approved, as it would require bipartisan support. Moreover, the timeframe for this to occur (by August 2024) is relatively short, considering the legislative processes involved in approving a referendum. While it's not impossible, it's also not highly probable given the current political landscape and the time constraints.

This question specifically asks about import projects, which are not currently under a pause. 2. Energy landscape: The U.S. has been a net exporter of natural gas since 2017, primarily due to increased domestic production from shale gas. This reduces the need for LNG imports. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is only about a month after the question was created. This short timeframe makes significant policy changes less likely. 4. Political context: Energy policies can be influenced by political factors, including administration changes or shifts in congressional control. However, no major political events (like elections) are scheduled between the creation and resolution dates. 5. Global energy market: While global energy markets can be volatile, there's no current indication of a drastic shift that would necessitate a sudden increase in U.S. LNG imports. 6. Existing infrastructure: The U.S. already has LNG import terminals, some of which have been converted to export terminals. Resuming consideration of import projects would likely involve repurposing or expanding existing facilities rather than building new ones. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the U.S. government would need to resume consideration of LNG import projects by July 2024. The country's status as a net exporter of natural gas, combined with the short timeframe and lack of apparent drivers for such a policy shift, suggests a low probability of this occurring. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility. Unforeseen global events, such as a major disruption in domestic gas production or a sudden increase in global LNG prices, could potentially prompt a reconsideration of import policies.

Recent developments: In March 2023, Germany and Japan held their first-ever government consultations, signaling a desire to deepen their bilateral relationship. This suggests an ongoing interest in expanding cooperation. 3. Time frame: The question's resolution date is July 31, 2024, which gives the two countries just over a year from the current date to implement a new form of cooperation. 4. Areas of potential cooperation: Both countries are leaders in technology, manufacturing, and renewable energy. There's potential for new collaborations in these areas. 5.

Historical precedent: While Germany and Japan have existing partnerships, they have shown willingness to create new forms of cooperation in the past. 7.

The existing strong relationship, recent high-level consultations, and shared interests provide a solid foundation for new initiatives. The time frame of just over a year is somewhat tight but not unreasonable for developing and announcing a new cooperation framework. However, the requirement for the cooperation to be 'distinctly different' from existing partnerships and the need for official announcements and international news coverage add some uncertainty.

Rand Paul retracting his statement about Biden's healthcare stance: Rand Paul is known for his strong conservative views and is often critical of Biden's policies. Politicians rarely retract their statements unless there's overwhelming evidence against them or significant public pressure. Without knowing the specific statement in question or any current controversy surrounding it, it's unlikely that Paul would retract or significantly alter his statement. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for such a change to occur. Probability for this part: Low, around 0.1. 2. Minnesota enacting a new law modifying transgender youth medical care restrictions: Minnesota has been known for its progressive stance on LGBTQ+ rights. However, the question implies that there are current restrictions on medical care for transgender youth in Minnesota. Given the growing awareness and advocacy for transgender rights, there's a possibility that Minnesota might revisit and modify these restrictions. The timeframe (by July 2024) gives more than a year for such legislation to be proposed, debated, and enacted. However, passing new laws can be a complex and time-consuming process, especially on controversial topics. Probability for this part: Moderate, around 0.4. To calculate the overall probability, we need to consider the likelihood of either event occurring. Using the formula for the probability of either of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.1 + 0.4 - (0.1 * 0.4) = 0.46.

This shows that the FDA does take action when lead contamination is detected in spices. 2. Time frame: The question gives a relatively short time frame of about one month from the creation date to the resolution date. This narrow window reduces the likelihood of a recall being issued specifically within this period. 3.

A study published in the Journal of Food Protection in 2017 found that some paprika samples contained lead, though not at levels requiring immediate action. 4. FDA monitoring and testing: The FDA regularly monitors and tests food products, including spices, for contaminants. However, given the vast number of food products on the market, it's unlikely that they would specifically target ground paprika for testing within this short timeframe unless there was a specific reason to do so. 5. Reporting and investigation process: Even if lead contamination were detected, the process of investigating, confirming, and issuing a recall takes time. The short timeframe makes it less likely for this entire process to be completed within the given period. 6.

However, widespread recalls for this specific issue are not common. The FDA regularly monitors and tests food products, but a recall would only be issued if a significant health risk is identified. Without any current indications of a widespread lead contamination issue in ground paprika, the probability of this occurring seems relatively low. Let's estimate this at about 10%. 2.

As of now (June 2023), it remains a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). However, cases have significantly declined globally since the peak of the outbreak. The WHO regularly reviews the status of such emergencies, and given the improving situation, there's a reasonable chance they might declare it no longer a global emergency by August 2024.

Bed Bath & Beyond: Bed Bath & Beyond filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2023. The company has already begun liquidation sales and is closing all of its stores. Given the severity of its financial situation and the closure of its retail operations, it seems highly unlikely that Bed Bath & Beyond will emerge from bankruptcy as a reorganized company by July 2024. 2. Frontier Communications: Frontier Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2020 and emerged from bankruptcy in April 2021. Since the company has already completed its bankruptcy process, it is not currently in bankruptcy and therefore cannot 'emerge' again by July 2024. 3. Timeframe: The question asks about the status by July 31, 2024, which is about a year from now. Bankruptcy proceedings, especially for large companies, can often take several months to years to resolve. 4. Current economic conditions: The overall economic environment remains challenging, which could potentially complicate or prolong bankruptcy proceedings for companies in general. Given these factors, the probability of either company emerging from bankruptcy by July 2024 is extremely low: - Bed Bath & Beyond is unlikely to emerge as a reorganized company given its current liquidation process. - Frontier Communications is not currently in bankruptcy, so it cannot 'emerge' again. The only scenario where this could potentially resolve as YES would be if Bed Bath & Beyond somehow manages to find a buyer for a significant portion of its assets and restructures as a much smaller company.

Upcoming elections: The 2024 elections could potentially change the composition of the state legislature, but given Utah's political leanings, a dramatic shift is unlikely. 5. Legal challenges: While the law has survived challenges so far, ongoing or new legal challenges could potentially lead to changes. 6. Public opinion: Utah's current law is more permissive than some other conservative states, which might reflect a balance between conservative values and more moderate public opinion on abortion. 7. Time frame: The question asks about a period of about 14 months from now. This is a relatively short time in terms of legislative processes, making significant changes less likely. 8. Stability of the current law: The 18-week limit has been in place for several years, suggesting it has found some level of acceptance within the state. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance that the law will remain unchanged. The conservative nature of the state reduces the likelihood of expansion, while the relative moderation of the current law (compared to other conservative states) and its stability over the past few years reduce the likelihood of further restrictions.

This is a relatively long time frame, which increases the possibility of a strike occurring and being resolved. 5. Resolution criteria: The criteria for resolution are quite specific and stringent. The strike must involve at least 1,000 workers, last for at least a week, and be resolved with official statements and international news coverage. These requirements make it less likely for a qualifying strike to occur and be resolved within the given timeframe. 6. Global labor trends: There has been an increase in labor activism globally in recent years, which could potentially affect Nissan as well. 7. Nissan's current strategy: The company is undergoing significant changes as part of its Nissan NEXT transformation plan, which could potentially lead to restructuring and labor tensions. Considering these factors, while it's possible for a major strike to occur and be resolved within the given timeframe, the probability is not particularly high. The absence of current labor unrest at Nissan and the company's historical ability to manage labor relations effectively work against the likelihood of a major strike. However, the economic pressures and ongoing changes in the company do increase the possibility of labor disputes arising. Given the specific criteria for the strike and its resolution, and the relatively long timeframe, I would estimate a moderate but not high probability of this event occurring."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "ae1d8637-b723-4d65-930f-e03c6cb60b8f", "title": "Will the Central Bank of Russia announce an interest rate cut by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if the Central Bank of Russia officially announces an interest rate cut to take effect by August 31, 2024.

Current economic situation: As of June 2024, Russia's economy is still dealing with the aftermath of international sanctions and geopolitical tensions. This has likely led to elevated inflation and economic instability. 2. Recent monetary policy trends: The Central Bank of Russia has historically been cautious and often maintained higher interest rates to combat inflation and support the ruble. Without specific recent data, it's difficult to determine if they've been in a tightening or easing cycle. 3. Inflation outlook: The bank's decision will largely depend on the inflation trajectory. If inflation is showing signs of easing, it might create room for a rate cut. 4. Economic growth: If economic growth is sluggish, there might be pressure to cut rates to stimulate the economy. However, this would be balanced against inflationary concerns. 5. Global economic conditions: The global economic environment, including actions by major central banks like the Fed and ECB, can influence Russia's monetary policy decisions. 6.

Geopolitical factors: Any changes in the geopolitical landscape could impact the decision-making process of the Central Bank. Given these factors, and without more specific recent data, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether a rate cut will be announced. The Central Bank of Russia tends to be conservative in its approach, and two months is a short time frame for a policy shift unless economic conditions change rapidly. However, if we assume that the global and Russian economies are gradually stabilizing from previous shocks, there might be some room for a modest rate cut to support economic growth. But this would only happen if inflation is under control and the ruble is stable. Considering all these factors, I would estimate a moderate probability of a rate cut announcement, but leaning towards the lower side due to the typically cautious approach of the Central Bank of Russia and the short time frame."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "7a7dbf08-c4a3-48cb-8156-9d19e39d9193", "title": "Will either Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. resolve a major workers' strike by July 2024, or will the Central Bank of Russia announce an interest rate cut by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. reaches an agreement with unionized workers, resulting in the end of a significant strike by July 31, 2024.

Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. resolving a major workers' strike by July 2024: Currently, there is no ongoing major strike at Nissan that fits the criteria described. While labor disputes can arise unexpectedly, the likelihood of a significant strike meeting all the specified conditions (1000+ participants, lasting at least a week, and being resolved within a month) seems relatively low. Nissan has a history of generally good labor relations, especially in its home country of Japan. However, labor tensions can occur in its international operations. Given the short timeframe (about a month from the question's creation date to the resolution deadline), the probability of this specific scenario occurring is low. 2. Central Bank of Russia announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: This scenario seems more probable. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) actively manages its interest rates in response to economic conditions. As of June 2023, the CBR's key rate is 7.5%. Given the global economic uncertainties and Russia's specific economic challenges due to international sanctions, there's a reasonable chance the CBR might need to stimulate the economy by cutting rates. The timeframe for this scenario (about two months) provides more room for economic conditions to change, potentially warranting a rate cut. However, it's important to note that rate decisions depend on various factors including inflation, economic growth, and geopolitical situations, which can be unpredictable. Combining these scenarios, we have a low probability event (Nissan strike resolution) and a moderate probability event (Russian interest rate cut). Since only one of these needs to occur for a YES resolution, we should consider the probability of at least one happening. Given the longer timeframe and the more frequent nature of central bank decisions compared to major labor disputes, the Russian interest rate cut scenario dominates this probability calculation.

Global economic factors: Global economic conditions, including potential recessions in other countries, could influence the BoC's decision. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut by August 2024, which is about 14 months from now (as of June 2023). This is a relatively short time frame for a complete reversal in monetary policy. 7. BoC's communication: The BoC has maintained a hawkish stance, indicating that they are more concerned about inflation being too high rather than too low. 8. Economic shocks: Unforeseen economic shocks (e.g., a severe recession) could prompt faster policy changes, but these are hard to predict. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the BoC will cut rates by August 2024. They would need to see a significant and sustained decrease in inflation, along with other economic indicators suggesting the need for monetary easing. While it's possible that economic conditions could change rapidly, the current trajectory and the BoC's cautious approach make a rate cut in this timeframe improbable. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility. Economic conditions can change quickly, and if inflation falls faster than expected or if a recession occurs, the BoC might be compelled to cut rates sooner."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "363fca9a-6722-43b3-90b5-10d6271ef253", "title": "Will either the average rate on a 15-year mortgage exceed 5.5% by August 2024 or the Bank of Canada announce a reduction in its key interest rate by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) At any point during August 2024, the average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, as reported by Freddie Mac in its Primary Mortgage Market Survey, exceeds 5.5%.

While there's a possibility of rates decreasing due to potential economic slowdowns or policy changes, it's also possible that they could remain elevated or even increase further due to persistent inflation or other economic factors.

The BoC has been in a tightening cycle to combat inflation. While it's possible that by August 2024 the economic conditions could change, necessitating a rate cut, it's not certain. The BoC would need to see sustained evidence of cooling inflation and potentially some economic weakness to consider rate cuts. Given the timeframe of over a year, there's a reasonable chance this could occur, but it's far from guaranteed.

This is a relatively short time for complex legal cases to be fully resolved, especially if they involve multiple appeals. 3. Political climate: Arizona has been a traditionally conservative state, but it has been shifting towards becoming more politically competitive in recent years. This could influence the judicial approach to the abortion ban. 4. Legal precedent: The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 has allowed states to implement stricter abortion laws. However, state constitutions may provide additional protections that could conflict with a near-total ban. 5. Public opinion: There has been significant public debate and opposition to strict abortion bans in many states, which could influence legal interpretations. 6. Judicial composition: The ideological makeup of the Arizona state courts, particularly the Arizona Supreme Court, will play a crucial role in determining the constitutionality of the ban. 7. Potential for appeals: Even if a lower court rules on the constitutionality of the ban, there is a high likelihood of appeals, which could extend beyond the August 2024 deadline. 8.

Given these factors, I believe it is unlikely that Arizona's near-total abortion ban will be declared constitutional by August 2024. The legal process is often slow, and with the contentious nature of abortion laws, it's probable that the case will face multiple challenges and appeals. Additionally, the shifting political landscape in Arizona and the potential for state constitutional protections may work against a quick declaration of constitutionality.

Maine recently enacted a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases in June 2023 as part of a package of gun safety measures. This law is relatively new, and there hasn't been much time for significant opposition to build or for legal challenges to make their way through the courts. Given that the resolution date is August 2024, which is only about a year after the law's implementation, it seems likely that this waiting period will still be in effect. New Mexico has had child access prevention laws for firearms in place for some time, and these laws are generally less controversial than other gun control measures. The fact that this law is already established and not newly implemented makes it even more likely to remain in place through August 2024. Considering both cases, the question resolves as YES if either condition is met. This significantly increases the likelihood of a YES resolution. For the question to resolve as NO, both laws would need to be repealed or struck down by August 2024, which seems unlikely given the short timeframe, the general difficulty in repealing established laws, the bipartisan nature of child access prevention laws, and the recent implementation of Maine's waiting period. Given these factors, it seems highly probable that at least one of these laws will remain in place through August 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.009275910635681728, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0030919702118939094, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.13435230372511459, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
