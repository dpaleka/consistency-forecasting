Historical precedent: Coca-Cola has had product recalls in the past, but they are relatively rare for metal contamination specifically. In 2019, there was a small-scale recall of Coca-Cola bottles in Northern Ireland due to potential metal contamination, but this was an isolated incident. 2. Quality control measures: Coca-Cola is known for its stringent quality control processes. They have advanced detection systems and protocols in place to prevent metal contamination, which significantly reduces the likelihood of such an event occurring. 3. Supply chain complexity: Coca-Cola has a vast and complex global supply chain. While this increases the potential points of failure where contamination could occur, it also means they have extensive experience in managing and monitoring their production processes. 4. Time frame: The question specifies a period of about 14 months (from the creation date to the resolution date). This is a relatively short time frame, which reduces the probability of such a specific event occurring. 5. Regulatory environment: Food safety regulations are becoming increasingly strict worldwide, which puts pressure on companies to maintain high standards. However, this also means that if contamination does occur, it's more likely to be detected and result in a recall. 6. Public scrutiny: As a high-profile company, Coca-Cola is under constant public and media scrutiny. This could make them more likely to issue a recall if there's even a slight risk, to protect their reputation. 7. Rarity of metal contamination: Metal contamination is generally less common than other types of food contamination (like bacterial contamination), further reducing the likelihood of this specific type of recall. Considering these factors, while it's not impossible for a metal contamination recall to occur, it seems quite unlikely given Coca-Cola's track record, quality control measures, and the specific nature of the contamination specified.

Historical data on listeria outbreaks in deli meats: Listeria outbreaks in deli meats do occur occasionally. However, they are not extremely common, and when they do happen, they don't always lead to recalls, especially if caught early. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a recall by August 2024, which is about 14 months from now. This is a relatively short time frame, which somewhat reduces the likelihood of an outbreak occurring and being detected within this period. 4. Industry standards and regulations: The deli meat industry is heavily regulated, and companies like Boar's Head are subject to frequent inspections and strict safety standards. This helps prevent contamination but doesn't eliminate the risk entirely. 5. Recent trends: There haven't been any major listeria outbreaks linked to Boar's Head products in recent years, which is a positive sign for their quality control processes. 6.

However, fully relocating a major company's headquarters is a significant undertaking that requires extensive planning and resources.

Given the ongoing scrutiny of big tech companies and the evolving regulatory landscape, it's quite likely that Google will face new legal actions within the specified timeframe. The U.S. government, at both federal and state levels, has shown increased interest in regulating tech giants, and Google's wide-ranging influence makes it a frequent target.

(a) Pennsylvania conducting a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: Pennsylvania is a politically divided state, with abortion being a contentious issue. There's growing national debate around abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. However, organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that requires significant political will and resources. As of now, there's no widely reported plan or strong movement for such a referendum in Pennsylvania. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for organizing such a significant political event. Given these factors, the probability of this occurring seems low, perhaps around 20%. (b) Tennessee enacting stricter abortion regulations by July 2024: Tennessee is a conservative state that has historically been supportive of restricting abortion rights. The state already has strict abortion laws, including a near-total ban enacted after Roe v. Wade was overturned. Given the existing strict regulations, there might be less urgency or political will to enact even stricter laws. However, conservative states have continued to push for more restrictions where possible. The timeframe (by July 2024) allows for a legislative session where such laws could be proposed and passed. Considering these factors, the probability of this occurring seems moderate, perhaps around 40%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08 or 8%.

The state has already taken strong measures to protect abortion rights, and there doesn't seem to be a pressing need for another constitutional amendment on this topic. 2. Tennessee: Tennessee, on the other hand, is a more conservative state with a history of restrictive healthcare policies, particularly regarding abortion. The state has not shown significant interest in expanding healthcare access through constitutional amendments or referendums. In fact, Tennessee has been more focused on restricting abortion access rather than expanding healthcare rights. Additionally, organizing and conducting a statewide referendum is a complex and time-consuming process. It typically requires gathering signatures, legislative approval, and significant public debate.

Given these factors, it seems likely that both states could pass such legislation in their Senates by July 2024. However, there are some mitigating factors: 1. Existing laws: Since both states already have very restrictive laws, there might be less urgency to pass new legislation. 2. Public opinion: There could be pushback from constituents, even in conservative states. 3. Legal challenges: Existing laws in both states have faced legal challenges, which might make legislators hesitant to pass new laws. 4. Political calculations: With 2024 being an election year, some legislators might be cautious about supporting extremely restrictive measures. Considering all these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that both states will pass such legislation in their Senates, but it's far from certain."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

California is a leader in electric vehicle adoption and has a strong automotive industry presence. The state has a history of receiving significant federal funding for various initiatives. The timeframe (by July 2024) allows for about a year, which is a reasonable period for such grants to be awarded.

This law was later blocked by a federal court but demonstrates the state's stance on abortion. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a referendum by July 2024, which is only about a year away from the current date.

The index has never reached 3,500 points before, which suggests that reaching this level would be a significant milestone. 2. Current level: As of June 2023, the KOSPI was trading around 2,600 points. To reach 3,500 points, it would need to increase by approximately 35% in about 14 months. 3. Economic factors: South Korea's economy is heavily export-dependent, particularly in sectors like semiconductors, electronics, and automobiles. Global economic conditions, trade relations, and demand for these products will significantly impact the KOSPI's performance. 4. Geopolitical factors: Tensions with North Korea and global geopolitical issues can affect investor sentiment towards South Korean markets. 5. Monetary policy: The Bank of Korea's interest rate decisions and other monetary policies can influence stock market performance. 6. Global market trends: As a major Asian market, the KOSPI is influenced by global market trends, particularly those in the US and China. 7. Time frame: The question allows for a relatively long period (about 14 months) for the index to reach the target, increasing the chances of a positive outcome. 8. Intraday highs: The question specifies that intraday highs count for resolution, which slightly increases the probability of a positive outcome compared to requiring a closing price above 3,500. Given these factors, reaching 3,500 points is certainly possible but would require significant positive momentum. The KOSPI would need to outperform its historical growth rate and overcome potential economic headwinds. While the long time frame and inclusion of intraday highs increase the chances, the target still represents a substantial increase from current levels.

Public opinion: While Texas is a conservative state, extremely strict abortion laws might face public backlash, which could influence legislators. Given these factors, it seems likely that Texas will attempt to enact stricter abortion regulations. The Republican-controlled government has shown a consistent interest in restricting abortion access, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade provides them with more legal latitude to do so. However, there are some mitigating factors. Texas already has very strict abortion laws, so new regulations would need to be even more restrictive to qualify.

However, there are several factors that could lead to a resumption by July 2024: - Energy security concerns, especially in light of global geopolitical tensions - Pressure from the energy industry and potential economic benefits - Potential changes in political leadership or policy priorities Given these factors, there's a moderate to high chance of this condition being met. 2.

Current political climate in Georgia: Georgia is traditionally a conservative state, with Republicans controlling both the state legislature and the governor's office. The current political leadership is generally not supportive of expanding abortion rights. 2. Recent abortion legislation: In 2019, Georgia passed a 'heartbeat' bill, restricting abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. This law was initially blocked but went into effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 3. Public opinion: While Georgia is a conservative state, public opinion on abortion is mixed. National polls show that a majority of Americans support some level of abortion rights, but it's unclear if this translates to strong support for a referendum in Georgia specifically. 4. Timeframe: The question asks about a referendum by August 2024, which is a relatively short timeframe for organizing such a significant political event, especially if it's not already in the planning stages. 5. Precedent: Georgia does not have a strong history of using referendums for major policy decisions, particularly on controversial issues like abortion. 6. Legislative process: Initiating a referendum in Georgia typically requires action from the state legislature, which is currently controlled by conservatives who are unlikely to support such a measure. 7. Upcoming elections: The 2024 presidential election might influence political decisions, but it's more likely to discourage rather than encourage controversial measures like an abortion referendum. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Georgia will hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. The current political leadership is not inclined to support such a measure, and there's no indication of strong momentum for a referendum from other political forces within the state.

Current political climate: Pennsylvania is a swing state with a divided government. The state has a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, but the legislature is controlled by Republicans. This division makes it challenging to pass legislation or initiate referendums on controversial issues like abortion rights. 2. Existing abortion laws: Pennsylvania currently allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. While this is more permissive than some states, it's not as protected as abortion rights advocates would prefer. 3. Recent trends: There has been a nationwide push for states to codify abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. However, Pennsylvania has not been at the forefront of this movement. 4.

(a) Italian economy avoiding a recession: Italy's economy has been facing challenges, including high inflation, energy costs, and the broader European economic slowdown. However, recent data suggests some resilience: In Q3 2023, Italy's GDP grew by 0.1%, avoiding a technical recession. The government has implemented measures to support economic growth and mitigate energy costs. The European Central Bank's monetary policy is expected to become less restrictive in 2024, potentially supporting growth.

The Fed has been actively working to bring inflation down through interest rate hikes and other monetary policy tools. However, economic uncertainties, potential supply chain disruptions, or unexpected shocks could cause a spike in inflation. Given the Fed's commitment to controlling inflation and recent trends, a monthly increase exceeding 0.5% is possible but not highly likely. Let's estimate this probability at around 30%.

French presidential term length: The French presidential term is 5 years. Macron's current term began in 2022, so it's not scheduled to end until 2027. 3. Constitutional provisions for early termination: The French Constitution allows for early termination of a president's term under specific circumstances, such as resignation, impeachment, or death. However, there are no indications of any of these scenarios being likely. 4. Political stability: While France has experienced some social unrest and protests, there's no evidence suggesting a constitutional crisis or a situation that would force Macron to step down. 5. Time frame: The question asks about the appointment of a new president by August 2024, which is less than two years into Macron's second term. This is a relatively short period for such a significant political change. 6. Historical precedent: It's rare for French presidents to leave office before their term ends. The last time this happened was in 1969 when Charles de Gaulle resigned. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that France will appoint a new President by August 2024. There are no scheduled elections during this period, and barring any unforeseen extraordinary circumstances (such as a severe health crisis for Macron or a major political scandal), the current president is likely to remain in office. The probability of this event occurring is very low.

Global economic factors: International economic conditions, including actions by other major central banks like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, can influence the BoE's decisions. 5. Time horizon: The question is about August 2024, which is more than a year away. This long time frame increases uncertainty. 6.

Under normal circumstances, there would be no new President appointed before then. However, there are a few scenarios that could lead to a new appointment: 1. Macron resigns (unlikely without a major scandal or health issue) 2. Macron is impeached (very unlikely given the current political landscape) 3.

Current political landscape: Rishi Sunak is a Conservative Prime Minister, and while the House of Lords is not elected, it does have a significant number of Conservative peers.

Duration of previous Nipah outbreaks: Historically, Nipah virus outbreaks have been relatively short-lived, typically lasting a few weeks to a couple of months. This suggests that the current outbreak might be contained well before August 2024. 2. Time frame: The question provides a generous time frame of about 14 months from the creation date (June 30, 2024) to the resolution date (August 31, 2024). This extended period increases the likelihood of the outbreak being controlled and declared over. 3. WHO response: The WHO typically acts swiftly in response to such outbreaks, implementing control measures and working with local health authorities. Their prompt action increases the chances of containing the outbreak quickly. 4. Geographical spread: Nipah virus outbreaks are usually localized, which makes them easier to contain compared to more widespread pandemics. This factor favors a quicker resolution. 5. Existing knowledge and experience: Health authorities have experience dealing with Nipah virus from previous outbreaks, which should facilitate a more efficient response. 6. Potential for new outbreaks: While the current outbreak might be contained quickly, there's always a possibility of new outbreaks occurring within the given timeframe, which could delay the WHO's declaration. 7. Uncertainty factor: The question mentions 'heightened public health responses globally,' which might indicate a more severe or widespread outbreak than usual, potentially requiring more time to control. Considering these factors, it seems highly likely that the WHO will declare the Nipah virus outbreak over by August 2024. The extended timeframe, historical patterns of Nipah outbreaks, and the typically localized nature of these events all support this conclusion.

Current status: As of now (June 2023), I don't have specific information about an ongoing mpox outbreak in the Central African Republic. This could mean either there isn't a significant outbreak, or information about it is limited. 2. Historical context: The Central African Republic, like many African countries, has experienced mpox outbreaks in the past. However, these outbreaks are typically localized and controlled within a few months. 3. Time frame: The question gives a full year (from July 2023 to July 2024) for the outbreak to be declared over. This is a significant amount of time for public health measures to be implemented and take effect. 4. WHO and health authority involvement: The question mentions that either the country's health authorities or the WHO can declare the outbreak over. This increases the likelihood of an official declaration, as there are multiple entities that can make this determination. 5. Reporting requirement: The question requires the declaration to be reported by at least two reputable international news sources. Given the global attention on infectious diseases post-COVID-19, it's likely that such a declaration would receive media coverage. 6. Improvements in global health response: In recent years, there has been increased awareness and improved response to infectious disease outbreaks globally, which could lead to faster containment and declaration of the end of outbreaks. However, there are also factors that could potentially delay the declaration: 1. Limited healthcare infrastructure: The Central African Republic is a low-income country with limited healthcare resources, which could make it challenging to control an outbreak quickly. 2. Political instability: The country has faced political instability, which could potentially interfere with health interventions and official declarations. 3.

The WHO usually declares outbreaks over when there have been no new cases for a certain period, typically twice the incubation period of the virus.

The Bank Rate currently stands at 4.5% (as of May 2023). 2. Inflation outlook: The Bank of England's primary mandate is to maintain price stability, targeting a 2% inflation rate. If inflation shows signs of decreasing towards this target by early to mid-2024, it could pave the way for rate cuts. 3. Economic growth: The UK economy has been struggling with slow growth.

Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The long time frame increases the possibility, as it allows for potential changes in economic conditions. However, the current high inflation environment and the Bank's recent hawkish stance suggest that significant improvements in inflation would be needed before considering rate cuts. If inflation begins to show consistent decline towards the target rate and economic growth remains sluggish, the probability of a rate cut would increase.

While there's pressure to lower rates to stimulate economic growth, the BoE is cautious about inflation risks. However, by August 2024, more than a year from now, the economic landscape could change significantly.

The complete elimination of all export taxes on agricultural products is a significant policy shift that would require favorable domestic conditions and possibly international pressure. While India has shown willingness to adjust these policies, a complete elimination across all agricultural products is less likely. I'd estimate the probability of this event at around 30%.

Regulatory pressures: Sometimes, governments or regulatory bodies may pressure companies to allow generic production, especially for essential medicines. However, there's no mention of such pressure in the question or recent news. 5. Separate decisions: The question requires both companies to make this decision independently. The probability of this happening is the product of the individual probabilities, which makes it even less likely. 6. Patent life cycles: Without knowing the specific drugs or their patent statuses, it's difficult to determine if either drug is nearing the end of its patent protection, which might incentivize voluntary licensing. 7. Public health considerations: In some cases, companies might allow generic production for humanitarian reasons, especially in developing countries. However, this is relatively rare and usually doesn't apply globally. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that both Astellas and AstraZeneca would independently decide to allow generic production of their respective cancer drugs within such a short timeframe.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the ECB will announce a rate cut by July 2024. The primary reason is that inflation, while declining, is still above target, and the ECB has consistently emphasized its commitment to price stability. Additionally, the ECB typically moves slowly in changing policy direction, and the time frame until July 2024 is relatively short for such a significant shift.

(a) European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate cut: As of June 2023, the ECB has been on a rate-hiking cycle to combat inflation. However, by July 2024, there's a possibility that economic conditions might change, potentially necessitating a rate cut. Factors to consider: Inflation trends: If inflation shows signs of significantly cooling down by early 2024, it could prompt the ECB to consider rate cuts. Economic growth: If the Eurozone faces economic slowdown or recession, it might push the ECB towards monetary easing. Global economic conditions: Changes in global economic landscape could influence ECB's decision. Given these factors, there's a moderate chance of an ECB rate cut by July 2024, but it's far from certain. I'd estimate this probability at around 40%.

Economic conditions: The state of the global and South Korean economy could influence both the company's and workers' positions. Industry trends: Shifts in the automotive industry (e.g., towards electric vehicles) might impact labor negotiations. Given Hyundai's experience in handling such situations and the relatively long timeframe (by July 2024), the probability of resolving a major strike (if one occurs) is fairly high. I'd estimate this at around 75%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.40 * 0.75 = 0.30 or 30%. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent. Economic conditions affecting the ECB's decision might also influence labor relations at Hyundai.

(a) Philippine government enforcing a shutdown of Chinese-run online trading platforms: The Philippines has been cracking down on illegal online gambling operations, many of which are run by Chinese nationals. However, shutting down 50% of these platforms is a significant action that would require substantial political will and resources. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a large-scale operation. There might be economic considerations, as these platforms likely contribute to the Philippine economy. The requirement for confirmation by reputable international news organizations adds another layer of complexity. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of this event occurring to be around 0.4. (b) IMF announcing new funding commitments: The IMF regularly provides funding to countries, especially in response to economic crises or significant needs. Given the current global economic climate, it is plausible that the IMF could announce new funding commitments exceeding $400 million. However, the requirement for these commitments to be new initiatives or significant expansions limits the probability. Considering these aspects, I estimate the probability of this event occurring to be around 0.6. To find the joint probability of both events occurring, we can multiply the individual probabilities, assuming some degree of independence. Therefore, the combined probability is approximately 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24.

The FDA has already granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to MDMA for PTSD treatment, which can expedite the review process. Several Phase 3 clinical trials have been completed or are nearing completion, with positive results reported. However, the FDA approval process is rigorous and can be unpredictable. While there's significant momentum, the August 2024 deadline is relatively soon for a novel treatment. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at about 60%. 2. Mexican authorities declaring the dismantling of La Familia Michoacana by July 2024: La Familia Michoacana is a well-established drug cartel in Mexico, and completely dismantling such organizations is extremely challenging. While Mexican authorities have had some successes against cartels in the past, complete dismantling is rare. The timeline of just over a year from now is relatively short for such a significant achievement. Moreover, even if significant progress is made, authorities might be hesitant to declare a complete dismantling due to the potential for the cartel to reorganize or for splinter groups to emerge. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at about 15%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.15 = 0.09 or 9%.

However, there's a possibility they might delay their endorsement due to political considerations or internal processes. Combining these factors: The first event (Biden's speech) seems unlikely due to the specific requirements and short timeframe. The second event (UFCW endorsement) is more likely but not certain.

Factors that could influence increased demand include: 1. Successful marketing campaigns 2. New product launches under the Tostitos brand 3. Changes in consumer preferences towards snack foods 4.

A sudden reversal to cutting rates within a year would be unusual unless economic conditions change dramatically. 3.

This provides some time for economic conditions to change, potentially necessitating a rate cut. 5. Historical precedent: The RBA tends to move interest rates gradually. A shift from raising rates to cutting them within a year would be relatively quick by historical standards. 6. Inflation targets: The RBA aims to keep inflation between 2-3%. If inflation falls below this range, it could prompt a rate cut. 7. Labor market conditions: If unemployment rises significantly, it could push the RBA towards cutting rates to stimulate the economy. 8. Housing market: Australia's housing market is sensitive to interest rates. A severe downturn in this sector could prompt the RBA to cut rates. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the RBA will cut rates by July 2024. The current inflationary environment and the RBA's recent tightening cycle suggest that a rate cut is not imminent. However, economic conditions can change rapidly, and there is still a significant time frame for unexpected developments to occur. While a rate cut seems unlikely, it's not impossible.

Likelihood of Harris running for president: For Harris to announce a running mate, she would need to be running for president herself. This would only happen if Biden decided not to run for re-election or if he were to step down for some reason. While there has been speculation about Biden's age and health, he has consistently stated his intention to run for re-election. 3. Timing: Even if Harris were to become the Democratic nominee, announcing a running mate in August 2024 would be unusually late in the election cycle. Typically, running mates are announced in July or early August. 4. Location specificity: The question requires the announcement to be made at a rally in San Diego.

New York unionization efforts: In October 2022, workers at the Apple store in the World Trade Center in New York City filed for a union election.

Before the pandemic, claims above 275,000 were rare outside of recessions. 3. Economic outlook: While there are concerns about a potential recession, many economists predict a 'soft landing' or mild recession at worst. The Federal Reserve's actions to combat inflation could lead to some job market cooling, but a dramatic spike in unemployment is not the base case scenario. 4. Time frame: The question allows for over a year (from now until August 2024) for this event to occur, which increases the chances of economic fluctuations or unexpected events. 5. Threshold: 275,000 is a significant number, but not an extremely high one. It's about 10% higher than current levels, which could be reached without a severe economic downturn. 6. Consecutive weeks requirement: The need for two consecutive weeks above 275,000 makes the condition slightly more stringent, as it rules out one-off spikes. 7. Seasonal factors: Jobless claims can spike temporarily due to seasonal factors (like holiday retail layoffs), but these are usually accounted for in the data. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of this occurring. The extended time frame and the relatively achievable threshold increase the likelihood. However, the current strong job market and the requirement for consecutive weeks above 275,000 decrease the probability."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "475ec208-76f5-4cf0-9aa4-ea1856eb2620", "title": "Will both of the following occur by August 2024: (a) The Bank of Korea announces a reduction in its key interest rate, and (b) U.S. weekly jobless claims exceed 275,000 for two consecutive weeks?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following occur by August 31, 2024: (a) The Bank of Korea publicly announces a reduction in its key interest rate.

As of 2023, Washington had already expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Without specific recent data on the current enrollment numbers or growth rate, it's difficult to determine if reaching 450,000 new enrollees by July 2024 is likely. This target seems ambitious but not impossible, especially if there are ongoing efforts to increase enrollment. b) Reserve Bank of Australia announcing an interest rate cut: As of mid-2023, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had been raising interest rates to combat inflation. For the RBA to cut rates by July 2024, there would need to be a significant shift in economic conditions. This could happen if inflation comes under control and economic growth slows. However, given the current global economic uncertainties and the lag in monetary policy effects, it's not highly probable that the RBA will reverse course and cut rates within a year, unless there's a dramatic economic downturn.

Conditional marketing approval: The question specifically asks about conditional marketing approval, which the EMA may grant for medicines that address unmet medical needs. Alzheimer's disease certainly falls into this category, potentially expediting the approval process. 5. Urgency of Alzheimer's treatment: Given the significant burden of Alzheimer's disease and the limited treatment options available, there may be pressure on the EMA to expedite the review process for promising treatments like Leqembi. 6. Previous Alzheimer's drug approvals: The EMA has been cautious with Alzheimer's treatments in the past. For example, they initially rejected Biogen's previous Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm, which may indicate a more thorough review process for Leqembi. 7. Time frame: The question asks about approval by July 2024, which gives approximately 18 months from the FDA approval date. This timeframe aligns with the typical EMA review process duration. 8. Biogen's experience: Biogen has experience navigating the EMA approval process, which may help streamline the application and review process for Leqembi. Considering these factors, there is a good chance that Leqembi will receive conditional marketing approval from the EMA by July 2024. The drug's FDA approval, promising clinical trial results, and the urgent need for Alzheimer's treatments work in its favor.

It received accelerated approval from the FDA in January 2023 and full approval in July 2023. Given this progress in the US, it's likely that Biogen will pursue approval in Europe as well. The EMA typically takes 12-18 months to review new drug applications. If Biogen submitted their application shortly after receiving FDA approval, it's possible that the EMA could make a decision by July 2024. However, the EMA's process can be more conservative than the FDA's, and they may require additional data or have more concerns about the drug's efficacy and safety profile.

China, where Alibaba is based, has strict controls on labor unions and strikes, making large-scale labor actions less common than in some other countries. The conditions for this event are quite specific (1,000+ workers, lasting at least a week, official statements, international coverage), which makes it less likely to occur. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of this event occurring by July 2024 to be relatively low, around 15%. (b) Large protests in Indonesia in response to religious freedom legislation: Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim-majority country with a history of religious tensions and occasional protests related to religious issues. The country has seen protests related to religious freedom in the past, particularly concerning the treatment of religious minorities. However, the requirement for large protests (1,000+ participants) specifically in response to new religious freedom legislation makes this event more specific and less likely. The timeframe (by July 2024) provides a relatively short period for new legislation to be proposed, debated, and potentially passed, triggering such protests. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of this event occurring by July 2024 to be moderate, around 30%.

This is a relatively short period for complex legal proceedings, especially those involving constitutional issues. 2. Nature of the lawsuit: The case involves a conservative law firm challenging a state initiative targeting crisis pregnancy centers. Such cases often involve constitutional questions related to free speech or religious freedom, which can be complex and time-consuming to resolve. 3.

This process can easily extend beyond a year, especially if there are appeals. 4. Precedent: Similar lawsuits in other states have often taken considerable time to resolve. For example, the Supreme Court case NIFLA v. Becerra, which dealt with crisis pregnancy centers in California, took about three years from initial filing to final resolution. 5. Potential for appeals: Even if a lower court reaches a decision before August 2024, there's a high likelihood that either party would appeal an unfavorable ruling, extending the litigation process. 6.

Time frame: We have approximately 13 months (from the creation date to the resolution date) for this pattern to emerge. 2. Current market conditions: The U.S. housing market has been experiencing challenges due to high interest rates and inflation, which have dampened home sales. 3. Economic projections: Many economists expect interest rates to potentially decrease in 2024, which could stimulate home buying activity. 4. Seasonal patterns: Real estate typically has seasonal fluctuations, with spring and summer months often showing increased activity. 5. Pent-up demand: There may be pent-up demand from potential buyers who have been waiting for more favorable conditions. 6. Historical precedent: While three consecutive months of increases is not extremely common, it's not rare either, especially during periods of economic recovery or changing market conditions. 7. Reporting frequency: The National Association of Realtors releases monthly reports, providing ample opportunities to observe trends. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of seeing three consecutive months of increases in previously occupied home sales by July 2024. The potential for interest rate cuts in 2024 could be a significant catalyst for increased buying activity. Additionally, if the economy shows signs of improvement, consumer confidence could boost home purchases. However, there are also risks to consider. The housing market could remain sluggish if economic conditions don't improve as expected, or if other factors (like continued high home prices) counteract the positive effects of potentially lower interest rates.

As of mid-2023, the U.S. housing market has been experiencing a slowdown due to high interest rates and inflation. However, by 2024, there's a possibility of improvement: 1. The Federal Reserve may lower interest rates by then, making mortgages more affordable. 2. Inflation might stabilize, increasing consumer confidence. 3. Pent-up demand from buyers who were priced out of the market might lead to increased sales. However, three consecutive months of increase is a specific requirement that may be challenging to meet. Housing markets often fluctuate month-to-month, and consistent growth for three months straight is not guaranteed. (b) Medicare's negotiated drug prices include a major cholesterol medication by August 2024: The Biden administration has been pushing for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, which is a significant policy change: 1. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows Medicare to negotiate prices for certain high-cost drugs. 2. The first set of negotiated prices is set to take effect in 2026, with the process beginning earlier. 3. Cholesterol medications are common and often expensive, making them likely candidates for negotiation. However, the specific inclusion of a major cholesterol medication by August 2024 is not certain: 1. The negotiation process is complex and may face legal challenges from pharmaceutical companies. 2. The timeline for implementing these changes is tight, and delays are possible. 3. While cholesterol medications are likely candidates, there's no guarantee a major one will be included in the first round of negotiations.

As of late 2023, France has managed to avoid a recession, with modest growth projections for 2024. The European Central Bank's monetary policies and government fiscal measures are aimed at supporting economic growth. However, there are risks such as high inflation, energy price volatility, and potential global economic slowdowns that could impact France's economy.

While inflation has been trending downward, it remains above the central bank's target. Given the volatility in global commodity prices, especially energy and food, and potential currency fluctuations, it's quite possible that there could be at least one month between October 2023 and July 2024 where inflation exceeds 0.5% month-over-month. However, as the central bank continues its efforts to control inflation, this becomes less likely over time. Let's estimate this probability at around 60%.

Drone delivery projects are complex and often face regulatory hurdles. 2. The Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas is not known for large-scale technological projects. 3.

The question is set for August 2024, which is more than a year away. 2. The WHO tends to be cautious in declaring outbreaks over. 3. There's no recent indication of a major resurgence of Zika. I estimate the probability of this condition being met at about 0.7 or 70%. (b) Global Fund announcing new funding commitments over $400 million by July 2024: The Global Fund is a major international organization that regularly makes large funding commitments. Considering that: 1. The Global Fund's 2023-2025 funding cycle aims to raise $18 billion. 2. They frequently announce new initiatives and funding commitments. 3. $400 million, while a significant amount, is not unusually large for the Global Fund. 4. The timeframe (by July 2024) gives ample opportunity for such an announcement. I estimate the probability of this condition being met at about 0.8 or 80%. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56. Therefore, I estimate the probability of both conditions being met at 0.56 or 56%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.10831672693974093, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03610557564658031, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4700748217132436, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This decision aligns with a pro-choice stance and reflects the current legal position in Illinois. 2. Political climate: Illinois is generally considered a Democratic-leaning state, with a history of supporting abortion rights. The current Governor, J.B. Pritzker, is a Democrat and has been vocal about protecting abortion rights in the state. 3. Time frame: The question asks about the situation by July 2024, which is only about a year from the time of the 2023 decision. Major legal changes typically take time, especially when involving constitutional issues. 4. Composition of the Illinois Supreme Court: The court's composition is unlikely to change significantly in such a short period, barring unexpected retirements or other events. 5. National context: While some states have been restricting abortion access, Illinois has positioned itself as a haven for abortion rights in the Midwest. This stance is likely to continue given the state's political leanings. 6. Public opinion: Illinois residents generally support abortion rights, which would make a dramatic reversal of the court's decision politically unpopular. 7. Legal precedent: The 2023 decision itself creates a legal precedent that would need to be overcome for a reversal, which is a high bar in such a short timeframe. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that Illinois will maintain its current legal stance on abortion access by July 2024. The recent court decision, the state's political climate, the short timeframe, and the general support for abortion rights in Illinois all point towards maintaining the status quo. While it's never possible to predict with absolute certainty, especially in matters of law and politics, the probability of maintaining the current stance appears to be very high."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "731e243e-340f-47ab-864e-7d7ca16b617c", "title": "Will the HHS's rule on telehealth services be enacted by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by August 31, 2024, a new Department of Health and Human Services rule specifically targeting the regulation of telehealth services is enacted through legal or administrative means.

HHS priorities: The Department of Health and Human Services has shown interest in telehealth regulation. In recent years, they have issued guidance and temporary waivers related to telehealth, indicating it's an area of focus. 4. Legislative pressure: There has been bipartisan support for expanding and regulating telehealth services, which could push the HHS to act on this matter. 5.

Illinois maintaining its current legal stance on abortion access by July 2024: Illinois has been known for its strong pro-choice stance, and in 2023, the Illinois Supreme Court struck down laws that strictly regulated abortion providers. Given the state's history and recent court decision, it seems unlikely that there would be a significant reversal in such a short timeframe (by July 2024). The political climate in Illinois generally supports abortion rights, and any attempt to reverse the 2023 decision would likely face strong opposition. Therefore, this condition has a high probability of being met. 2. HHS's rule on telehealth services being enacted by August 2024: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been working on various telehealth regulations, especially in light of the increased use of telehealth services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the enactment of new federal rules can be a complex and time-consuming process. While there is a clear need for updated telehealth regulations, the specific timeline for enactment is less certain. The process involves proposal, public comment periods, revisions, and final approval, which can take varying amounts of time. Given the importance of telehealth and the current administration's focus on healthcare access, there's a moderate chance this could be accomplished by August 2024, but it's not guaranteed. Combining these two conditions: For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. The first condition regarding Illinois seems highly likely, while the second condition about the HHS rule is less certain but still possible.

Pennsylvania tax reform referendum by August 31, 2024: - Pennsylvania does not have a history of frequent statewide referendums on tax reform. - The timeframe is slightly longer (about two months from the question's creation date), but still quite short for organizing a statewide referendum. - While tax reform is an important issue, there are no current indications of Pennsylvania planning such a specific referendum. Considering these factors: - The probability of New York holding a marijuana legalization referendum is extremely low, given that it's already legal and there's no apparent need for such a vote. - The probability of Pennsylvania holding a tax reform referendum is also low, due to the short timeframe and lack of current plans or discussions about such a referendum.

However, declaring an outbreak 'over' typically requires a significant period without new cases. Given that we're looking at a timeframe until July 2024, which is about a year from now, there's a reasonable chance that Nigeria could bring the outbreak under control.

(a) U.S. Senate passing a bill to cut NASA's budget by more than 20%: This is highly unlikely for several reasons: 1. NASA's budget has generally been stable or increasing in recent years, with bipartisan support for space exploration and research. 2. A 20% cut would be drastic and would likely face significant opposition from both parties. 3. The timeline (by August 2024) is very short for such a major budget change to be proposed, debated, and passed. 4. There are no current indications or proposals for such a significant cut to NASA's budget. I would estimate the probability of this event occurring as very low, around 0.05 or 5%. (b) New York holding a referendum on climate change policy: This is also unlikely, but more plausible than the NASA budget cut: 1. New York has been proactive in addressing climate change, but typically through legislative action rather than referendums. 2. Statewide referendums are relatively rare in New York. 3. The timeline (by August 2024) is tight for organizing a statewide referendum, especially if it's not already in the planning stages. 4.

However, if economic growth remains weak and inflation continues to fall, the pressure to cut rates will increase. The relatively short time frame (until July 2024) somewhat reduces the probability, as it doesn't allow for a long period of economic assessment. However, if inflation falls faster than expected or if there are signs of economic distress, the BoE might act more quickly.

(a) Bank of England interest rate cut by August 2024: The Bank of England has been maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation. However, as we approach mid-2024, there's a possibility that inflationary pressures might ease, allowing for a rate cut. The exact timing is uncertain, but several factors support the likelihood of a cut by August 2024: 1. The typical lag in monetary policy effects means current high rates might have sufficiently cooled the economy by then. 2. Global economic conditions might necessitate stimulus measures. 3. Political pressure for economic growth ahead of a potential UK general election. However, if inflation remains persistent or other economic factors warrant continued tightening, a rate cut might be delayed. I estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 60%.

Michigan holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: This condition is more likely to be met, but still faces some challenges: - Michigan already held a referendum on abortion rights in November 2022, which resulted in the right to abortion being enshrined in the state constitution. - Given this recent referendum, there might be less urgency or perceived need for another one so soon. - However, the political landscape around abortion rights remains contentious, and there could be efforts to further clarify or modify the existing constitutional amendment. - Michigan has a history of using referendums, so the mechanism is familiar and available. The probability of this condition being met is higher than the first, perhaps around 30-40%. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities. Even if we take the higher estimates for both (10% for the ethics code and 40% for the Michigan referendum), the combined probability would be 0.10 * 0.40 = 0.04 or 4%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.003537665444609317, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0011792218148697724, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08233869695926183, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Time frame: The question provides a two-month window from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a relatively short period for complex negotiations, especially considering the potential size of the fine and the legal complexities involved. 3. Google's approach to regulatory issues: Google generally tries to maintain good relationships with regulators and often seeks to resolve issues through settlements rather than prolonged legal battles. 4. UK regulatory environment: The UK has been increasingly assertive in regulating tech companies, especially post-Brexit. This might make the UK authority more inclined to push for a settlement to demonstrate effective enforcement. 5. Potential fine size: Without knowing the specific amount of the fine, it's hard to gauge how likely Google is to settle. Very large fines might be more likely to be contested, while smaller ones might be settled more readily. 6. Public relations: Settling quickly could be in Google's interest to minimize negative publicity and demonstrate cooperation with regulators. 7. Complexity of the alleged violations: Depending on the nature and complexity of the alleged data protection violations, negotiations might be more or less complicated, affecting the likelihood of reaching a settlement within the given timeframe. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance of a settlement being reached. The main factors in favor of a settlement are Google's history of settling similar cases, their general approach to regulatory issues, and the potential PR benefits of a quick resolution.

Magnitude of the tariff: A 50% or higher tariff is quite substantial and would significantly impact trade. Such a high tariff might face resistance from member states concerned about rising costs for solar installations and potential retaliation from China. 5. Specific targeting: The requirement for the tariff to be specifically targeted at Chinese-made solar panels, rather than part of a broader measure, makes it a more focused and potentially contentious action. 6. Global context: The push for renewable energy to combat climate change might make some EU members hesitant to impose such high tariffs on solar panels, as it could slow down the adoption of solar technology. 7.

The timeframe of about 14 months (from now until August 2024) is reasonable for negotiations and reaching a settlement.

(b) European Commission implementing a significant tariff on Chinese-made solar panels: This is a more complex and less likely scenario. The EU has previously imposed anti-dumping measures on Chinese solar panels, but these were phased out in 2018. Reimposing such high tariffs (50% or higher) would be a significant policy shift. It would likely face opposition from EU member states and companies benefiting from cheaper Chinese panels. Moreover, it could escalate trade tensions with China and potentially violate WTO rules. The EU is generally moving towards more sustainable energy solutions, which might make them hesitant to significantly increase the cost of solar panels. This part seems unlikely.

Nature of the case: This is a high-profile case involving a sensitive topic (abortion) in a state (Texas) known for its strict abortion laws. Such cases often attract significant public attention and can be politically charged. 3. Incentives for settlement: a) For the plaintiff (the Texas woman): A settlement could provide quicker resolution and compensation without the stress and uncertainty of a full trial. b) For the defendants (local sheriff and prosecutors): Settling could help avoid negative publicity and potential precedent-setting court decisions. 4. Legal complexities: The case involves constitutional rights and the interpretation of state laws, which can be complex and time-consuming to litigate fully. 5. Recent trends: There has been increased scrutiny of abortion-related cases nationwide, which might encourage authorities to settle rather than risk a high-profile trial. 6. Political climate: The case is occurring during a presidential election year (2024), which could increase pressure for a resolution to avoid it becoming a campaign issue. 7. Potential for appeals: If the case goes to trial, any decision could be appealed, potentially dragging out the process beyond the resolution date. This might incentivize both parties to seek a settlement. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high likelihood of a settlement being reached. The sensitive nature of the case, the potential for negative publicity for the authorities, and the mutual benefits of avoiding a lengthy trial all point towards a settlement as a favorable outcome for both parties. However, the complexity of the legal issues and the potential for the case to be used as a test case for broader abortion rights could work against a quick settlement. Additionally, if either party believes they have a strong case, they might be less inclined to settle.

The government may view the crypto ban as a way to maintain control over the financial system and protect the Naira. 5. Global trends: While many countries are moving towards regulating cryptocurrencies rather than outright banning them, Nigeria has shown resistance to this trend so far. 6. Pressure from crypto advocates: There is ongoing pressure from the crypto community and some segments of the population to reverse the ban, which could potentially influence the government's decision. 7. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC): Nigeria launched its own CBDC, the eNaira, in October 2021. The government may be inclined to maintain the crypto ban to promote the adoption of its official digital currency. 8. Timeframe: The question asks about maintaining the ban through August 2024, which is only about two months after the question's creation date. Significant policy changes often take time to implement, making it less likely for a reversal to occur in such a short period. Considering these factors, it seems more likely than not that Nigeria will maintain its ban on cryptocurrency transactions through August 2024. The government has shown a strong commitment to this policy, and the short timeframe makes a policy reversal less probable. However, there is still a possibility of change due to global trends and internal pressure."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d4c6b7cd-7317-4333-b754-37c962e35589", "title": "Will Russia's Federation Council pass a major economic reform bill opposed by President Putin by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, Russia's Federation Council passes a major economic reform bill that is explicitly opposed by President Vladimir Putin or his administration.

Historical precedent: There is little to no precedent for the Federation Council passing major legislation opposed by Putin. The Russian political system has been designed to support Putin's agenda, with checks and balances significantly weakened. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a period from now until August 2024, which is a relatively short time frame for such a significant political shift to occur. 4. Current political climate: As of now, there are no signs of major dissent within the Russian political elite or the Federation Council that would suggest a willingness to oppose Putin on major economic issues. 5. Economic pressures: While Russia is facing economic challenges due to international sanctions and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, these pressures have historically led to a tightening of control rather than a loosening of Putin's grip on power. 6. Succession planning: As Putin approaches the end of his current term, there might be some jockeying for power, but it's unlikely to manifest in such a direct challenge to his authority. 7. Media reporting: The requirement for international media reporting adds another layer of difficulty, as Russian control over information flow might make it challenging for such opposition to be widely reported. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the Federation Council would pass a major economic reform bill opposed by Putin. The Russian political system is not set up for such independent action by the legislative branch, especially on major economic issues. The only scenario where this might occur is if there was a sudden and dramatic shift in Russian politics, such as a severe health crisis for Putin or an unexpected loss of support from key power brokers.

Nigeria's cryptocurrency ban: Nigeria implemented a ban on cryptocurrency transactions in February 2021. While there has been some pushback from the crypto community and calls for regulation rather than an outright ban, the government has maintained its stance. However, the crypto market continues to grow in Nigeria despite the ban, which might put pressure on the government to reconsider its position. Given the timeframe (until August 2024) and the global trend towards crypto regulation rather than outright bans, there's a moderate chance that Nigeria might revise its stance. I'd estimate the probability of Nigeria maintaining its ban through August 2024 at about 60%. 2. Russia's Federation Council passing a major economic reform bill opposed by Putin: This condition is much less likely to occur. The Russian political system is heavily centralized around President Putin, and the Federation Council generally aligns with his policies. For a major economic reform bill to pass despite Putin's opposition would be highly unusual and would suggest a significant shift in Russian politics. Such a scenario could potentially occur if there were extreme economic pressures or internal political changes, but given Putin's continued strong grip on power, this seems unlikely. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring by August 2024 at around 10%. To resolve as YES, both conditions must be met.

(a) Indonesian economy avoiding recession: Indonesia has shown resilience in recent years, with its economy growing steadily. According to the World Bank, Indonesia's GDP growth was 5.3% in 2022 and is projected to be around 4.9% in 2023. The country has a large domestic market, diverse exports, and has been implementing economic reforms. However, global economic uncertainties, including potential slowdowns in major economies like China and the US, could impact Indonesia's growth. The timeframe (October 2023 to July 2024) is relatively short, which reduces the risk of a sudden downturn. Given Indonesia's recent economic performance and outlook, the probability of avoiding a recession by July 2024 is quite high, perhaps around 0.85.

The WHO has effective protocols for managing measles outbreaks, including vaccination campaigns. However, the question mentions a global response, suggesting this outbreak is more severe than usual. The timeframe (by August 2024) provides a considerable period for control measures to take effect. Still, declaring an outbreak 'over' globally can be complex due to varying situations in different countries. Given the WHO's experience with measles and the timeframe provided, the probability of this condition being met is moderate to high, perhaps around 0.70.

Paramount's strategy: The company has been focusing on streaming growth, and sports content is a key driver for attracting and retaining subscribers. 6. Competition: Other major players like Amazon, Apple, and traditional networks are also competing for sports rights, which could make it challenging for Paramount to secure a new deal. 7. Economic factors: The current economic climate might influence spending on expensive sports rights deals. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of Paramount announcing a new major sports media partnership by July 2024. The company has shown interest in sports content, but the short timeframe and competitive landscape make it challenging. However, Paramount might be motivated to strengthen its sports offerings to boost its streaming services."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "75e896a6-926c-4741-8d99-aaa6513d215e", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) A joint sports streaming venture by major media companies will launch by August 2024, and (2) Paramount will announce a new major sports media partnership by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following conditions are met: \n\n1.

ESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery are major players in sports broadcasting, and they might see value in joining forces for a sports-specific streaming service. However, such ventures are complex and take time to negotiate and implement. The timeline of just over a year (from now to August 2024) is tight for such a major initiative. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 40%. 2. Paramount announcing a new major sports media partnership by July 2024: Paramount (formerly ViacomCBS) is actively involved in sports broadcasting and has been known to pursue sports rights aggressively. They already have partnerships with several major sports leagues and events. The media landscape is constantly evolving, and companies are always looking for new opportunities to secure valuable sports content. Given the timeframe of about a year, it's quite possible that Paramount could announce a new partnership. However, major sports rights don't become available that frequently. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.40 * 0.60 = 0.24 or 24%.

The probability of this occurring is also relatively high, perhaps around 0.70. For both events to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities: 0.75 * 0.70 = 0.525. However, we should consider that these events are not entirely independent. A global economic slowdown could affect both the Australian economy and the U.S. housing market, potentially increasing the likelihood of both events occurring together.

This process can take several months to years, depending on the disease and its spread. 5. Global vaccination efforts: The effectiveness and speed of vaccination campaigns worldwide will play a crucial role in controlling the outbreak. However, implementing widespread vaccination programs, especially in areas with limited healthcare infrastructure, can be time-consuming. 6.

(a) Polio outbreak declaration: The World Health Organization (WHO) has been working diligently to eradicate polio globally. However, recent outbreaks have posed challenges. As of now, there are still some countries reporting polio cases, and the WHO has not yet declared the current outbreak over. The timeline until August 2024 gives about 14 months for the situation to improve. While this is a reasonable amount of time for progress, completely eradicating an outbreak and officially declaring it over within this timeframe might be ambitious. The WHO is typically cautious in making such declarations to ensure no resurgence occurs. I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 60%. (b) Indonesian economy avoiding recession: Indonesia has historically shown resilience in its economic growth. As one of the largest economies in Southeast Asia, it has maintained positive growth rates even during global economic challenges. The country has a diverse economy, which helps in mitigating risks. However, global economic uncertainties, including potential slowdowns in major economies and geopolitical tensions, could impact Indonesia's growth.

Frequency of salmonella outbreaks: Salmonella outbreaks do occur regularly in the United States, but linking them to specific companies is less common. According to CDC data, there are usually several salmonella outbreaks investigated each year, but not all are linked to specific companies. 4. Recent history: The question specifies that this must be a new outbreak, different from any previously reported ones. This suggests that Fresh Fields Inc. may have had outbreaks in the past, which could indicate a higher risk for future outbreaks. 5. Regulatory oversight: The requirement for U.S. federal health officials to confirm the link suggests a thorough investigation process, which can take time. 6. Reporting requirements: The need for at least two reputable news sources to report on the outbreak adds another layer of verification, which could potentially delay the official linking of the company to the outbreak. Given these factors, I believe the probability is relatively low. The short time frame is the most limiting factor, as investigations and official announcements often take longer than a month. However, if Fresh Fields Inc. has a history of outbreaks, this could increase the likelihood of quick identification and reporting."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "b90bd9ff-29c2-4e74-aa90-e08946bf1694", "title": "Will the U.S. Senate pass a bill to increase the FDA's budget by more than 20% by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, the United States Senate passes a bill that includes an increase of more than 20% in the budget of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compared to its current fiscal year's budget.

This political alignment is generally more favorable to LGBTQ+ rights and could potentially support legislation modifying restrictions on transgender youth healthcare. 2. Existing restrictions: It's important to note that Michigan does not currently have strict statewide bans on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, unlike some other states. This means any new law would likely be aimed at protecting or expanding access to care, rather than restricting it further. 3. Timeline: The question's resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is more than a year away from the creation date.

Sony might want to signal its commitment to AI to attract top talent. 8. Previous announcements: Sony has made similar announcements in the past about expanding in strategic areas, which suggests they're not averse to publicly stating their intentions. However, there are also factors that could reduce the likelihood: 1. Potential for keeping plans confidential: Sony might choose to increase its AI workforce without making a public announcement. 2. Alternative strategies: Sony might opt for partnerships or acquisitions rather than increasing its in-house workforce. 3. Short timeframe for the question: The resolution date is only a month after the question is created, which is a relatively short window for such an announcement. Considering these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high likelihood that Sony will make such an announcement.

Global economic conditions: The world is currently facing inflationary pressures, but there are signs of easing in some countries. 2. South Korea's economic situation: The country's economy is export-dependent and sensitive to global trends. 3.

Recent monetary policy trends: The Central Bank of Brazil has been maintaining a relatively high Selic rate to combat inflation. As of June 2023, the Selic rate stands at 13.75%, which is quite high compared to other major economies. 3. Inflation outlook: Brazil's inflation rate has been declining, reaching 4.18% in April 2023, down from double-digit levels in 2022. If this trend continues, it could provide room for interest rate cuts. 4.

Given these factors, there are strong indications that the Central Bank of Brazil might cut interest rates by July 2024: 1. The declining inflation trend, if sustained, would reduce the need for high interest rates. 2. Political pressure for lower rates to boost economic growth is likely to continue. 3. The extended time frame (over a year) allows for multiple opportunities for rate decisions. 4. Global economic conditions might stabilize, potentially allowing for more accommodative monetary policy. However, there are also factors that could prevent or delay a rate cut: 1. Unexpected economic shocks or a resurgence of inflation could force the central bank to maintain high rates. 2. The central bank might opt for a cautious approach, preferring to ensure inflation is firmly under control before cutting rates.

Given these factors, it seems quite likely that Indiana will attempt to enact stricter regulations on abortion providers. The state has shown a clear intent to restrict abortion access, and the specific nature of the question aligns with common legislative strategies in conservative states.

(a) New Jersey holding a referendum on abortion rights: New Jersey is currently a state with strong protections for abortion rights. In January 2022, Governor Phil Murphy signed the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, which codified the right to abortion into state law. Given this recent action, there might be less urgency for a constitutional amendment. However, some advocates argue that a constitutional amendment would provide even stronger protection. As of now, there are no concrete plans announced for such a referendum. The process of getting a referendum on the ballot in New Jersey is complex and time-consuming, typically requiring legislative approval or a petition process. With only about a year left until the resolution date, and no current public discussion about such a referendum, the likelihood of this occurring seems low. (b) Indiana enacting new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers: Indiana has a history of enacting strict abortion laws. In August 2022, Indiana passed a near-total abortion ban, which was later blocked by the courts. This demonstrates the state's willingness to enact strict abortion regulations. However, the question specifically asks about regulations that are stricter for abortion providers compared to other healthcare providers. While it's possible that Indiana might attempt to pass such targeted regulations, they would likely face legal challenges under the equal protection clause. Additionally, with the recent history of legal challenges to their abortion laws, Indiana lawmakers might be more cautious in their approach. However, given the state's track record, there's still a moderate possibility of this occurring. Combining these factors: For both events to occur, we need both a relatively unlikely event (the New Jersey referendum) and a moderately possible event (Indiana's new regulations) to happen within a relatively short timeframe. The probability of both occurring is necessarily lower than the probability of either individual event. Given the lack of current movement towards a referendum in New Jersey and the legal challenges that Indiana might face in enacting provider-specific regulations, I would estimate the probability of both events occurring by July 2024 to be relatively low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Arizona holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024: Arizona is a politically divided state, and abortion rights are a contentious issue. There's growing national momentum for putting abortion rights on ballots following the Dobbs decision. However, organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that requires significant time and resources. The deadline (July 2024) is relatively soon, which reduces the likelihood of this occurring. There's no current strong indication that Arizona is actively planning such a referendum. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 0.2 or 20%. 2. Wisconsin's near-total abortion ban being declared constitutional by August 2024: Wisconsin's abortion ban is a pre-Roe law from 1849 that became potentially enforceable after the Dobbs decision. The law has been challenged in court, and its status is currently uncertain. Wisconsin has a liberal-leaning Supreme Court, which makes it less likely for the ban to be upheld. The August 2024 deadline gives some time for the legal process, but court decisions can be unpredictable and take longer. Given the current political climate and the composition of Wisconsin's courts, it seems unlikely that the ban would be declared fully constitutional. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 0.15 or 15%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 or 3%.

Current political climate: As of now, there are no widely reported plans or discussions about holding such a referendum in Illinois. Major healthcare funding changes typically involve extensive public debate and legislative processes before reaching the referendum stage. 3. Historical precedent: Illinois does not have a recent history of frequent referendums on healthcare funding. Such significant changes are more often handled through legislative processes. 4. Complexity of healthcare funding: Healthcare funding is a complex issue that often requires extensive study and debate before being put to a public vote. The short timeframe makes it less likely that such a complex issue would be ready for a referendum. 5. Legislative priorities: Without any current indications of this being a priority for Illinois lawmakers, it seems unlikely that they would fast-track such a significant issue to referendum in less than a year. 6. Referendum process: In Illinois, to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot, it needs to be approved by a three-fifths majority in both houses of the General Assembly. This process alone can be time-consuming and challenging to achieve within the given timeframe. 7. COVID-19 aftermath: While the pandemic has highlighted healthcare issues, it has also strained state budgets and may have shifted priorities away from major structural changes in healthcare funding. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Illinois will hold a referendum on healthcare funding by July 2024.

(a) New York City announcing plans to restrict short-term rental units: New York City has been grappling with the impact of short-term rentals on its housing market for years. In 2022, the city implemented new registration requirements for short-term rentals, indicating a trend towards tighter regulation. Given the ongoing concerns about housing affordability and the impact of short-term rentals on local communities, it's quite plausible that NYC might announce further restrictions by July 2024.

(b) The median Canadian home price reaching a new record high: Canadian home prices have been volatile in recent years, with significant increases followed by corrections.

Potential interest rate cuts if inflation stabilizes 2. Continued housing supply shortages in major urban areas 3. Strong immigration driving housing demand 4. Potential economic recovery. On the other hand, high interest rates could persist, and economic uncertainties might keep prices subdued.

Historical context: Airline mechanic strikes in the US are relatively rare. The last major strike was in 2005 when Northwest Airlines mechanics went on strike for 14 months. However, this was an exceptional case. 3. Duration: The question asks about a strike lasting until at least August 31, 2024. Given that the question is created on June 30, 2024, this would mean a strike lasting at least two months. While not impossible, strikes of this length are uncommon in the airline industry due to the significant economic impact on both workers and companies. 4. Legal framework: In the US, airline strikes are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which includes a complex process of mediation and cooling-off periods before a strike can legally occur. This process often leads to resolutions before a strike happens. 5. Economic pressures: Both airlines and mechanics have strong incentives to avoid or quickly resolve strikes. Airlines face massive financial losses during strikes, while mechanics risk losing wages and potentially their jobs. 6. Current industry climate: The airline industry has been recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, and there's generally been a push for stability. This might make both sides more inclined to negotiate rather than engage in prolonged strikes. 7. Resolution criteria: The question requires full resumption of normal operations by August 31, 2024, for a NO resolution.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that a major, prolonged strike of airline mechanics will occur and persist through August 2024.

A 0.5% monthly increase is significant but not unprecedented for Russia.

A large donation to historically Black education schools would align with their educational focus. 5. Economic factors: The state of the economy and Bloomberg's personal wealth could influence the likelihood of such a large donation. As of 2023, Bloomberg's net worth remains substantial, making such a donation feasible. 6. Social context: There's ongoing national attention on supporting historically Black institutions and addressing racial inequities in education, which could motivate such a donation. 7. Specificity of the question: The question is very specific about the amount ($600 million) and the purpose (endowments), which narrows the probability. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of this event occurring. Bloomberg Philanthropies has shown interest in supporting historically Black institutions and education, and they have the financial capacity to make such a donation. However, the specific amount and purpose make it less likely than a more general donation to these institutions."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "ecb6c629-3cf5-4477-b3a7-b4a34e3defe7", "title": "Will the Bank of England announce an interest rate cut by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if the Bank of England officially announces an interest rate cut to take effect by August 31, 2024.

The Bank Rate currently stands at 5%, the highest level since 2008. 2. Inflation outlook: The Bank of England's primary mandate is to maintain price stability, targeting a 2% inflation rate. If inflation shows signs of decreasing towards this target by early 2024, it could pave the way for rate cuts. 3. Economic growth: The UK economy has been struggling with slow growth. If economic conditions worsen or stagnate, this could pressure the BoE to cut rates to stimulate growth. 4. Global economic factors: Global economic conditions, including actions by other major central banks like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, can influence the BoE's decisions. 5. Time frame: The question asks about a cut announcement by August 2024, which is over a year away from the current date. This provides a significant time window for economic conditions to change. 6. Historical precedent: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates after a tightening cycle unless there's a significant economic downturn or rapid disinflation. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The extended time frame increases the likelihood, as it allows for potential improvements in inflation and possible economic challenges that might necessitate monetary easing.

In 2020, Bloomberg Philanthropies donated $100 million to four historically Black medical schools. However, a $600 million donation would be exceptionally large, even for Bloomberg. The specific amount and target (endowments of historically Black education schools) make this a very precise prediction.

(a) Tesla announcing additional layoffs beyond the initially reported 6% by August 2024: Tesla has already announced a 6% workforce reduction, which is significant. The likelihood of additional layoffs depends on several factors: 1. Economic conditions: If the global economy faces a downturn or the EV market becomes more competitive, Tesla might need to cut costs further. 2. Tesla's financial performance: If Tesla's profits decline or if they face unexpected challenges, they might resort to more layoffs. 3. Technological advancements: If Tesla implements more automation or AI in their processes, it could lead to additional job cuts. However, announcing further layoffs so soon after a significant cut could damage employee morale and public perception. Tesla is also in a growth phase in many areas, which might counterbalance the need for additional cuts. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of Tesla announcing additional layoffs beyond the initial 6% by August 2024 to be around 30%.

Economic factors: Despite economic sanctions, Russia has continued to invest in its nuclear sector. However, the ongoing war in Ukraine and related economic pressures might affect the country's ability to finance new large-scale projects. 3. Global energy trends: There's a growing global interest in nuclear energy as a low-carbon power source, which could encourage Russia to expand its nuclear capabilities to maintain its position as a major energy exporter. 4. Existing plans: The question mentions two currently planned reactors. This suggests that Russia is already committed to nuclear expansion, making additional announcements more likely. 5. Timeframe: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is about a year from now. This gives Russia a reasonable amount of time to develop and announce new plans. 6.

Successful winter crop season for wheat and barley: Russia is one of the world's largest wheat exporters and has a significant agricultural sector. However, crop yields can be affected by various factors such as weather conditions, pests, and geopolitical situations. The requirement for yields to be at least 5% above the five-year average is quite stringent. While Russia has had good harvests in recent years, consistently exceeding the average by such a margin is challenging. Additionally, climate change and potential geopolitical tensions could impact agricultural output. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 40%. 2. Announcement of plans to build additional nuclear reactors: Russia has been actively pursuing nuclear energy development and has plans to increase its nuclear capacity. The country has a strong nuclear industry and sees nuclear power as a key component of its energy strategy. However, building nuclear reactors is a significant undertaking that requires substantial financial investment and long-term planning. The current global economic situation and potential sanctions could affect Russia's ability to finance such projects. Nevertheless, Russia has shown a commitment to nuclear energy, and announcing plans (not necessarily starting construction) is relatively feasible. I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 60%. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.40 * 0.60 = 0.24 or 24%.

Recent legislation: In August 2022, Indiana passed a near-total abortion ban, which was later blocked by the courts. This suggests that the current political leadership is not in favor of enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a referendum by July 2024, which is only about a year away from the current date. Organizing a statewide referendum on such a contentious issue typically requires significant time for planning, legislative approval, and public debate. 4. Lack of current initiatives: As of now, there are no widely reported initiatives or movements in Indiana pushing for a referendum on abortion rights. Such a significant political move would likely have some visible momentum by this point if it were to occur within a year. 5. National context: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, these have primarily been in more liberal-leaning states or in response to restrictive laws. Indiana's political climate makes it less likely to follow this trend. 6. Constitutional amendment process: In Indiana, amending the state constitution requires approval from two consecutive sessions of the General Assembly before going to a public vote. This process typically takes several years, making it highly unlikely to be completed by July 2024 if it hasn't already started. 7. Public opinion: While public opinion on abortion in Indiana may be mixed, there's no strong evidence of overwhelming public pressure for a referendum on enshrining abortion rights. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Indiana will hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024.

Public opinion: While public opinion in Texas on abortion is more divided than the state's laws might suggest, it's unclear if there's enough public pressure to force a referendum on this issue. 8. Legislative calendar: The Texas Legislature meets in odd-numbered years, meaning the next regular session won't be until 2025, after the deadline for this question. A special session would be required to initiate a referendum before August 2024. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Texas will hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024.

In January 2024, they already announced layoffs of around 12,000 employees. Given the ongoing AI revolution and Google's commitment to staying competitive in this field, it's quite plausible that they might conduct another round of layoffs specifically tied to AI reorganization. However, the specific number of 1,800 employees is quite precise, which makes it less certain. Google might choose a different number or implement layoffs in stages. Still, given their history and the industry trends, there's a moderate to high chance of this occurring. b) South African Reserve Bank (SARB) interest rate cut: The SARB's decisions on interest rates depend on various economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic conditions. As of early 2024, South Africa has been maintaining relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. However, if inflation shows signs of easing and economic growth remains sluggish, there could be pressure to cut rates to stimulate the economy. The timeframe until July 2024 provides several opportunities for the SARB to make such a decision. However, given the unpredictability of economic conditions and the conservative nature of central banks, this is far from certain. Combining these events: For both events to occur, we need them to happen independently. The Google layoffs are more likely than not, while the SARB rate cut is less certain. The combination of these two events occurring together by July 2024 is therefore less likely than either event happening individually.

This is a relatively short period for implementing significant policy changes, especially for a large company like Facebook. 2. Antitrust concerns: The question mentions antitrust concerns, which suggests that there has likely been an ongoing legal battle or investigation into Facebook's advertising practices. Antitrust cases against tech giants have been increasingly common in recent years. 3. Facebook's history: Facebook (now Meta) has a history of facing regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges. They have made changes to their policies in the past in response to legal pressures, but they also tend to fight legal battles vigorously. 4. Implementation confirmation: The question requires confirmation from official announcements, court documents, or major news outlets. This adds a layer of verification that makes it more likely we would know if changes were implemented. 5. Scope of changes: The question allows for a wide range of potential changes, including modifications in ad targeting, pricing models, or advertiser agreements. This broad definition increases the likelihood of some change being implemented. 6. Appeals and stay orders: The question explicitly states that appeals or stay orders that might delay implementation are not considered. This removes a potential obstacle to implementation within the timeframe. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high probability that Facebook will implement some court-ordered changes to its advertising policies by August 2024. The short timeframe is a concern, but the broad definition of what constitutes a change and Facebook's history of responding to legal pressures suggest that some form of implementation is likely.

Political will: There's no current indication that New York's government is actively pursuing such a referendum. Usually, these initiatives are discussed well in advance. 5. National context: While the overturning of Roe v. Wade has led to increased focus on abortion rights nationwide, states like New York that already have strong protections may not feel the same pressure to act as more conservative states. 6. Precedent: New York doesn't frequently use referendums for policy decisions, preferring to act through the legislature. 7. Alternative actions: Instead of a referendum, New York might choose to further strengthen abortion rights through legislative action, which is typically a quicker and more straightforward process. 8. Public opinion: While there's strong support for abortion rights in New York, there's no evident public demand for a referendum on this issue. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that New York will conduct a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. While it's not impossible, there's no current indication of plans for such a referendum, and the existing legal protections reduce the urgency for such an action. The short timeframe also makes it less likely."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e72c094a-f9d3-4f0a-93fd-012d89315257", "title": "Will New Jersey hold a referendum on affordable housing by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, New Jersey holds a referendum on enshrining affordable housing in its state constitution.

There's no indication that such a proposal is currently being seriously considered or debated in the state legislature. 4. Historical precedent: New Jersey has not frequently held referendums on constitutional amendments related to housing issues. The state has addressed affordable housing primarily through legislation and court decisions, most notably the Mount Laurel doctrine. 5.

This shows the company is not averse to significant layoffs when deemed necessary. AI-focused reorganization: Zoom has explicitly announced an AI-focused reorganization plan. This suggests a shift in the company's strategy, which often leads to restructuring and potential job cuts. Industry trends: Many tech companies have been conducting layoffs in recent years, often citing the need to streamline operations and focus on emerging technologies like AI. Time frame: The question gives a relatively long time frame (until July 2024), which provides ample time for the company to implement its reorganization plan. Economic factors: The tech industry has been facing challenges, including economic uncertainties and a post-pandemic slowdown in growth for some remote work tools. Zoom's financial performance: While Zoom experienced explosive growth during the pandemic, its growth has slowed since then. This might pressure the company to reduce costs and improve efficiency. AI integration: As Zoom focuses more on AI, it may need fewer employees in certain roles that can be automated or enhanced by AI technologies. However, there are also factors that might reduce the likelihood of such large layoffs: Previous layoffs: Having already conducted significant layoffs in 2023, Zoom might be hesitant to implement another large round of cuts so soon. Skill retention: As Zoom shifts towards AI, it may want to retain skilled employees who can contribute to this new focus. Public perception: Large layoffs can negatively impact a company's public image and employee morale. Specific number: The question specifies at least 1,800 employees, which is a large and specific number. It's possible Zoom might implement smaller or more gradual cuts that don't reach this threshold. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability that Zoom will lay off at least 1,800 employees by July 2024 as part of its AI-focused reorganization. The company has shown willingness to make large cuts, is undergoing a significant strategic shift, and has ample time to implement changes.

This shows the company is not averse to significant layoffs when deemed necessary. AI-focused reorganization: The question specifically mentions an AI-focused reorganization plan announced in 2023. This suggests that PayPal is actively working on integrating AI into its operations, which could potentially lead to job redundancies in certain areas. Industry trends: Many tech companies have been implementing AI solutions and subsequently reducing their workforce. This broader trend increases the likelihood of PayPal following suit. Economic factors: The global economic situation, including inflation and potential recession fears, might push companies to streamline operations and reduce costs. Time frame: The question gives a relatively short time frame (about a month from the creation date to the resolution date). This tight timeline might make it less likely for PayPal to implement and announce such a significant layoff. Specific number: The threshold of 1,800 employees is quite specific and high. While PayPal has made larger cuts before, reaching this exact number or higher in such a short time frame might be challenging. Public relations: Large-scale layoffs can negatively impact a company's public image. PayPal might be cautious about announcing another significant round of layoffs so soon after the 2023 cuts.

If global economic conditions improve and other central banks start easing their monetary policies, it could create room for Mexico to follow suit. 4.

This is a relatively short time frame for a significant policy shift, especially if current inflationary pressures persist. 5. Central Bank's stance: The Bank of Mexico has been cautious and has maintained a hawkish stance to combat inflation. A shift to rate cuts would require clear evidence of inflation control and economic stability. 6.

(a) Louisiana's near-total abortion ban being declared constitutional: Louisiana has a history of passing strict abortion laws, and the current political climate in the state is generally conservative and anti-abortion. However, declaring such a ban constitutional faces several challenges: 1. Federal precedents: Despite the overturning of Roe v. Wade, there are still federal protections for abortion in certain circumstances. 2. Legal challenges: Abortion rights groups are likely to mount strong legal challenges, which could delay a final decision. 3. Time frame: The legal process can be lengthy, and having a final decision by August 2024 might be tight. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring by August 2024 at around 0.6. (b) Missouri conducting a referendum on abortion rights: Missouri is also a conservative state with strict abortion laws. However, there are several factors to consider: 1. Citizen-led initiatives: There's a growing trend of citizen-led initiatives to protect abortion rights, even in conservative states. 2. Political response: The state government might preemptively act to prevent such a referendum. 3. Time frame: Organizing a referendum takes time, but the August 2024 deadline provides a reasonable window. 4. Public opinion: Even in conservative states, there's often more support for abortion rights than politicians assume. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring by August 2024 at around 0.4. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent. If one state takes a strong stance on abortion (either for or against), it might influence actions in other states. This could slightly increase the probability of both events occurring. Taking this into account, I would slightly adjust the final probability upward."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.022193959232431698, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.007397986410810566, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.21029989116983452, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities. Even taking the higher estimates for both events (15% and 10%), the combined probability would be 0.15 * 0.10 = 0.015 or 1.5%.

Political landscape in Nigeria: President Bola Tinubu was elected in 2023, and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), holds a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. This suggests that it would be challenging for the Senate to pass a major bill that the President explicitly opposes. 2. Historical precedent: Nigeria's legislative branch has not typically been known for strong opposition to the executive, especially when the same party controls both branches. This further reduces the likelihood of such a scenario. 3. Economic reform priorities: Tinubu came into office with promises of economic reforms. It's unlikely that the Senate would propose and pass a major economic reform bill that goes against the President's agenda, especially so early in his term. 4. Time frame: The resolution date is August 31, 2024, which is about 14 months from the question's creation date. This is a relatively short period for drafting, debating, and passing a major economic reform bill, especially one that would face presidential opposition. 5.

This adds another layer of complexity, as it requires not just the passage of the bill but also significant international attention. 6. Definition of \"major\" or \"significant\": The requirement for the bill to be described as such by news sources adds another hurdle, as it needs to have a substantial potential impact on the Nigerian economy. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Nigeria's Senate would pass a major economic reform bill opposed by President Tinubu by August 2024.

(a) TikTok's AI-driven content recommendations spreading election misinformation: TikTok has been under scrutiny for its content moderation practices and potential for spreading misinformation. With the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaching, it's likely that social media platforms will face increased scrutiny. TikTok's AI-driven recommendation system is particularly powerful and has been criticized for potentially creating echo chambers and spreading misinformation. However, TikTok has been working on improving its content moderation and has pledged to combat misinformation. The company is aware of the potential issues and may take proactive measures to prevent widespread election misinformation. Still, given the complexity of AI systems and the challenges of moderating a vast amount of user-generated content, it's quite possible that some election misinformation will slip through. The likelihood of credible reports from multiple sources specifically mentioning TikTok's AI role in spreading election misinformation is moderate to high, given the platform's prominence and the focus on social media's impact on elections. (b) Cancellation of the Chinese battery company's factory project in Michigan: The $2.36 billion factory project in Big Rapids, Michigan, by a Chinese lithium-ion battery company is a significant investment. Such large-scale projects often face various challenges, including regulatory hurdles, local opposition, or changes in economic conditions. There has been growing scrutiny of Chinese investments in the U.S., particularly in sensitive sectors like technology and energy. The battery industry is strategically important, and there might be national security concerns that could lead to increased scrutiny or potential cancellation. However, the project has likely already gone through initial approvals and may have support from local and state governments due to its potential for job creation and economic benefits. Cancelling such a large project would be a significant decision with economic and political ramifications. The likelihood of this project being completely cancelled by August 2024 is lower than the likelihood of the TikTok misinformation reports, but it's not negligible. Combining these factors: While it's quite possible that TikTok will face credible reports about election misinformation (let's estimate this at around 60-70%), the cancellation of the battery factory project is less likely (perhaps 20-30%).

(a) Colorado's near-total abortion ban being declared constitutional: As of October 2023, Colorado has strong protections for abortion rights. In fact, in April 2022, Colorado passed a law codifying the right to abortion in the state. Given this recent legislative action and the state's generally liberal stance on abortion rights, it seems highly unlikely that a near-total abortion ban would be implemented, let alone declared constitutional by August 2024. The probability of this occurring is very low. (b) Rhode Island maintaining its red flag law: Rhode Island currently has a red flag law in place, which was enacted in 2018. Red flag laws, also known as Extreme Risk Protection Order laws, allow for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. Given that this law is already in place and there's no significant movement or political will to repeal it, it's highly likely that Rhode Island will maintain this law through August 2024. The probability of this condition being met is very high. For both conditions to be met, they must occur simultaneously. Given that one condition is very unlikely (Colorado's abortion ban) and the other is very likely (Rhode Island's red flag law), the overall probability of both occurring is primarily limited by the unlikely event.

This means rates would need to drop by about 0.75 percentage points to fall below 5.0%. 2. Federal Reserve policy: The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation. However, there are indications that the Fed might slow or pause rate hikes in the near future. If inflation continues to cool, the Fed might even consider rate cuts by 2024. 3.

Time frame: We have about 14 months from the question's creation date to the resolution date, which provides a reasonable window for rate changes to occur. 6. Market expectations: Many economists and market analysts are predicting that mortgage rates could decrease in 2024, assuming inflation continues to moderate and economic growth slows. Given these factors, there's a significant chance that mortgage rates could decrease by August 2024. The Federal Reserve's potential shift towards a more dovish stance, combined with possible economic slowdown, could drive rates lower. However, the requirement for rates to fall below 5.0% (not just to 5.0%) adds a degree of difficulty. While it's certainly possible for rates to drop below 5.0%, it would require a substantial decrease from current levels. This is not impossible, especially given the volatile nature of financial markets and the potential for economic changes, but it's not a certainty either.

Prevalence of AI systems in social media platforms: Major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are increasingly using AI systems for content moderation, recommendation algorithms, and targeted advertising. This increased use of AI makes it more likely that these systems could be involved in spreading misinformation. 2. Historical precedent: Social media platforms have been criticized for spreading election misinformation in previous elections, particularly during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections. While these instances were not specifically tied to AI systems, it shows that these platforms are vulnerable to such issues. 3. Increased scrutiny: Given the past issues with election misinformation on social media, there is likely to be heightened scrutiny of these platforms during the 2024 election cycle. This increased attention could lead to more reports and investigations into potential misinformation spread. 4. Complexity of AI systems: AI systems, particularly large language models and recommendation algorithms, can be complex and sometimes produce unexpected results. This complexity increases the chance of unintended consequences, including the spread of misinformation. 5. Rapid AI advancements: The field of AI is advancing rapidly, and social media platforms are likely to implement new AI features in the lead-up to the 2024 election.

This specificity might make it less likely for reports to meet the exact criteria. Considering these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of such reports emerging. The increased use of AI in social media, combined with the historical precedent of misinformation issues and the heightened scrutiny during election periods, makes it quite possible that AI systems will be implicated in spreading election misinformation.

This strong growth might reduce the need for monetary stimulus through rate cuts. 2. Inflation trends: The RBI's primary mandate is to maintain price stability. As of early 2024, India's inflation has been moderating but still remains above the RBI's target range of 2-6%. If inflation continues to ease, it could create room for a rate cut. 3. Global economic factors: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, can influence the RBI's decisions. If global growth slows significantly, it might prompt the RBI to consider a rate cut to support domestic growth. 4. Monetary policy stance: The RBI has maintained a relatively hawkish stance in recent times to combat inflation. A shift towards a more dovish stance would be necessary before considering rate cuts. 5. Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut by July 2024, which gives the RBI about a month to make this decision from the creation date of the question. This is a relatively short time frame for a significant policy shift, especially if there haven't been clear indications of such a move in the lead-up to this period. 6. Recent policy decisions: Without more recent information, it's difficult to gauge the RBI's latest stance. However, central banks typically telegraph their intentions in advance, and a sudden rate cut without prior indication would be unusual. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the RBI would announce a rate cut by July 2024. The strong economic growth reduces the need for stimulus, and unless there's a significant change in inflation trends or global economic conditions, the RBI is more likely to maintain its current stance or even consider rate hikes if inflationary pressures persist. However, economic conditions can change rapidly, and there's always a possibility of unexpected developments that could prompt a rate cut.

This might mean less immediate pressure on Oracle to address AI-specific energy consumption. 3. Oracle's sustainability efforts: Oracle has shown commitment to sustainability in general. They have goals to power their global operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. However, these are broad goals not specifically focused on AI. 4. Timeframe: The question gives only about a month from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a very short timeframe for a large corporation to develop, approve, and announce specific measures targeting AI energy consumption. 5. Oracle's typical approach: Oracle tends to focus more on overall efficiency and performance of their systems rather than making specific announcements about energy consumption for particular technologies. 6. Competitive landscape: If other major tech companies announce similar measures, Oracle might feel pressure to follow suit. However, as of now, such announcements are not widespread in the industry. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Oracle will make such a specific announcement in this short timeframe. While they are likely working on overall energy efficiency, a targeted announcement about AI-related electricity consumption doesn't align well with their typical approach or their current position in the AI market. The extremely short timeframe also makes it less likely for such a specific initiative to be developed and announced."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "0dc58919-7c04-4103-ab41-d8e82107b2e6", "title": "Will both of the following occur by July 2024: (a) The Reserve Bank of India announces an interest rate cut, and (b) Oracle announces measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following occur by July 31, 2024: (a) The Reserve Bank of India officially announces a decrease in its repo rate, confirmed through official statements or reported by at least two major financial news sources.

(a) Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announcing an interest rate cut: The RBI's monetary policy decisions are influenced by various economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic conditions. As of now (June 2023), the RBI has been maintaining a relatively hawkish stance due to inflationary pressures. However, by July 2024, which is more than a year away, the economic landscape could change significantly. If inflation moderates and economic growth needs a boost, the RBI might consider cutting rates. However, given the current stance and the uncertainty of future economic conditions, a rate cut is possible but not highly probable. (b) Oracle announcing measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption: The tech industry, including major players like Oracle, is increasingly under pressure to address the environmental impact of their operations, particularly in relation to AI. As AI becomes more prevalent and energy-intensive, companies are likely to face both regulatory and public pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Oracle, as a significant player in the cloud and AI space, has a vested interest in improving its energy efficiency. By July 2024, it's quite plausible that Oracle would announce such measures, especially given the growing focus on environmental sustainability in the tech sector. Combining these events: For both events to occur, we need both the RBI to cut rates and Oracle to announce energy-saving measures. While the Oracle announcement seems more likely, the RBI rate cut is less certain. The probability of both events occurring is limited by the lower probability event (the RBI rate cut in this case). Given these considerations, I would estimate a moderate to low probability of both events occurring by July 2024."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.07212806766864044, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.024042689222880147, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3352007615769954, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Public support for abortion rights has generally increased in recent years, which could influence court decisions and legislative actions. Unless there are unexpected changes in the composition of either state's Supreme Court, the justices who made the 2023 decisions are likely to maintain consistent views. Courts generally respect their own recent precedents unless there's a compelling reason to overturn them. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that both Virginia and Florida will maintain their current legal stances on abortion access by July 2024. The recent nature of the decisions, the relatively short time frame, and the tendency of courts to respect their own precedents all support this conclusion. However, the contentious nature of the abortion issue and the potential for political pressure or new legislation introduce some uncertainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Seasonal patterns: While the question asks for seasonally adjusted rates, it's worth noting that summer months (June and July) are typically strong for home sales. A decline during this period could be more significant. 5. Housing supply and demand: Imbalances in housing supply and demand can affect sales. A shortage of affordable homes or oversupply in certain areas could lead to sales declines. 6.

Then it must pass by a two-thirds majority in the next legislative session. Only then can it be put to a public referendum. This multi-step process makes it extremely unlikely to occur within such a short timeframe. 5. Historical precedent: Tennessee has not shown a tendency to hold referendums on healthcare funding in the past, and there's no indication of a sudden shift in this direction. 6. Current healthcare policies: Tennessee has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which suggests a reluctance to increase state involvement in healthcare funding. This makes a constitutional referendum on the matter less likely.

Recent legislative actions: In January 2023, Minnesota passed the PRO Act, which codified abortion rights into state law. This suggests that there is already strong support for abortion rights in the state government. 3. Constitutional amendments in Minnesota: To amend the state constitution, which would be necessary to enshrine abortion rights at the highest level, both chambers of the legislature must pass the proposed amendment, and then it must be approved by voters in a general election. 4.

Another U.S. state adopting a Medicaid plan with a health savings account requirement by July 2024: - Currently, only Georgia has implemented such a plan. - Health savings account requirements in Medicaid are controversial and not widely adopted. - The deadline (July 2024) is quite soon, giving states limited time to develop, approve, and implement such a plan. - However, some states might be interested in following Georgia's model, especially those with more conservative leadership. Given these factors, both events occurring within the specified timeframes seems unlikely. The Illinois referendum is particularly improbable, while the Medicaid plan adoption in another state has a slightly higher, but still low, likelihood."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.006999833909463238, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0023332779698210793, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.11496024978590212, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Precedents: Other major European cities like Barcelona, Amsterdam, and Paris have already implemented restrictions on short-term rentals. This trend suggests that Rome might follow suit. 3. Housing pressure: Rome, like many other major cities, faces housing affordability issues. Short-term rentals can exacerbate this problem by reducing the availability of long-term housing for residents. 4. Tourism management: Rome has been dealing with overtourism issues, and regulating short-term rentals could be seen as a way to manage tourist numbers and their impact on the city. 5. Political climate: The current administration's stance on tourism and housing would play a crucial role. However, without specific information about Rome's current government and their policies, it's difficult to gauge their likelihood of taking such action. 6. Timeframe: The question gives a relatively short timeframe (about a month) for this announcement to be made. This could reduce the likelihood, as policy changes often take time to develop and announce. 7.

Given these factors, it seems that there are valid reasons for Rome to consider such restrictions.

Current economic conditions: The Eurozone is currently facing high inflation rates, which have been the primary reason for the ECB's recent interest rate hikes. As of early 2024, inflation remains above the ECB's 2% target. 2. ECB's monetary policy stance: The ECB has been maintaining a hawkish stance to combat inflation. They have consistently communicated their commitment to bringing inflation down to their target level. 3. Economic projections: Many economists expect inflation to gradually decrease throughout 2024, but it's uncertain whether it will reach the ECB's target by July. 4. Global economic factors: Geopolitical tensions, energy prices, and global economic growth can influence the ECB's decision-making process. 5. Time frame: The question asks about a cut by July 2024, which gives the ECB about 7 months from the current date to make this decision. This is a relatively short time frame for a significant policy shift. 6. Historical precedent: The ECB tends to move cautiously and often signals policy changes well in advance. A sudden rate cut without prior indication would be unusual. 7. Forward guidance: As of early 2024, the ECB has not provided any strong indications of an imminent rate cut. They typically use forward guidance to prepare markets for policy changes. 8. Economic recovery: The pace of economic recovery in the Eurozone will play a crucial role. If growth stagnates significantly, it might increase the pressure for a rate cut. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the ECB will announce an interest rate cut by July 2024. The ECB is more likely to wait for clear evidence that inflation is sustainably approaching their target before considering rate cuts. They would also likely signal such a move well in advance. However, there is always a possibility of unexpected economic shocks or a faster-than-anticipated decline in inflation that could prompt earlier action. Additionally, if economic growth in the Eurozone deteriorates significantly, it could increase the pressure for monetary easing.

This suggests that the current government is unlikely to initiate a referendum to enshrine abortion rights. 2. Time frame: The resolution date is August 31, 2024, which is about 14 months from now. This is a relatively short period to organize a state-wide referendum, especially on such a contentious issue. 3. Ballot initiative process: Florida does allow citizen-initiated constitutional amendments, but the process is complex and time-consuming. It requires gathering signatures from 8% of the total number of votes cast in the last presidential election, spread across at least half of the state's congressional districts. This would need to be completed well before August 2024 to allow time for verification and inclusion on the ballot. 4. Recent abortion legislation: In April 2023, Florida passed a law banning most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. This indicates that the current political establishment is not inclined towards protecting abortion rights. 5. Public opinion: While there might be public support for abortion rights, organizing and funding a successful ballot initiative in such a short time frame would be challenging. 6. Precedent: Other states like Michigan have successfully held referendums on abortion rights, which could inspire similar efforts in Florida. However, the political landscape in Florida is quite different. 7. Potential legal challenges: Even if a ballot initiative were to gain traction, it would likely face legal challenges from anti-abortion groups, potentially delaying the process. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for a referendum to occur, it seems highly unlikely within the given timeframe.

The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for organizing a state-wide referendum, especially on such a contentious issue. 4.

Political climate: Indiana is a predominantly conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature and governor. This political environment is generally more favorable to strict abortion laws. 3. Legal precedent: The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 (Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization) has given states more leeway to restrict abortion rights. This could potentially work in favor of Indiana's ban being upheld. 4. Time frame: The question allows for almost 10 months from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a relatively short period for a case to move through the court system, especially if it faces multiple appeals. 5. State constitution: The constitutionality will be determined based on the Indiana state constitution, not the U.S. Constitution. State constitutions can sometimes provide broader protections than the federal constitution. 6. Recent trends: Several states have seen their abortion bans blocked or overturned by state courts, even in conservative states. This suggests that state constitutions may provide stronger protections for abortion rights than anticipated. 7. Public opinion: While not directly influencing court decisions, public opinion can play a role in how aggressively laws are defended or challenged. Abortion remains a divisive issue in many states. Given these factors, I believe there's a significant chance that the ban will not be declared constitutional by August 2024. The main reasons for this assessment are: - The short time frame, which may not allow for a final decision to be reached. - The trend of state courts finding similar bans unconstitutional under state constitutions. - The complexity of the legal issues involved, which may lead to prolonged legal battles.

Government policies: The South Korean government has been implementing various measures to stimulate the economy, including fiscal spending and monetary policies. These efforts are likely to continue to support economic growth. 4. Global economic conditions: The global economic outlook for 2023-2024 remains uncertain, with concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential slowdowns in major economies like the US and China. However, the IMF and other international organizations have generally maintained positive growth forecasts for South Korea. 5. Resilience of the Korean economy: South Korea has demonstrated its ability to navigate economic challenges in the past, showing adaptability and innovation in its industrial sectors. 6. Time frame: The question covers a period from October 2023 to July 2024, which is relatively short. This reduces the likelihood of experiencing two consecutive quarters of negative growth within this specific timeframe. 7. Historical context: South Korea has not experienced a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth) since the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, demonstrating the economy's overall stability. Given these factors, it appears more likely than not that South Korea will avoid a recession by July 2024. The country's economic fundamentals, government support, and the recovering global demand for its key exports all contribute to a positive outlook. However, there are still risks, particularly from external factors like global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e1be7ebf-f9ac-49f6-9f46-e52b40b501b3", "title": "Will the WHO declare the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria no longer a global emergency by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declares that the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria is no longer considered a global emergency.

(a) South Korean economy avoiding recession by July 2024: South Korea has a robust and diversified economy, which has shown resilience in the face of global economic challenges. However, it's also exposed to global economic trends and geopolitical tensions. As of mid-2023, South Korea's economy has been growing, albeit at a slower pace. The Bank of Korea and the government have been implementing measures to support economic growth. Given these factors and the historical performance of the South Korean economy, it seems more likely than not that it will avoid a recession.

(b) WHO declaring the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria no longer a global emergency by August 2024: Lassa fever is endemic in parts of West Africa, including Nigeria, and outbreaks occur regularly. However, it's important to note that as of mid-2023, the WHO has not declared the Lassa fever situation in Nigeria a global emergency. The question assumes this declaration will happen and then be lifted. This assumption complicates the probability assessment. Lassa fever outbreaks are typically seasonal and can be controlled with proper measures. However, declaring an end to a global emergency requires significant improvement in the situation and confidence that it won't immediately worsen again. Given that the WHO hasn't declared it a global emergency yet, and considering the time frame (by August 2024), it seems unlikely that they would both declare it an emergency and then lift that declaration within this period.

Nature of bird flu outbreaks: Avian influenza outbreaks can be persistent and challenging to control, often lasting for extended periods. 4. Global spread: Bird flu outbreaks can affect multiple countries and continents, making it more difficult to declare a global end to the outbreak. 5.

(a) Singapore Straits Times Index reaching or exceeding 4,000 points: As of June 2023, the Singapore Straits Times Index (STI) is trading around 3,200 points. To reach 4,000 points by August 2024, it would need to increase by approximately 25%. This is a significant jump, but not impossible given the right economic conditions. However, global economic uncertainties, including potential recessions in major economies, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, may hinder such growth. The STI has never reached 4,000 points in its history, with its all-time high being around 3,900 in 2007.

(b) WHO declaring the current bird flu outbreak over: The current bird flu outbreak has been ongoing since 2021, with significant impacts on poultry populations and some human cases. The WHO typically declares an outbreak over when there have been no new cases for a certain period, usually twice the incubation period of the disease. For avian influenza, this could be around 28 days. Given that the outbreak is still active as of mid-2023, and considering the time it takes for cases to subside and for the WHO to make an official declaration, there's a moderate chance this could happen by August 2024. However, the unpredictable nature of viral outbreaks and the potential for new strains to emerge make this uncertain. I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at about 60%. For both conditions to be met, we need to consider the joint probability. Since these events are largely independent, we can multiply their individual probabilities: 0.30 * 0.60 = 0.18 or 18%.

However, these were primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and financial pressures, not an AI-focused reorganization. 2. AI integration: Uber has been investing heavily in AI technology, which could lead to increased efficiency and potentially reduce the need for certain roles. However, AI integration often requires new skilled positions as well. 3. Current financial status: As of 2023, Uber has been showing improved financial performance, which might reduce the pressure for large-scale layoffs. 4.

The House of Lords generally respects the primacy of the elected House of Commons, especially on economic matters.

Uber layoffs: Uber announced an AI-focused reorganization plan in 2023, which suggests that significant changes are likely. However, laying off 1,800 employees is a substantial number, even for a large company like Uber. The company has a history of layoffs, with 3,700 employees laid off in 2020 due to the pandemic. The timeline (by July 2024) gives Uber about a year to implement these changes, which is a reasonable timeframe for a major reorganization.

Let's break down each condition: a) US airline mechanics remaining on strike: As of now (June 2024), there is no major ongoing strike of US airline mechanics. While labor disputes in the airline industry are not uncommon, a strike lasting more than two months (from now until August 2024) would be quite unusual. Historically, most airline strikes are resolved within a few weeks due to the significant economic impact on both the company and workers. Additionally, the US government often intervenes in prolonged airline strikes due to their impact on the national economy. Without any current strike in progress, the likelihood of this condition being met is low. b) Massachusetts holding a referendum on abortion rights: Massachusetts is generally considered a pro-choice state, and abortion rights are already protected under state law. However, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many states have been taking steps to further enshrine abortion rights in their constitutions. While there have been discussions about such a referendum in Massachusetts, as of June 2024, no concrete plans have been announced for an August 2024 vote. Organizing a statewide referendum typically requires several months of preparation, including gathering signatures, legislative approval, and setting up the voting infrastructure.

Arkansas Senate passing a total abortion ban: - Arkansas already has some of the strictest abortion laws in the United States. - In 2021, Arkansas passed a near-total abortion ban (Act 309), which was later blocked by a federal judge. - Given the existing political climate in Arkansas and previous attempts, there's a higher likelihood of the Senate attempting to pass another strict abortion ban. - However, the definition of 'total abortion ban' in the question allows for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life, which might make it more palatable for passage. - The Republican-majority Arkansas Senate increases the likelihood of such a bill passing if introduced. - Probability of this occurring: Moderate to high, estimated at about 60%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.10 * 0.60 = 0.06 or 6%. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent.

While companies typically work quickly to address recall issues, complex cases involving multiple products can indeed last this long, especially if there are ongoing investigations or if the company faces challenges in implementing corrective measures.

India's inflation has been moderating, with the latest data showing it within the RBI's target range of 2-6%. 3. However, the RBI has maintained a cautious stance, citing potential inflationary pressures from food prices and global uncertainties. 4. The Indian economy has been showing robust growth, which might reduce the urgency for rate cuts. For Chile: 1. The Central Bank of Chile has been on an easing cycle, having cut rates multiple times in recent months. 2. Chile's inflation has been declining, moving closer to the central bank's target range. 3. The Chilean economy has been facing challenges, including slower growth, which could motivate further rate cuts. Global factors: 1. Global economic growth is expected to slow in 2024, which could influence both countries' monetary policies. 2. Major central banks like the US Federal Reserve are expected to start cutting rates in 2024, which could give more room for emerging markets to ease their policies. Given these factors, it seems more likely that Chile will cut rates by July 2024, as they are already in an easing cycle and facing economic challenges. For India, the situation is less clear. While inflation is moderating, the robust economic growth and the RBI's cautious stance make a rate cut less certain. For both countries to cut rates by July 2024, we would need to see: 1.

Recent legislative actions: In January 2023, Minnesota passed the PRO Act, which codified abortion rights into state law. This indicates that there is already strong support for abortion rights in the state government. 3. Constitutional amendments in Minnesota: To amend the state constitution, which would be necessary for a referendum, both chambers of the legislature must pass the proposed amendment by a simple majority. Then, it goes to voters in the next general election. 4. Timeline: The question specifies by August 2024, which is relatively soon. The process of proposing, passing, and organizing a referendum would need to start quickly to meet this deadline. 5. Necessity: Given that abortion rights are already protected by state law, there might be less urgency to enshrine these rights in the constitution through a referendum. 6.

Recent history: In 2023, the Florida Supreme Court struck down state laws that regulated abortion providers more strictly than other healthcare providers and banned a common second-trimester procedure. This decision is relatively recent, suggesting a pro-choice leaning in the court. 2. Time frame: The question asks about the situation by July 31, 2024, which is only about a year from the creation date of this question. This is a relatively short period for significant legal changes to occur, especially in matters as contentious as abortion rights. 3. Political climate: Florida is known to be a swing state with a Republican-leaning government. However, the state Supreme Court's decision in 2023 indicates a more liberal stance on abortion rights than might be expected given the state's political leadership. 4. Potential for new cases: For the court to reverse or significantly alter its 2023 decision, a new case would need to be brought before the court, make its way through the lower courts, and be heard by the Supreme Court. This process typically takes more than a year, making it less likely to occur before July 2024. 5. Public opinion: Abortion rights have been a highly debated topic nationwide, with many states seeing pushback against restrictive laws. This public sentiment could influence the court's willingness to reverse its recent decision. 6. Composition of the court: Unless there are unexpected changes in the composition of the Florida Supreme Court, the same justices who made the 2023 decision are likely to still be serving in 2024. This consistency in court composition reduces the likelihood of a significant shift in stance. 7. Precedent: Courts generally respect their own recent precedents unless there are compelling reasons to overturn them. The 2023 decision is very recent, making it less likely to be overturned in such a short timeframe. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Florida will maintain its current legal stance on abortion access by July 2024.

Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex and time-consuming process, typically requiring legislative approval and significant planning. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a major political event, especially without any current indications of such a plan.

However, court decisions, especially at the Supreme Court level, are not frequently reversed in such a short timeframe unless there's a significant change in circumstances or court composition. The stability of court decisions contributes to legal predictability, which courts generally try to maintain. The probability of this condition being met is higher, perhaps around 70%.

Ongoing conflict: As of June 2024, the war between Russia and Ukraine is still ongoing, and there's no clear indication of it ending soon. This increases the likelihood of continued Russian attacks on Kyiv. 3. Zelenskyy's position: Zelenskyy remains the President of Ukraine and has shown no signs of stepping down. His term is set to end in 2024, but given the wartime situation, elections might be postponed. 4. Zelenskyy's communication style: Throughout the war, Zelenskyy has been very vocal in condemning Russian actions, regularly addressing the public and the international community. 5. Time frame: The question allows for a two-month window (July and August 2024) for such a condemnation to occur, which is a significant amount of time given the frequency of Russian attacks and Zelenskyy's responses. 6. Media coverage: Given the high-profile nature of the conflict and Zelenskyy's statements, any condemnation he makes is likely to be widely reported by international news sources. 7. Flexibility of the criteria: The question allows for condemnation of any Russian aerial attack on Kyiv, not just new ones, which increases the likelihood of a qualifying statement being made. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that Zelenskyy will publicly condemn a Russian aerial attack on Kyiv within the specified timeframe. The ongoing nature of the conflict, Zelenskyy's consistent communication style, and the broad criteria for what qualifies as a condemnation all point towards a high probability of this event occurring. The main risks to this not happening would be if Zelenskyy were to unexpectedly leave office or if there was a sudden and complete cessation of hostilities, both of which seem unlikely given the current situation."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "c4ab8b97-4fa4-4cf5-ae2f-d7d830b8b385", "title": "Will Germany maintain its ban on nuclear power through August, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by August 31, 2024, the government of Germany has not officially reversed its existing ban on nuclear power.

Historical context: Germany has been committed to phasing out nuclear power since 2011, following the Fukushima disaster. The last nuclear power plants were shut down in April 2023, marking the end of the nuclear era in Germany. 2. Political landscape: The current coalition government, led by the Social Democrats (SPD) with the Greens and Free Democrats (FDP), has been supportive of the nuclear phase-out. The Greens, in particular, have been staunchly anti-nuclear. 3. Energy security concerns: The war in Ukraine and subsequent energy crisis led to discussions about extending the life of nuclear plants, but ultimately, the government decided against it, showing their commitment to the ban. 4. Renewable energy progress: Germany has been investing heavily in renewable energy sources. By 2024, these investments are likely to have further reduced dependence on nuclear power. 5. Public opinion: The majority of Germans have been supportive of the nuclear phase-out, although this sentiment has fluctuated with energy security concerns. 6. Time frame: The question asks about maintaining the ban through August 2024, which is only about two months after the question's creation date. This short timeframe makes significant policy reversals less likely. 7. International pressure: While some countries might pressure Germany to reconsider its stance, Germany has shown resilience in maintaining its position. 8. Economic factors: The costs associated with restarting nuclear power plants would be significant, making a quick reversal less likely. Given these factors, it seems highly probable that Germany will maintain its ban on nuclear power through August 2024.

(a) Zelenskyy condemning a Russian aerial attack on Kyiv: The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine makes it highly likely that Russia will continue its military actions against Ukraine, including aerial attacks on Kyiv. Zelenskyy has consistently condemned Russian attacks throughout the conflict, especially those targeting civilian areas in Kyiv. As the president and a strong advocate for Ukraine's sovereignty, Zelenskyy is very likely to continue this pattern of public condemnation. The specified criteria for the condemnation (official capacity, specific reference, public accessibility, and reporting by reputable sources) are consistent with Zelenskyy's past responses to attacks. The timeframe (by August 31, 2024) provides ample opportunity for such an event to occur. However, there's a small chance that Zelenskyy might not be president by that date due to unforeseen circumstances. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of this condition being met at about 0.9. (b) Germany maintaining its ban on nuclear power: Germany officially phased out nuclear power in April 2023, fulfilling a long-term policy goal. The decision to ban nuclear power has broad political support and aligns with Germany's commitment to renewable energy. Reversing this decision would require significant political will and public support, which seems unlikely in the short term. However, energy security concerns, especially in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, could potentially lead to reconsideration of the ban. The relatively short timeframe (until August 2024) makes a complete reversal of the policy less likely, as such changes typically take longer to implement. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of Germany maintaining its ban on nuclear power by August 2024 at about 0.85.

Food safety measures: Reputable companies like Columbus Craft Meats typically have stringent food safety protocols in place to prevent contamination. However, no system is perfect, and occasional issues can occur. 3. Time frame: The question covers a period of about two months (from the creation date to the resolution date).

Listeria's nature: Listeria is a bacteria that can survive and grow at refrigeration temperatures, making it a particular concern for ready-to-eat meats like salami. 5. Regulatory oversight: The food industry is heavily regulated, with frequent inspections and testing. This increases the likelihood of detecting any contamination quickly. 6.

Recent trends: Without specific information about recent food safety trends or issues in the deli meat industry, it's hard to say if there's an increased risk currently. Considering these factors, a listeria-related recall is possible but not highly probable in this short time frame.

However, building new nuclear reactors is a complex, long-term process that requires significant planning, funding, and regulatory approval. The current administration has shown support for nuclear energy, but mainly through maintaining existing plants and developing advanced reactor technologies.

Historically, the defense budget has seen increases more often than cuts, and when cuts occur, they are usually much smaller. Both major political parties generally support maintaining a strong military, making such a significant cut unlikely. The geopolitical situation, including ongoing conflicts and tensions, makes it improbable that lawmakers would agree to such a large reduction in military spending.

By 2021, about 572,000 people were enrolled in the program. This shows that Indiana has experience with Medicaid expansion and has achieved significant enrollment numbers in the past. Recent developments: In April 2023, Indiana passed legislation to further expand Medicaid coverage, removing work requirements and other barriers to enrollment. This change is expected to increase accessibility and potentially boost enrollment numbers. Time frame: The question asks about enrollment by July 2024, which gives approximately one year from the creation date of the question for enrollment to occur. This is a reasonable timeframe for a significant number of people to enroll, especially given the recent policy changes. Population and potential eligibility: Indiana has a population of about 6.8 million people. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that in 2021, about 8% of Indiana's population was uninsured. This suggests there is still a substantial pool of potentially eligible individuals who could benefit from Medicaid expansion. Outreach and awareness: With the recent changes to the program, it's likely that the state will conduct outreach efforts to inform eligible residents about the expanded coverage options, which could drive enrollment. Economic factors: Any economic downturns or job losses could increase the number of people eligible for Medicaid, potentially boosting enrollment. Comparison to other states: Many states that have expanded Medicaid have seen enrollment numbers exceed initial projections, often within the first year of expansion. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that Indiana's Medicaid expansion program could enroll over 200,000 people by July 2024. The recent removal of barriers to enrollment, combined with the state's experience in managing Medicaid expansion and the potential pool of eligible individuals, suggests that reaching this enrollment target is achievable within the given timeframe. However, there are some uncertainties to consider: The exact impact of the recent policy changes is not yet known. The effectiveness of outreach efforts may vary.

WHO declaring COVID-19 outbreak in the Middle East no longer a global emergency by August 2024: The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing since 2020, and while many countries have made significant progress in controlling the virus, the situation remains dynamic. The Middle East has faced various challenges in managing the outbreak, including political instability in some regions and varying healthcare infrastructure. However, by August 2024, it will have been over 4 years since the pandemic began, and global vaccination efforts are likely to have made substantial progress. Additionally, the virus may have become more endemic and less of an acute emergency by that time. Still, the specific requirement for the WHO to declare the Middle East outbreak no longer a global emergency adds uncertainty.

Gun control measures have been a topic of ongoing debate and legislation in various states. The timeframe (by August 2024) gives more than a year for such legislation to be proposed and implemented.

However, as of my last update, it had not yet completed its first uncrewed mission to the ISS. 2. Timeline: The question asks about a crewed mission by August 2024, which is a relatively short timeframe in spacecraft development terms. Typically, multiple uncrewed test flights are conducted before attempting a crewed mission. 3. NASA Contracts: While SNC has contracts with NASA for cargo resupply missions to the ISS using Dream Chaser, I'm not aware of any current contracts for crewed missions. 4. Competition: Other companies like SpaceX and Boeing are already conducting or close to conducting crewed missions to the ISS, which might reduce the urgency for NASA to certify another vehicle for crewed flights. 5. Technical Challenges: Developing a spacecraft capable of safely transporting humans is extremely complex and time-consuming. Any unforeseen technical issues could cause significant delays. 6.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Dream Chaser will complete a crewed return mission from the ISS by August 2024. The spacecraft would need to progress from its current state to being fully certified for human spaceflight in a very short time, which is an extremely challenging task.

In January 2023, the company announced it would cut 10,000 jobs, which was about 5% of its workforce at the time. This shows that Microsoft is not averse to large-scale layoffs when deemed necessary. AI focus: Microsoft has been heavily investing in AI technology, particularly with its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI into its products. This shift in focus could lead to restructuring in other departments. Time frame: The question asks about layoffs by July 2024, which is about a year from the creation date of this question. This provides a significant amount of time for Microsoft to implement changes and make decisions about workforce adjustments. Economic factors: The tech industry has been experiencing some volatility, with many companies implementing cost-cutting measures. If economic conditions worsen, this could increase the likelihood of layoffs. Specificity of the question: The question requires the layoffs to be explicitly linked to the AI-focused reorganization plan announced in 2023. This narrows the scope and makes it somewhat less likely than if it were asking about layoffs in general.

Constitutional amendment process: To hold a referendum on a constitutional amendment in Maryland, it must first pass both houses of the General Assembly with a three-fifths majority before being put to voters. 5. Timeline: The question specifies a deadline of July 31, 2024, which is just over a year away from the current date. 6. National context: Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, several states have moved to protect abortion rights through constitutional amendments. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Maryland will hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024 for the following reasons: a) Maryland already has strong abortion protections in place, reducing the urgency for a constitutional amendment. b) The state has recently taken legislative action to expand abortion access, which may satisfy current demands for stronger protections. c) The process of passing a constitutional amendment through the legislature and then holding a referendum is time-consuming, and the July 2024 deadline is relatively soon. d) There have been no widely reported efforts or announcements from Maryland lawmakers about pursuing a constitutional amendment on abortion rights as of the current date. However, it's not entirely impossible. The national trend of states enshrining abortion rights in their constitutions could influence Maryland to take similar action, even if it's not immediately necessary. Additionally, the Democratic control of the state government could facilitate the process if they decide to pursue it."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "51db1bd7-771b-41cb-9393-f6598c5b5d2e", "title": "Will both of the following occur by July 2024: (a) North Carolina enacts a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth, and (b) Maryland holds a referendum on abortion rights?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following occur by July 31, 2024: (1) The state of North Carolina enacts a new law that modifies or replaces the current restrictions on medical care for transgender youth.

North Carolina enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth: North Carolina has been known for conservative policies regarding LGBTQ+ rights. In 2023, the state enacted restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors. Given the relatively short timeframe (about a year) and the state's political climate, it seems unlikely that North Carolina would reverse or significantly modify these restrictions so soon. However, political landscapes can change, and there might be pressure from advocacy groups or federal level changes that could influence state policy. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring by July 2024 at around 20%. 2. Maryland holding a referendum on abortion rights: Maryland is generally considered a progressive state on reproductive rights. In 2022, voters approved a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights. Given that the state has already taken action to protect abortion rights, there might be less urgency for another referendum. However, with the ongoing national debate on abortion rights, it's possible that Maryland might seek to further strengthen these protections through another referendum. The likelihood of this happening by July 2024 seems moderate, perhaps around 40%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08 or 8%.

They endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020, both well before July of the election year. Given this pattern, it's highly likely they will endorse a candidate by July 2024. The only potential complication would be if there's an unusually contentious primary or if the Democratic nominee isn't clear by then. However, as the incumbent, Joe Biden is likely to be the nominee, making an early endorsement probable. I would estimate the probability of this occurring at about 0.9. (b) Washington referendum on abortion rights: This is less certain. While abortion rights are a significant political issue, especially following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, there's no clear indication that Washington state is planning such a referendum. Washington already has strong abortion protections in place, which might reduce the urgency for a referendum. However, the political climate could change, prompting such action. Without specific information about planned referendums in Washington, this seems less likely.

As of June 2023, the inflation rate was around 4.6%, which is above the central bank's target range of 1-3%. 2. Current interest rate: The Bank of Israel has been maintaining a relatively high interest rate to combat inflation. As of June 2023, the key interest rate was 4.75%. 3. Global economic trends: Many central banks worldwide have been raising interest rates to combat inflation.

Time frame: The question asks about a reduction by August 2024, which gives the central bank more than a year to make this decision. 5. Historical patterns: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates after a tightening cycle unless there's a significant economic downturn or a rapid decrease in inflation. 6. Inflation expectations: If inflation shows signs of consistently decreasing towards the target range, it could prompt the central bank to consider rate cuts. Given these factors, there's a moderate chance that the Bank of Israel might announce a rate cut by August 2024. The extended time frame increases the likelihood, as it allows for potential improvements in inflation and economic conditions. However, the bank will likely be cautious and wait for clear signs that inflation is under control before making such a move.

However, by August 2024, there's a possibility that inflation might have been brought under control, allowing central banks to consider rate cuts to stimulate economic growth. Israel's economy is relatively small and can be sensitive to global economic trends. If global economic conditions improve and inflation eases, there's a reasonable chance that the Central Bank of Israel might reduce rates.

In recent years, the RBI has taken action against several banks, including temporary bans on digital initiatives or restrictions on branch expansion. That being said, HDFC Bank has generally maintained a good reputation and has not faced major regulatory issues recently. For the RBI to impose new curbs specifically on HDFC Bank's lending practices, there would need to be significant concerns or violations identified.

The specific number (1,800) is not unreasonable given past layoff scales. However, the requirement for these layoffs to be explicitly linked to the AI-focused reorganization adds some uncertainty. (b) Central Bank of Mexico interest rate cut: As of June 2023, Mexico's central bank (Banxico) has maintained a high interest rate of 11.25% to combat inflation. While inflation has been showing signs of easing, it remains above the bank's target. The bank has signaled that it might consider rate cuts in the future if inflation continues to decline. Given the timeframe until July 2024 (about a year), there's a reasonable chance that economic conditions could improve enough for Banxico to implement a rate cut. However, this depends on various economic factors and global conditions. Combining these factors: For the question to resolve as YES, both events need to occur. While both are possible, the requirement for both to happen reduces the overall probability. The Microsoft layoffs seem more likely given the company's recent history and ongoing AI focus. The interest rate cut by the Mexican central bank is less certain but still plausible within the given timeframe. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of both events occurring by July 2024 to be moderate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.010050328139721731, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0033501093799072437, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.14199045856176626, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current stance of the Philippine government: The Philippine government has had a complex relationship with Chinese-run online gambling operations, known as Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). While they have been a source of revenue, there have also been concerns about crime, tax evasion, and social issues associated with these operations. 2. Recent trends: In recent years, there has been increasing pressure to regulate or shut down POGOs. In September 2022, the Philippine government announced plans to stop issuing licenses for new POGOs and not renew existing ones upon expiration. 3. Timeframe: The question asks about enforcement by July 2024, which is about a year from now. This provides a relatively short timeframe for such a significant action. 4. Scope of the shutdown: The question requires a shutdown of at least 50% of known Chinese-run online gambling operations, which is a substantial undertaking. 5. Economic considerations: POGOs have been a significant source of revenue for the Philippines, and a complete shutdown could have economic repercussions, which might make the government hesitant. 6. International relations: Such a move could impact Philippines-China relations, which might influence the government's decision. 7. Enforcement capacity: The ability of the Philippine government to effectively enforce such a widespread shutdown within the given timeframe is questionable. 8. Reporting requirements: The question specifies that the enforcement must be reported by at least two reputable international news organizations, which adds another layer of complexity. Given these factors, while there is a clear trend towards stricter regulation of POGOs, a complete and enforced shutdown of at least 50% of operations within a year seems ambitious. The economic implications and potential diplomatic tensions might slow down such a process. Additionally, the requirement for confirmation from international news sources adds another hurdle.

Ongoing investigations: The DOJ has been investigating major tech companies for antitrust issues for several years. In 2020, they filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, and investigations into other tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Facebook (Meta) have been ongoing. 3. Complexity: Antitrust investigations into tech companies are notoriously complex due to the nature of digital markets and the vast scope of these companies' operations. This complexity often leads to prolonged investigations. 4. Political climate: The Biden administration has shown a strong interest in regulating big tech and promoting competition. This could potentially expedite ongoing investigations. 5. Resources: The DOJ has limited resources, and investigating five major tech companies simultaneously would require significant manpower and time. 6. Precedent: Previous major tech antitrust investigations have often taken several years to complete. For example, the Microsoft antitrust case in the late 1990s took about three years from investigation to lawsuit filing. 7. Public pressure: There is increasing public and political pressure to address the market power of big tech companies, which could motivate the DOJ to accelerate its investigations.

Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that the ECB will not announce a rate cut by August 2024. While inflation is expected to decrease, it may not fall quickly enough for the ECB to feel confident in cutting rates by August. Additionally, the ECB will likely want to see sustained evidence of inflation control before easing monetary policy.

As of mid-2023, the ECB has been raising interest rates. For them to announce a rate cut by August 2024, we would need to see a significant improvement in the inflation situation and potentially some economic slowdown that would warrant monetary easing. While it's possible that inflation could come under control by mid-2024, allowing for a rate cut, it's far from certain.

The Biden administration has shown a strong commitment to climate action, but reinstating the Clean Power Plan faces several challenges: 1. Legal hurdles: The Supreme Court's 2022 decision in West Virginia v.

Typical duration of Rift Valley fever outbreaks: Rift Valley fever outbreaks are usually seasonal and often associated with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding. They typically last for a few months rather than years. 3.

Several companies have faced such issues in recent years. 3. Food safety measures: Hormel Foods likely has strict food safety protocols in place to prevent listeria contamination. However, no system is perfect, and contaminations can still occur despite precautions. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 14 months (from now until August 2024), which is a significant amount of time for a potential issue to arise. 5. Regulatory oversight: The FDA and USDA regularly inspect food processing facilities, which could potentially catch a listeria issue before it becomes widespread enough to require a recall. 6. Company size and product range: Hormel Foods is a large company with a wide range of products, which increases the potential for an issue to occur somewhere in their production line. 7. Reporting requirements: Food companies are required to report potential contaminations, which makes it more likely that if an issue is discovered, it will be made public.

In 2022, they recalled about 239,000 vehicles due to seatbelt pretensioners that could explode and injure occupants. This shows they are willing to conduct large recalls when safety issues are identified. Severity of the issue: Seatbelt problems are serious safety concerns that automakers typically address promptly to avoid liability and maintain consumer trust. If the NHTSA has reported an issue with seatbelts not properly securing passengers, this is likely to prompt swift action. Number of vehicles: The threshold of 720,000 vehicles is quite high, suggesting a widespread issue across multiple models or model years. This makes the recall more likely if the problem is confirmed, as it would affect a significant portion of Hyundai's fleet. Timeframe: The question allows for over a year (from June 2023 to August 2024) for Hyundai to initiate the recall. This is a considerable amount of time for investigations to be conducted and for a recall to be organized if necessary. Regulatory pressure: If the NHTSA has identified this issue, they are likely to put pressure on Hyundai to address it, increasing the likelihood of a recall. Hyundai's reputation: As a major automaker, Hyundai has a strong incentive to maintain its reputation for safety. Addressing a known seatbelt issue promptly would be in line with this goal. However, there are also factors that could reduce the likelihood: Potential for a smaller recall: Hyundai might find that the issue affects fewer than 720,000 vehicles, leading to a smaller recall that wouldn't meet the criteria for this question. Alternative solutions: There's a possibility that Hyundai might find a way to address the issue without a full recall, such as a service bulletin or a voluntary repair program. Ongoing investigations: The process of confirming the extent and severity of the issue could take time, potentially pushing the recall beyond the August 2024 deadline. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderately high chance that Hyundai will initiate a recall of over 720,000 vehicles due to this seatbelt issue by August 2024. The severity of seatbelt problems, the potential regulatory pressure, and Hyundai's history of large recalls all point towards this outcome.

In fact, in May 2022, Hyundai recalled about 239,000 cars in the U.S. because of a seat belt issue. Given this precedent and the specific nature of the recall mentioned (seatbelt system), it's plausible that Hyundai might face a similar issue again. However, the scale of the recall (over 720,000 vehicles) is quite large, which makes it less likely. The timeframe (by August 2024) gives about 14 months for this to occur, which is a reasonable amount of time for such an issue to be discovered and addressed.

A 20% increase is more modest and achievable, especially given Hyundai's focus on electric vehicles and premium models. The global economic situation and automotive market trends will play a crucial role.

In 2023, Brazil's GDP grew by 2.9%, surpassing expectations. The country has been implementing economic reforms and benefiting from high commodity prices. However, there are concerns about global economic slowdown and potential impacts on Brazil's exports. The Central Bank of Brazil has been cautious with its monetary policy, which could help stabilize the economy. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Brazil avoiding a recession by July 2024 at around 70%. b) Hang Seng Index reaching or exceeding 30,000 points by August 2024: As of June 2023, the Hang Seng Index is trading around 19,000 points. Reaching 30,000 points would require a significant increase of over 50%. The Hong Kong market has been facing challenges due to China's economic slowdown, regulatory crackdowns, and geopolitical tensions. However, there are potential positive factors such as China's economic recovery efforts and possible easing of tensions with the US. Still, a 50% increase in about a year is a substantial ask. I would estimate the probability of the Hang Seng Index reaching 30,000 points by August 2024 at around 20%.

Meta's current strategy and focus: Meta (formerly Facebook) has been increasingly interested in expanding its presence in the digital media and entertainment space. They have been investing in virtual and augmented reality technologies, which could potentially be applied to sports broadcasting. 2. Previous partnerships: Meta has already shown interest in sports partnerships. For example, they have partnered with the NBA for VR experiences and have streamed some MLB games on Facebook Watch in the past. 3. Competition in the sports media rights market: The sports media rights market is highly competitive, with traditional broadcasters and streaming giants like Amazon and Apple actively pursuing deals. This competition might make it more challenging for Meta to secure a major partnership. 4. Time frame: The question gives about a year (from the creation date to the resolution date) for Meta to announce such a partnership. This is a reasonable amount of time for negotiations and deal-making in the sports media industry. 5. Meta's financial capabilities: As one of the largest tech companies in the world, Meta has the financial resources to pursue major sports media partnerships if they choose to do so. 6. Potential benefits for Meta: A major sports media partnership could help Meta attract more users to its platforms and increase engagement, aligning with their overall business goals. 7. Changing landscape of sports broadcasting: With the rise of streaming and digital platforms, sports leagues are increasingly open to non-traditional partnerships, which could benefit Meta. However, there are also factors that might decrease the likelihood: 1. Meta's other priorities: The company has been focusing heavily on developing the 'metaverse' and may prioritize resources towards that goal rather than traditional sports broadcasting. 2. Regulatory scrutiny: Meta has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, which might make some sports organizations hesitant to partner with them. 3. Lack of track record: Unlike some competitors, Meta doesn't have a long history of major sports broadcasting, which might put them at a disadvantage when negotiating for top-tier rights. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance that Meta will announce a major sports media partnership by July 2024.

Current economic conditions: As of late 2023, Turkey's economy is still facing challenges, including a weakening currency and high inflation, despite some efforts to stabilize the situation. 3. Central Bank policies: The Central Bank of Turkey has been under pressure to lower interest rates, which can contribute to higher inflation.

A 0.5% monthly increase is significant but not extreme in the context of Turkey's recent economic history. 5. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 10 months (October 2023 to July 2024), which provides multiple opportunities for such an increase to occur. 6.

Given these considerations, I believe there is a high likelihood that Turkey will experience at least one month with an inflation increase exceeding 0.5% within the specified timeframe. The country's recent history of high inflation, combined with ongoing economic challenges and the relatively long period covered by the question, makes such an occurrence quite probable. However, it's important to note that there are efforts to control inflation, and the situation could improve.

Current state of education policy in South Carolina: As of now, South Carolina does not have a statewide free community college program. The state has some scholarship programs, but nothing comprehensive for all community college students. 2. Political landscape: South Carolina is a predominantly conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature and governor's office. Traditionally, such political environments are less likely to implement broad, publicly-funded education initiatives. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is just over a year away from the creation date of this question. Implementing a statewide free community college plan is a significant undertaking that typically requires extensive planning, budgeting, and legislative action. This timeframe is quite short for such a major policy change. 4. National trends: While some states have implemented free community college programs, these tend to be more progressive-leaning states. South Carolina has not shown indications of following this trend. 5. Economic considerations: Free community college programs require substantial funding. Given the economic challenges many states face, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be difficult to allocate the necessary resources for such a program. 6. Lack of current public discussion: There doesn't appear to be any significant public discourse or political momentum in South Carolina for a free community college plan at this time. 7. Educational priorities: South Carolina may have other educational priorities that take precedence over free community college, such as K-12 funding or support for four-year institutions. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that South Carolina will implement a free community college plan by July 2024. The short timeframe, conservative political landscape, lack of current discussion on the topic, and potential budget constraints all work against the likelihood of this occurring.

Inflation outlook: The BoE's primary mandate is to maintain price stability, targeting 2% inflation. If inflation shows signs of easing by early 2024, it could pave the way for rate cuts. 3. Economic growth: If the UK economy shows signs of slowing down or entering a recession, the BoE might be more inclined to cut rates to stimulate growth. 4. Global economic trends: The actions of other major central banks, such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, could influence the BoE's decision. 5. Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut by July 2024, which gives the BoE about a year from now to make this decision. This is a significant amount of time for economic conditions to change. 6. Historical precedent: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates after a tightening cycle unless there's a significant economic downturn or a rapid decline in inflation. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut by July 2024. The BoE will likely want to see sustained evidence of inflation moving towards its 2% target before considering rate cuts. However, if economic growth slows significantly or if there's a global economic downturn, the BoE might be pressured to cut rates sooner. The time frame of about a year provides enough time for economic conditions to potentially warrant a rate cut, but it's not so long that it becomes highly likely.

The implementation of such a plan would require significant legislative action, budget allocation, and planning, which typically takes considerable time.

As of June 2023, the UK has been experiencing high inflation, which led to interest rate increases. For the Bank to cut rates by July 2024, we would need to see a significant improvement in inflation and potentially some economic challenges that would warrant stimulus. While it's possible that economic conditions could change rapidly, the current trend and the Bank's recent statements suggest they are more focused on controlling inflation than stimulating growth. However, a year is a long time in economic terms, and a rate cut by July 2024 is more plausible than the South Carolina policy change.

Current trend: As of June 2023, weekly jobless claims have been consistently below 200,000 for several months. This indicates a strong labor market and suggests that a significant deterioration would be needed to reach the specified threshold. 2. Economic outlook: While there are concerns about a potential recession, many economists believe that if a recession occurs, it's likely to be mild. The Federal Reserve's actions to combat inflation may lead to some job losses, but a dramatic spike in unemployment is not widely expected. 3. Historical context: During the COVID-19 pandemic, jobless claims spiked well above 200,000, but this was an extraordinary circumstance. In more normal economic times, sustained periods of claims above 200,000 are less common. 4. Time frame: The question allows for this scenario to occur at any point until August 2024, which is over a year away. This extended period increases the chances of economic conditions changing significantly. 5. Labor market resilience: The U.S. labor market has shown remarkable resilience in recent years, bouncing back quickly from the pandemic-induced recession. This suggests that even if there is an economic downturn, the labor market might be able to absorb shocks better than in past recessions. 6.

However, there are signs that inflation is cooling, which could lead to a pause or even a reversal in rate hikes by 2024. 3.

Condition A: U.S. weekly jobless claims exceed 200,000 for four consecutive weeks. As of June 2023, U.S. weekly jobless claims have been relatively low, often below 200,000. However, there are several factors that could lead to an increase in jobless claims: 1. Economic slowdown: Many economists predict a potential recession in late 2023 or early 2024. 2.

Such referendums are typically preceded by significant public debate, legislative action, or grassroots campaigns. Without any clear indication of such activities, the likelihood of this occurring within the given timeframe seems low.

(b) Virginia's Medicaid plan with work requirements enrolling at least 25,000 beneficiaries by July 31, 2024: Virginia has been working on implementing Medicaid work requirements, but there have been significant challenges and delays. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a pause in many states' Medicaid work requirement plans. Additionally, the Biden administration has been generally opposed to Medicaid work requirements, making it less likely that such programs will be approved or implemented. Even if Virginia manages to implement the work requirements, enrolling 25,000 beneficiaries under these new conditions within a year is ambitious, especially given the potential legal challenges and administrative hurdles. Considering both conditions together, the probability becomes even lower. Both events are individually unlikely, and for the question to resolve as YES, both need to occur.

However, their global presence in sports media is relatively limited compared to other major media companies. 2. Market trends: The sports media rights market is highly competitive, with traditional broadcasters and streaming platforms vying for valuable content. There's a growing trend of tech companies and streaming services entering this space. 3. Sony's strategic direction: Sony has been focusing on expanding its entertainment and content offerings. A major sports partnership could align with this strategy to strengthen its position in the media landscape. 4. Time frame: The question gives about a year for Sony to make such an announcement. This is a reasonable amount of time for negotiations and deals to be made in the sports media industry. 5. Potential opportunities: Several major sports leagues have media rights coming up for renewal in the near future, which could present opportunities for Sony. 6.

Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of Sony announcing a major sports media partnership by July 2024.

(a) Sony announcing a new major sports media partnership: Sony is a major player in the entertainment industry, but they're not traditionally known for sports media rights. However, they have been expanding their presence in the sports market. In 2021, they acquired Hawk-Eye Innovations, a sports technology company. This suggests they might be interested in further sports-related ventures. The timeframe of about a year gives Sony ample time to negotiate and announce a partnership if they're actively pursuing one. However, major sports media rights are often tied up in long-term contracts, which could limit opportunities. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. (b) Paramount and Skydance announcing a merger agreement: There have been rumors and speculation about potential mergers or acquisitions involving Paramount (formerly ViacomCBS) for some time. Skydance Media has been growing rapidly and has worked closely with Paramount on several projects. In January 2024, there were reports of Skydance exploring a potential merger with Paramount. While these talks were reportedly preliminary, it indicates there's interest from both parties. The media landscape is continuously evolving, with consolidation being a common trend. Given the existing relationship between the companies and the current market conditions, I'd estimate the probability of this merger announcement at around 40%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.30 * 0.40 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent. If one major media deal (like the Paramount-Skydance merger) occurs, it might slightly increase the likelihood of other big moves in the industry (like Sony's sports partnership).

Potential challenges: The pharmaceutical industry may attempt to challenge or delay the implementation of negotiated prices through legal action or lobbying efforts.

This is a significant amount of time for the company to have stabilized its operations and financial position. 3. Post-bankruptcy performance: Since emerging from bankruptcy in 2021, Frontier has been focusing on expanding its fiber network and improving its services. The company has been making progress in its fiber expansion plans, which is a positive sign for its future prospects. 4. Industry trends: The telecommunications industry, particularly the fiber internet sector, has been growing due to increased demand for high-speed internet. This trend favors Frontier's business model and growth strategy. 5. Financial stability: While I don't have specific recent financial data, companies that emerge from bankruptcy typically have a more stable financial position due to debt restructuring and operational improvements. 6. Lack of recent bankruptcy news: There have been no widely reported indications that Frontier is considering or at risk of filing for bankruptcy again as of the creation date of this question (June 2024). Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Frontier Communications would be in bankruptcy proceedings in July 2024, let alone needing to emerge from them. The company has already gone through this process and has been operating post-bankruptcy for several years. The only scenario where this question could resolve as YES is if Frontier had filed for bankruptcy again very recently (around the time this question was created) and was on an extremely accelerated timeline to emerge by July 2024. However, such a scenario is highly improbable given the typical length of bankruptcy proceedings and the lack of any indications of such a filing.

ALJs are generally subject to the ethical standards of the agencies they work for and the broader federal employee ethics rules. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is about a year away. This is a relatively short period for developing, approving, and implementing a new ethics code, especially considering the bureaucratic processes involved in federal government decision-making. Political climate: The current political environment in the U.S. is highly polarized, which can make it challenging to pass new regulations or codes, especially those that affect the judiciary or administrative processes. Recent discussions: There have been ongoing discussions about the need for a more specific ethics code for ALJs, particularly in light of concerns about impartiality and conflicts of interest. However, these discussions have not yet resulted in concrete action towards establishing such a code. Complexity of the task: Creating an enforceable ethics code that applies to all ALJs across various federal agencies is a complex task that requires careful consideration of different agency needs, existing rules, and potential legal challenges. Enforcement mechanisms: The question specifies that the code must be enforceable, which adds another layer of complexity to its development and implementation. Lack of urgent catalyst: While there is ongoing discussion about the need for such a code, there doesn't appear to be a major scandal or urgent situation driving immediate action on this issue. Bureaucratic inertia: Government agencies often move slowly in implementing new regulations or codes, especially when they affect a large number of employees across multiple agencies. Given these factors, while it's possible that an ethics code could be established by July 2024, it seems unlikely.

The current 12-week ban is relatively recent, and there might not be immediate political will to push for further restrictions so soon. 2. Total abortion bans are controversial and often face significant public opposition and legal challenges. 3.

However, expanding to Lyft's platform by August 2024 is not guaranteed. Some factors to consider: - Waymo and Lyft have collaborated in the past, which could facilitate this partnership. - Regulatory hurdles and safety concerns might slow down the expansion. - The timeline (about 14 months from now) is relatively short for such a significant rollout. - Competition in the autonomous vehicle market is intense, which could accelerate developments.

Current jobless claims trends: As of June 2023, weekly jobless claims have been hovering around 220,000-230,000, which is below the 250,000 threshold. 2. Economic outlook: The U.S. economy has been showing signs of resilience, with a strong job market and relatively low unemployment rates. However, there are concerns about potential economic slowdown or recession in the near future. 3. Federal Reserve policies: The Fed has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could potentially lead to job market cooling. 4. Historical patterns: During economic downturns, jobless claims tend to rise. However, reaching and sustaining levels above 250,000 for four consecutive weeks would indicate a significant deterioration in the job market. 5. Time frame: The question spans from now until August 2024, giving over a year for this scenario to potentially unfold. 6. Potential external factors: Unforeseen events such as global economic shocks, geopolitical tensions, or new pandemics could impact the job market. Given these considerations, I believe there is a moderate chance of this scenario occurring. The U.S. economy has been resilient, but there are increasing concerns about a potential recession. If a recession does occur within the next year, it could lead to a spike in jobless claims. However, for claims to exceed 250,000 for four consecutive weeks would require a fairly significant economic downturn. The time frame of over a year provides ample opportunity for economic conditions to change, potentially leading to increased unemployment. However, it's also possible that any economic difficulties could be short-lived or not severe enough to push jobless claims above 250,000 for an extended period.

U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 250,000 for four consecutive weeks: As of June 2023, U.S. weekly jobless claims have been relatively low, generally below 250,000. However, there are several factors that could lead to an increase in jobless claims: - Economic slowdown or recession: Many economists predict a potential recession in late 2023 or early 2024. - Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes: These could lead to job losses as companies adjust to higher borrowing costs. - Technological disruptions: AI and automation might cause job displacements in certain sectors. Given these factors, there's a moderate chance of seeing jobless claims exceed 250,000 for four consecutive weeks by August 2024. I'd estimate this probability at around 40%. 2. Central Bank of Vietnam announcing an interest rate cut: The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has been maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy to combat inflation and support the Vietnamese dong. However, several factors could lead to a rate cut: - Global economic slowdown: If major economies face recession, Vietnam might need to stimulate its economy. - Easing inflation pressures: If inflation in Vietnam continues to moderate, it could give room for rate cuts. - Export sector support: Rate cuts could help boost exports if global demand weakens. Given these considerations, there's a reasonable chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. I'd estimate this probability at around 60%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.40 * 0.60 = 0.24. However, it's important to note that these events are not entirely independent.

Current energy policy: Spain has been phasing out nuclear power, with plans to close all existing nuclear plants by 2035. This suggests a general move away from nuclear energy. 2. Existing plans: The question mentions two currently planned reactors. This indicates that Spain has already made some commitments to nuclear power, which could potentially be expanded. 3. Climate goals: Spain, like many European countries, is under pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Nuclear power is a low-carbon energy source, which could make it attractive for meeting climate targets. 4. Public opinion: Nuclear power is often controversial, and public opinion can significantly influence government decisions. Spain has historically had mixed views on nuclear energy. 5. Economic factors: Building new nuclear reactors is extremely expensive and time-consuming. Given the current global economic uncertainties, this could be a deterrent. 6. Renewable energy focus: Spain has been investing heavily in renewable energy sources like wind and solar. This might reduce the perceived need for nuclear power. 7. Short timeframe: The question asks about an announcement by July 2024, which is only about a month away from the question's creation date. This is a very short time for a major policy shift, especially on such a significant issue. 8. European energy security: The ongoing energy crisis in Europe, partly due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, might push countries to reconsider nuclear power for energy security reasons. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Spain would announce plans for additional nuclear reactors beyond the two currently planned by July 2024. The existing policy direction, focus on renewables, and the very short timeframe are significant obstacles.

Time frame: The question spans until August 2024, which is after the next general election in Mexico (scheduled for June 2024). The political landscape could change after this election, potentially affecting the Senate's composition and its alignment with the President. 3. Economic pressures: Mexico, like many countries, faces economic challenges that might necessitate reforms. However, L\u00f3pez Obrador has been known for his resistance to certain types of economic reforms, especially those perceived as neoliberal. 4. Historical precedent: The Mexican Senate has not frequently passed major economic reforms against the wishes of a sitting president, especially one with strong party support in the legislature. 5. International factors: Pressure from international bodies or trade partners could potentially push for economic reforms, but L\u00f3pez Obrador has shown resistance to external influences on domestic policy. 6. L\u00f3pez Obrador's term: His term ends in September 2024, shortly after the resolution date. This might reduce the likelihood of major reforms being pushed through against his will in his final months. 7. Definition of \"major\": The criteria for what constitutes a \"major\" reform and clear opposition from the President set a high bar for this event to occur. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the Mexican Senate would pass a major economic reform bill explicitly opposed by President L\u00f3pez Obrador by August 2024. The current political alignment, the President's known stance on economic policies, and the historical rarity of such events all point towards a low probability. However, the upcoming election and potential economic pressures introduce some uncertainty. There's a small chance that a shift in the Senate's composition after the 2024 election, combined with urgent economic needs, could lead to such a bill being passed in the short window between the election and August 2024."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "f9ac8887-35fd-47ab-a176-3b232803eae3", "title": "Will both of the following occur by August 2024: (a) the Central Bank of the Philippines announces an interest rate cut and (b) Mexico's Senate passes a major economic reform bill opposed by President L\u00f3pez Obrador?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following occur by August 31, 2024: \n\n(a) The Central Bank of the Philippines officially announces an interest rate cut to take effect by August 31, 2024.

(a) Central Bank of the Philippines interest rate cut: The Philippines, like many other countries, has been dealing with high inflation rates. As of June 2023, the central bank has been maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation. However, by August 2024, more than a year from now, the economic situation could change significantly. If inflation shows signs of easing, the central bank might consider cutting rates to stimulate economic growth. Given the timeframe and the potential for economic shifts, there's a moderate chance of this occurring, perhaps around 40%. (b) Mexico's Senate passing a major economic reform bill opposed by President L\u00f3pez Obrador: This is a more complex political situation. President L\u00f3pez Obrador, known for his populist policies, has significant influence over his party, which holds a majority in the Senate. However, his term ends in September 2024, just after the resolution date of this question. As his presidency nears its end, there might be more willingness among senators to challenge his positions. Additionally, opposition parties might push for reforms in anticipation of the upcoming change in administration. Still, passing a 'major' economic reform bill that explicitly opposes the President's stance is a significant challenge. The probability of this occurring is lower, perhaps around 30%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.40 * 0.30 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent.

This is a relatively short period for a complex legal issue to be fully resolved, especially if it needs to go through multiple court levels. 3. Political climate: Indiana is a conservative state, which might increase the likelihood of the ban being upheld. However, abortion rights have been a contentious issue nationwide, with mixed results in different states. 4. Legal precedent: The overturning of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 has allowed states to implement stricter abortion laws. This could potentially work in favor of Indiana's ban being upheld. 5. Judicial process: The question specifies that the ruling must come from an Indiana state court. This narrows the scope and potentially speeds up the process compared to federal court involvement. 6. Similar cases: Other states with strict abortion laws have seen mixed results in court challenges, with some laws being upheld and others struck down. 7. Public opinion: While not directly influencing court decisions, public opinion can indirectly affect the urgency and approach to legal challenges.

However, these discussions have not yet resulted in concrete action. 5. Precedent: The Supreme Court and federal judges have their own codes of conduct, which could serve as a model. However, the unique position of ALJs (being part of the executive branch rather than the judicial branch) complicates the matter. 6.

This has led to widespread criticism and calls for institutions to remove the Sackler name from their buildings. 2. Harvard's current stance: As of now, Harvard has not removed Arthur Sackler's name from any buildings, despite pressure from activists and students.

Argentina has a robust healthcare system and has experience dealing with infectious diseases. Given that we're looking at a timeframe until July 2024, which is more than a year away, it's quite likely that any current or near-future outbreak would be contained and declared over by then.

Precedent: While some states have added privacy protections to their constitutions (e.g., California), it's not a common occurrence, and Virginia hasn't shown signs of following this trend imminently. 6. Political priorities: With various other issues competing for attention (e.g., economic recovery, education, healthcare), it's uncertain whether privacy rights would take precedence to the point of fast-tracking a constitutional amendment. 7. Potential catalysts: A major data breach or privacy scandal could potentially accelerate interest in constitutional privacy protections, but such events are unpredictable. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Virginia to hold such a referendum by July 2024, it seems unlikely. The lack of current proposals, the short timeline, and the complex process for constitutional amendments all work against this outcome.

However, there are concerns about high household debt levels and a potential housing market correction. The timeframe for this condition (October 2023 to July 2024) is relatively short, which reduces the risk of a recession occurring.

Economic factors: Given the current abundance of domestic natural gas, there's little economic incentive to consider new LNG import projects. Political considerations: Energy independence has been a bipartisan goal in the U.S. Resuming consideration of LNG import projects could be seen as a step backward from this goal. Global energy market: While global events could theoretically create a sudden need for increased LNG imports, such a drastic shift in the energy landscape within a month is highly unlikely. Existing infrastructure: The U.S. already has LNG import terminals, many of which have been converted to export terminals.

Process for constitutional amendments: In Virginia, to amend the state constitution, a proposed amendment must pass both houses of the General Assembly in two consecutive years, and then be approved by voters in a referendum. 4. Timeline: The question asks about a referendum by August 2024, which is a relatively short timeframe for a constitutional amendment process. 5. Recent trends: Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, several states have moved to protect abortion rights through constitutional amendments or referendums. 6. Legislative sessions: The Virginia General Assembly typically meets from January to March each year, which means there would need to be quick action in the 2023 and 2024 sessions to meet the August 2024 deadline. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Virginia will hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: 1. The divided government makes it challenging to pass the necessary legislation in both chambers for two consecutive years. 2. The timeline is very tight, requiring swift action that is uncommon for constitutional amendments. 3. While there is national momentum for protecting abortion rights, Virginia's current law already provides significant protections, which may reduce the urgency for a constitutional amendment. 4. The process for amending the constitution is deliberately slow and requires broad consensus, which is difficult to achieve in the current political climate. However, it's not entirely impossible. The issue of abortion rights remains highly salient nationally, and there could be significant public pressure to enshrine these rights in the state constitution. Additionally, if there were a shift in the political makeup of the legislature in the 2023 elections, it could potentially accelerate the process. Considering all these factors, I would assign a low probability to this event occurring within the specified timeframe."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "8341274d-299f-4ec2-8dbe-6e16f55c0cbf", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) the Arkansas Senate passes a total abortion ban by July 2024, and (b) Virginia holds a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following conditions are met: (a) By July 31, 2024, the Arkansas Senate successfully passes legislation enacting a total abortion ban.

(a) Arkansas Senate passing a total abortion ban by July 2024: Arkansas is a conservative state with a history of passing strict abortion laws. In 2019, they passed a near-total abortion ban that was later blocked by the courts. Given the current political climate and the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it's plausible that Arkansas might attempt to pass another strict abortion law. However, the timeframe is relatively short (about a month from the question's creation date to the deadline), which reduces the likelihood. Additionally, Arkansas already has significant abortion restrictions in place, which might reduce the urgency for a total ban. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 0.4. (b) Virginia holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: Virginia is a politically competitive state that has seen shifts in its stance on abortion rights. However, holding a referendum on a constitutional issue is a significant undertaking that requires legislative approval and planning. As of now, there are no publicly known plans for such a referendum in Virginia. The timeframe (about two months) is very short for organizing a statewide referendum. Moreover, Virginia typically addresses such issues through legislative action rather than direct referendums. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 0.1. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04.

This makes it less likely for stricter abortion regulations to be enacted. However, the Pennsylvania state legislature has a Republican majority in both chambers, which could push for stricter regulations. Given the short timeframe (about a month) and the divided government, it seems unlikely that new, stricter regulations would be enacted and implemented by July 2024. (b) Michigan removing the work requirement from its Medicaid plan: Michigan has already faced legal challenges to its Medicaid work requirements. In March 2020, a federal judge blocked Michigan's Medicaid work requirements. The Biden administration has been generally opposed to Medicaid work requirements and has been working to roll them back in various states. Michigan has a Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and a Democratic-controlled legislature, making it more likely for them to officially remove the work requirement. Given these factors, it seems highly probable that Michigan will remove the work requirement from its Medicaid plan by July 2024, if it hasn't already done so. For both events to occur, we need (a) AND (b) to happen. While (b) seems very likely, (a) appears unlikely given the current political landscape and short timeframe.

Typical bankruptcy timeline: Chapter 11 bankruptcies can take anywhere from a few months to several years, depending on the complexity of the case. Given the size and complexity of Bed Bath & Beyond's operations, 15 months is a relatively short timeframe. 3. Company's financial situation: Bed Bath & Beyond has been struggling for years, facing declining sales, management changes, and increased competition from online retailers. This suggests a significant restructuring effort will be needed. 4. Industry trends: The retail sector, particularly brick-and-mortar stores, continues to face challenges from e-commerce competition and changing consumer habits. 5. Potential buyers: There have been reports of interested buyers for parts of the business, which could potentially expedite the restructuring process. 6. Precedents: Other large retailers like J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus emerged from bankruptcy within 4-6 months, showing that it's possible to complete the process quickly. 7. Economic conditions: The overall economic environment, including inflation and consumer spending patterns, could impact the company's ability to successfully restructure. 8. Court and creditor cooperation: The speed of emergence depends partly on how quickly the court can process the case and how cooperative creditors are in accepting a reorganization plan. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Bed Bath & Beyond could emerge from bankruptcy by July 2024. The 15-month timeframe is challenging but not impossible. However, the company's long-standing financial troubles and the complex nature of retail restructuring make it far from certain.

This is a significant amount of time for the company to have stabilized its operations and financial position. 3.

Likelihood of another bankruptcy: It's relatively uncommon for a company to file for bankruptcy again so soon after emerging from a previous bankruptcy, especially if they've undergone significant restructuring. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Frontier Communications would be in bankruptcy proceedings in July 2024. The company has already gone through a bankruptcy process, emerged, and has had several years to stabilize its operations.

Bed Bath & Beyond: Bed Bath & Beyond filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2023. The company has already begun liquidating its assets and closing stores. In June 2023, it was announced that Overstock.com would acquire Bed Bath & Beyond's intellectual property and digital assets. This suggests that Bed Bath & Beyond as we knew it will likely cease to exist, rather than reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy. 2. Frontier Communications: Frontier Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2020 and emerged from bankruptcy in April 2021 with a reorganization plan that reduced its debt by more than $10 billion. The company has already completed its bankruptcy proceedings and is currently operating post-reorganization. Given these facts: - Bed Bath & Beyond is unlikely to emerge from bankruptcy as a reorganized company. Instead, it appears to be in the process of liquidation and selling off its assets. - Frontier Communications has already emerged from bankruptcy in 2021, well before the July 2024 deadline specified in the question. For both companies to emerge from bankruptcy by July 2024, Bed Bath & Beyond would need to unexpectedly reverse course, halt its liquidation, propose a viable reorganization plan, and have it approved by the court - all within a relatively short timeframe.

This is a relatively long period for negotiations, which could increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement. 2. Importance of job security: Job security is a critical issue for unions, especially in the face of technological advancements and potential automation in the railway industry. This suggests that the union will likely push hard for such provisions in any new agreement. 3. Current labor market conditions: The labor market has been tight in recent years, which generally gives unions more bargaining power. This could increase the chances of reaching an agreement that addresses job security. 4. Historical context: Union Pacific has a history of negotiating with unions, and while negotiations can be contentious, agreements are often eventually reached. However, specific job security provisions might be a sticking point. 5. Industry trends: The railway industry is facing pressure to increase efficiency and reduce costs, which might make Union Pacific resistant to strong job security provisions. This could potentially prolong negotiations. 6. Public pressure and potential for strikes: If negotiations drag on, there might be increased public pressure or the threat of strikes, which could push both parties towards an agreement. 7.

However, recent trends across the US have shown courts striking down similar bans in other states. The Supreme Court's Dobbs decision returned abortion regulation to the states, but many state courts have found extreme restrictions unconstitutional under state constitutions. Given that this ban was already blocked once, there's a significant chance it could be found unconstitutional. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. 2.

Given the conservative majority in the Arizona state courts and the overall conservative leaning of the state, there is a possibility that the ban could be upheld.

Current status: Intelsat filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May 2020. As of now (June 2023), they have been in bankruptcy proceedings for over three years. 2. Progress in restructuring: In February 2022, Intelsat announced that it had emerged from bankruptcy after completing a financial restructuring process. However, this question suggests that Intelsat is still in bankruptcy proceedings, which implies that the previous emergence might not have been complete or that they faced new financial challenges. 3. Time frame: The question asks about emergence by July 2024, which is about a year from now. This provides a reasonable amount of time for the company to complete its restructuring process if it's still ongoing. 4. Industry trends: The satellite communications industry has been facing challenges due to the rise of terrestrial networks and new satellite technologies. However, there's also increasing demand for satellite services in various sectors. 5. Company performance: Without specific information about Intelsat's current financial performance and restructuring progress, it's difficult to make a precise assessment. 6. Typical bankruptcy duration: Chapter 11 bankruptcies typically last between 6 months to 2 years, but complex cases can take longer. Intelsat's case has already exceeded this typical timeframe. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high probability that Intelsat will emerge from bankruptcy by July 2024. The extended time they've already spent in bankruptcy proceedings suggests that they're likely in the final stages of restructuring. The one-year timeframe until July 2024 provides additional time to resolve any remaining issues.

Historical context: The last time jobless claims were consistently above 275,000 was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Before that, it was during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. 3. Economic outlook: While there are concerns about a potential recession, most economists don't predict a severe downturn that would cause jobless claims to spike dramatically. 4. Federal Reserve actions: The Fed has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could potentially slow job growth. However, their goal is a 'soft landing' that avoids significant job losses. 5. Labor market resilience: The U.S. job market has shown remarkable resilience in recent years, bouncing back quickly from the pandemic-induced recession. 6. Timeframe: The question asks about a period of about 14 months (from now until August 2024), which is a relatively short time for such a significant change in jobless claims. 7. Threshold: 275,000 is a high threshold that would represent a significant deterioration in the job market. It would need to be sustained for two consecutive weeks, which is even more challenging. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that jobless claims will exceed 275,000 for two consecutive weeks by August 2024. While it's not impossible, especially if there's an unexpected economic shock or a severe recession, the current economic indicators and forecasts don't support such a scenario. However, we must also consider the uncertainty in economic forecasting, especially over a 14-month period. Unexpected events (like the COVID-19 pandemic) can dramatically change the economic landscape quickly.

However, economic conditions can change rapidly, and there are several factors to consider: 1. Economic uncertainty: The possibility of a recession or economic slowdown could lead to increased layoffs. 2.

Technological disruptions: Advancements in AI and automation might lead to job displacements in certain sectors. 4. Global economic factors: International trade tensions or global economic downturns could impact the U.S. job market. While the current job market is strong, there's a significant time window (over a year) for conditions to change. The threshold of 275,000 weekly jobless claims is not extremely high compared to historical standards, making it more plausible to be reached if economic conditions deteriorate. Considering both conditions together: The first condition (a) is already met, so the probability of this question resolving as YES depends entirely on condition (b).

The criteria for the strike (1,000+ participants, lasting at least a week) make it a significant event. The resolution timeframe (by July 2024) gives about a year for such a strike to occur and be resolved. Labor disputes often arise during contract negotiations or due to economic pressures.

(b) Central Bank of Russia announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: The Central Bank of Russia adjusts interest rates regularly based on economic conditions. Russia's economy has been under pressure due to sanctions and geopolitical tensions. The bank might cut rates to stimulate economic growth if inflation is under control. However, geopolitical uncertainties and potential further sanctions could limit the bank's ability to cut rates. The timeframe (by August 2024) provides over a year for economic conditions to potentially warrant a rate cut. The probability of this occurring is moderate to high, around 50-60%.

National trends: While there's ongoing debate about gun control measures across the U.S., there isn't a strong national movement specifically against waiting periods that might influence Maine's decision. 5. Potential legal challenges: Gun rights groups often challenge new gun control laws in court. However, waiting periods have generally been upheld as constitutional in other states, reducing the likelihood of a successful legal challenge within this timeframe. 6.

This is an important starting point, as it means a strike would need to begin and then persist for an extended period. 2. Historical context: Norway has experienced oil worker strikes in the past, but they typically don't last for extremely long periods. For example, a significant strike in 2012 lasted for about two weeks. 3. Labor relations in Norway: The country has a strong tradition of collective bargaining and generally good relations between unions and employers. This often leads to relatively quick resolutions of labor disputes. 4. Economic impact: Prolonged strikes in the oil sector can have significant economic consequences for Norway, which often motivates both sides to reach agreements relatively quickly. 5. Time frame: The question asks about a strike lasting through August 2024, which is about two months from the question's creation date. While not impossible, it's relatively uncommon for strikes in this sector to last that long. 6. Government intervention: In cases where strikes threaten the national economy, the Norwegian government has the power to intervene and force a resolution. This further reduces the likelihood of a very long-lasting strike. 7. Negotiation cycles: Many labor agreements in Norway are negotiated on a regular cycle. If a new negotiation is due around this time, it could increase the chance of a strike, but also the likelihood of a resolution before August. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that a strike would both start and persist through August 2024. While it's certainly possible for a strike to occur, the combination of Norway's labor relations practices, the economic importance of the oil sector, and the potential for government intervention make it improbable that such a strike would last for an extended period into August."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "75027033-4247-46b1-91e8-3a27446794ab", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) the Italian economy avoid a recession by July 2024 and (b) Norwegian oil workers remain on strike through August 2024?", "body": "(a) This question resolves as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the Italian economy does not enter a recession.

(a) Italian economy avoiding recession by July 2024: Italy's economy has been showing signs of resilience despite global economic challenges. However, predicting economic performance over a year in advance is challenging due to various factors such as global economic conditions, political stability, and external shocks. The European Central Bank's monetary policies, Italy's fiscal measures, and global economic trends will play crucial roles. Given Italy's recent economic performance and the efforts to stimulate growth, there's a moderate chance of avoiding a recession. Let's estimate this probability at 0.6. (b) Norwegian oil workers remaining on strike through August 2024: Labor disputes in the oil sector are not uncommon, but they typically don't last for extended periods due to their significant economic impact. The question is set for over a year in the future, and it's unlikely that a strike would continue for such a long duration without resolution. Historically, most oil worker strikes in Norway have been resolved within weeks or a few months at most. The probability of a strike lasting through August 2024 is quite low. Let's estimate this probability at 0.1. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.6 * 0.1 = 0.06.

Current situation: As of June 2024, 15-year fixed-rate mortgages are typically lower than 30-year rates. While I don't have the exact current rate, it's important to note that rates have been volatile in recent years due to economic uncertainties and Federal Reserve policies. 2. Federal Reserve policy: The Fed's monetary policy significantly impacts mortgage rates. If the Fed continues to maintain higher interest rates to combat inflation, this could push mortgage rates up. However, if inflation shows signs of cooling, the Fed might ease its stance, potentially lowering rates. 3. Economic conditions: The overall state of the economy, including GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation, will play a crucial role. A strong economy might lead to higher rates, while economic challenges could keep rates lower. 4. Housing market: The demand for housing and the overall health of the real estate market can influence mortgage rates. A hot housing market might lead to higher rates, while a cooler market could keep rates lower. 5. Global economic factors: International economic conditions and geopolitical events can impact U.S. mortgage rates indirectly through their effect on the bond market. 6. Time frame: The question asks about August 2024, which is only about two months from the creation date of this question. This relatively short time frame makes dramatic changes less likely, but not impossible. 7. Historical context: Mortgage rates have been historically low in recent years, but they have shown the capacity for rapid increases when economic conditions change. 8. Threshold: The question specifies that the rate must exceed 5.5%, not just reach it. This sets a clear and somewhat high bar, given recent trends. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that the 15-year mortgage rate will exceed 5.5% by August 2024.

Condition (a): The average rate on a 15-year mortgage exceeding 5.5% by August 2024. As of June 2023, the average 15-year fixed mortgage rate in the US is around 5.7-5.8%. While rates have been volatile in recent years due to economic uncertainty and inflation concerns, they are currently at a relatively high level. For this condition to be met, rates would need to remain elevated or increase further over the next year. Given the current economic climate and the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation, it's plausible that rates could remain above 5.5% by August 2024. However, there's also a possibility of rates decreasing if inflation is brought under control or if economic conditions worsen.

This would likely occur if inflation is brought under control or if economic conditions deteriorate significantly. While it's possible, it's less likely given the current trajectory of monetary policy. Central banks typically move cautiously, and a complete reversal within a year is not common unless there's a significant economic shock. I would estimate the probability of this condition being met at about 30%. Combined probability: For both conditions to be met, we need to consider the joint probability. These events are not entirely independent, as global economic conditions affect both US mortgage rates and Canadian monetary policy. However, they are also not perfectly correlated. Given the lower probability of the BoC cutting rates, this becomes the limiting factor. Even if US mortgage rates stay high, the question will only resolve as YES if the BoC also cuts rates.
