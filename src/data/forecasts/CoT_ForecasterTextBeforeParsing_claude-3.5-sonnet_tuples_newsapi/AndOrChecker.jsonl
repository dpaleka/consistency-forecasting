Quality control measures: Coca-Cola, as a large multinational corporation, likely has stringent quality control measures in place to prevent contamination. They use advanced technology and processes to ensure product safety. 3. Supply chain complexity: With a global supply chain, there's always a risk of contamination at various stages of production, packaging, or distribution. However, Coca-Cola's scale also means they have resources to monitor and control these risks effectively. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 14 months (from the creation date to the resolution date). This is a significant amount of time during which an incident could occur, but it's not an extremely long period. 5. Regulatory environment: Food safety regulations are strict in most countries where Coca-Cola operates, which encourages companies to maintain high standards but also increases the likelihood of recalls if any issues are detected. 6. Public scrutiny: As a high-profile company, Coca-Cola is under constant public and media scrutiny, which might lead to quicker action (including recalls) if any potential issues arise. 7. Rarity of metal contamination: Metal contamination is less common than other types of contamination (like bacterial contamination) in the beverage industry. Considering these factors, while a recall due to metal contamination is possible, it seems relatively unlikely. Coca-Cola's quality control measures and the rarity of metal contamination in beverages work against this possibility.

Given the short timeframe (about 14 months from the question's creation date), it seems unlikely that Pennsylvania would be able to organize and conduct such a referendum. Probability estimate for this component: 0.15 (b) Tennessee enacting stricter abortion regulations by July 2024: Tennessee is a conservative state that has already enacted strict abortion laws. The state has a history of passing restrictive abortion legislation. There's ongoing pressure from conservative groups to further restrict abortion access. The Republican-controlled legislature and governor are likely to be receptive to such measures. However, Tennessee already has some of the strictest abortion laws in the country, which might limit the scope for further restrictions. Probability estimate for this component: 0.60 Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.15 + 0.60 - (0.15 * 0.60) = 0.75 - 0.09 = 0.66.

Current political climate in Indiana: Indiana is a predominantly conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature and governor's office. Historically, the state has been more likely to restrict abortion rights rather than protect them. 2. Recent legislation: In August 2022, Indiana passed a near-total abortion ban, which was later blocked by the courts. This suggests that the current political leadership is not inclined towards protecting abortion rights. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a referendum by August 2024, which is just over a year away. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that typically requires significant lead time for planning, approval, and implementation. 4. Lack of current initiatives: As of now, there are no widely reported initiatives or movements in Indiana pushing for a referendum on abortion rights protection. 5. National trends: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights (e.g., Kansas, Michigan), these have typically been in response to attempts to restrict abortion rights, not to proactively protect them. Indiana's political landscape makes it less likely to follow this trend. 6. Legal challenges: The current focus in Indiana seems to be on legal challenges to the abortion ban rather than pursuing a referendum. 7. Public opinion: While public opinion on abortion in Indiana is mixed, there isn't a strong, visible push for expanded abortion rights that would likely lead to a referendum. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Indiana will conduct a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. The state's conservative leanings, recent legislative actions, and the lack of any current movement towards such a referendum all point towards a very low probability of this occurring."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "5010937c-2af6-45e3-b3ef-4106f623da98", "title": "Will Colorado enact a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the state of Colorado enacts a new law that modifies or replaces the current restrictions on medical care for transgender youth.

Indiana conducting a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: The likelihood of this happening seems low. Indiana is a predominantly conservative state, and there hasn't been any significant movement or public discussion about holding such a referendum. Typically, referendums on contentious issues like abortion rights require substantial grassroots organizing and political will, which we haven't seen in Indiana. Moreover, the state recently passed restrictive abortion laws, suggesting that the current political climate is not favorable for an abortion rights referendum. 2. Colorado enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024: This scenario seems more plausible. Colorado has been progressive on LGBTQ+ rights, including transgender rights. In recent years, there has been increasing attention to transgender youth healthcare across the United States. While Colorado already has some protections in place for transgender individuals, it's conceivable that they might further refine or expand these laws, especially in response to restrictive measures in other states. However, it's important to note that as of now, Colorado is generally considered to have relatively progressive policies regarding transgender healthcare. The state already prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage for transition-related care and has laws protecting against discrimination based on gender identity. This means that while further modifications are possible, they may not be seen as urgently necessary compared to states with more restrictive policies. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of Colorado enacting such a law, but it's far from certain. The timeframe (by July 2024) provides ample opportunity for legislative action, but it also depends on political priorities and potential shifts in public opinion.

Scrutiny of AI: Given the increasing role of AI in information dissemination, there's likely to be heightened vigilance from election officials, media, and researchers regarding AI-generated content during the election period. 5. Complexity of election information: Elections involve complex and rapidly changing information, which could potentially lead to unintentional errors or misinterpretations by AI systems. 6. Definition of 'spreading misinformation': The question requires specific reports mentioning the AI assistant's role in spreading misinformation, not just isolated incidents or minor inaccuracies. 7. Multiple source requirement: The criteria for resolution require reports from at least two credible sources, which sets a higher bar for confirmation. Considering these factors, I believe there's a relatively low, but not negligible, chance of this event occurring. Google is likely to be extremely cautious with its AI assistant during an election period, but the complexity of election information and the evolving nature of AI technology leave room for potential issues.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that either Mexico or the Philippines will become a full member of BRICS by August 2024.

Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely but not impossible for Stanford to implement this policy by July 2024. The main reasons for skepticism are the very short timeframe and the lack of any recent announcements or hints about such a change. However, Stanford does have the financial capacity to make this change, and it would align with broader trends in higher education. If Stanford were planning such a change for the 2024-2025 academic year, they would likely have announced it already to attract applicants. The lack of such an announcement makes it improbable that this policy will be in place by July 2024.

As of 2023, Stanford covers tuition for students from families earning less than $75,000 per year. Expanding this to $100,000 is a relatively small step.

Additionally, state-wide educational initiatives typically require significant planning, budgeting, and legislative processes, which are unlikely to be completed in such a short timeframe (again, only about a month from the creation date to the resolution date).

AI chatbots and misinformation: AI chatbots, including large language models, have been known to sometimes generate false or misleading information. Grok, being a relatively new AI chatbot, may be prone to such issues. 3. AI-driven trends: Twitter's (now X's) AI-driven trends have faced criticism in the past for potentially amplifying misinformation. The algorithm's susceptibility to manipulation or unintended bias could lead to the spread of election misinformation. 4.

AI chatbot Grok: Grok is a relatively new AI chatbot, launched by X (formerly Twitter) in late 2023. It's designed to have a more provocative and less filtered approach compared to other AI chatbots. This design philosophy increases the risk of spreading misinformation. 3. Twitter's AI-driven trends: Twitter (now X) has a history of being a platform where misinformation can spread rapidly. AI-driven trends might amplify this issue by potentially promoting controversial or misleading content. 4. Past incidents: Social media platforms, including Twitter, have been implicated in spreading election misinformation in previous elections. AI systems have been known to generate and spread misinformation in various contexts. 5. Scrutiny and monitoring: Given the importance of elections and the increasing awareness of AI's potential impact, there will likely be heightened scrutiny of AI systems like Grok and AI-driven trends during the election period. Many organizations, including election officials, news outlets, and researchers, will be actively monitoring for misinformation. 6. Credibility threshold: The question requires credible reports from at least two reputable sources, which sets a reasonably high bar for resolution. 7. Preventive measures: X/Twitter and other tech companies are likely aware of these risks and may implement measures to prevent or mitigate the spread of election misinformation. However, the effectiveness of these measures is uncertain, especially for new systems like Grok. Considering these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that either Grok or Twitter's AI-driven trends will be reported for spreading election misinformation.

National trends: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights following the Roe v. Wade decision, these have primarily been in more liberal or swing states. Conservative states like Alabama have generally not shown interest in such referendums. 6. Legal challenges: Any attempt to hold a referendum on abortion rights in Alabama would likely face legal challenges from anti-abortion groups, potentially delaying or preventing the process. 7. Public opinion: While national polls show a majority of Americans support some level of abortion rights, Alabama's population tends to be more conservative on this issue, reducing the likelihood of a push for a referendum. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Alabama would hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024. The state's political climate, existing laws, and the short time frame make it improbable that such a referendum would be organized, approved, and conducted within the given period."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "01ca9561-e3a0-4f6c-a740-6634fe85c95c", "title": "Will both of the following occur by July 2024: (a) Texas enacts new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers, and (b) Alabama holds a referendum on abortion rights?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, both of the following conditions are met: (a) Texas enacts new laws or regulations that impose stricter requirements on abortion providers compared to other healthcare providers.

Let's analyze each condition separately: a) Texas enacting new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers: Texas has a history of implementing strict abortion laws. In 2021, they passed SB 8, one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Given this precedent and the state's conservative leadership, it's quite possible that Texas would enact new, stricter regulations on abortion providers. However, the timeframe is relatively short (about 13 months from the question's creation date), which might limit the likelihood of new legislation being passed and enacted. Still, given Texas's track record, this condition has a moderate to high probability of occurring. b) Alabama holding a referendum on abortion rights: This condition is less likely to occur. While Alabama has also been known for its strict abortion laws, holding a statewide referendum on abortion rights is a significant undertaking that requires considerable planning and political will. As of now, there are no widely reported plans for such a referendum in Alabama. Moreover, referendums on contentious issues like abortion rights are relatively rare, especially in conservative states where the legislature tends to make such decisions. The short timeframe (about 13 months) further reduces the likelihood of this occurring, as organizing a referendum typically requires more time for planning, approval, and execution. Considering both conditions together: For this question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. While the first condition (Texas enacting stricter abortion regulations) is reasonably likely, the second condition (Alabama holding a referendum) is much less likely.

Part A: Texas enacting stricter abortion regulations - Texas has a history of implementing strict abortion laws, including the 'heartbeat bill' in 2021. The current political climate in Texas is strongly conservative and anti-abortion. There's ongoing pressure from pro-life groups to further restrict abortion access. However, the timeframe is relatively short (about a month), which limits the likelihood of new legislation being passed and enacted. Additionally, Texas already has some of the strictest abortion laws in the country, potentially leaving less room for further restrictions. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of this part occurring as relatively low, around 20%. Part B: Alabama holding a referendum on abortion rights - Alabama has also been historically conservative on abortion issues. However, holding a statewide referendum is a significant undertaking that typically requires extensive planning and preparation. There have been no recent reports or indications of Alabama planning such a referendum. The timeframe (about a month) is extremely short for organizing and conducting a statewide referendum. Referendums on contentious issues like abortion rights are relatively rare and usually require substantial public debate and legislative action beforehand.

As environmental concerns and energy efficiency become increasingly important in the tech industry, it's plausible that Alibaba might announce such measures. However, the timeframe is relatively short (about a month from the question's creation date), which reduces the likelihood. Additionally, while energy efficiency is a concern in AI, it's not clear if Alibaba has publicly expressed specific concerns about this issue. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 20%. b) New York holding a referendum on climate change policies by August 2024: New York is known for being proactive on climate change issues. However, organizing a state-wide referendum is a significant undertaking that typically requires long-term planning. The timeframe given (about two months from the question's creation date) is extremely short for such a process. Moreover, referendums are not a common method for policy-making in New York State. While climate change is an important issue, it's more likely that policies would be implemented through legislative processes rather than a public referendum.

Their strong market position and growing international presence could contribute to continued growth. 3. EV market trends: The global EV market is expected to continue growing rapidly, which could benefit BYD as a major player in this sector. 4. Competition: While BYD faces strong competition from both domestic and international automakers, their diverse product lineup and vertical integration (including battery production) give them a competitive edge. 5. Economic factors: Global economic conditions, including potential recessions or slowdowns, could impact consumer spending on vehicles. However, government incentives for EV adoption in many countries might mitigate this risk. 6. Supply chain considerations: The automotive industry has faced supply chain challenges, particularly with semiconductor shortages. BYD's vertical integration may help them navigate these issues better than some competitors. 7.

Government policies: The UK government has implemented various measures to support economic growth and mitigate the risk of recession. 7. Business and consumer confidence: These indicators have been mixed but not overwhelmingly negative, suggesting some resilience in the economy. 8. Labor market: The UK labor market has remained relatively strong, which can help support consumer spending and economic growth. Given these factors, while there are certainly challenges and risks to the UK economy, there are also signs of resilience and potential for growth. The relatively short time frame of the question also works in favor of avoiding a recession.

Given these factors, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic about GM's potential for significant profit growth. The company's strategic focus on EVs and cost management, combined with potential recovery from recent industry challenges, could lead to improved performance. However, economic uncertainties and the competitive nature of the automotive industry present significant challenges.

Recent abortion legislation: In 2019, Georgia passed a 'heartbeat bill' restricting abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, which was later blocked by federal courts. This indicates a tendency towards restricting rather than protecting abortion rights. 3. Referendum process in Georgia: Georgia does not have a process for citizen-initiated referendums. Any referendum would need to be approved by the state legislature, which is unlikely given the current political makeup. 4. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of August 2024, which is just over a year away. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that typically requires significant lead time. 5. National trends: While some states have moved to protect abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, these have primarily been Democrat-controlled states. 6. Public opinion: While there may be some public support for abortion rights in Georgia, it's not clear if this support is strong enough to compel the current government to hold a referendum. 7. Legal considerations: Given the recent Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, states have more latitude in regulating abortion. This reduces the likelihood of a Republican-controlled state government feeling pressured to hold a referendum on protecting abortion rights. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Georgia will hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. The current political leadership is not inclined towards expanding abortion rights, and there's no clear mechanism or motivation for them to initiate such a referendum.

(a) Georgia holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: Currently, there is no concrete evidence or announcement suggesting that Georgia is planning to hold such a referendum. Georgia is a traditionally conservative state, and its current political climate does not indicate a strong push for enshrining abortion rights. The state has recently implemented stricter abortion laws, which suggests that a referendum to protect abortion rights is unlikely in the near future. However, political landscapes can change rapidly, especially given the national debate on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The timeframe (by August 2024) allows for some possibility, but it remains low. (b) FTC announcing completion of a major pricing practices investigation by July 2024: This scenario seems more plausible. The FTC has been increasingly focused on consumer protection and antitrust issues, particularly in the tech sector. Investigations into pricing practices that use personal data are aligned with current regulatory trends and concerns about data privacy and algorithmic discrimination. The FTC typically conducts such investigations, and the timeframe (by July 2024) allows for a reasonable period for an investigation to be completed. However, these investigations can be complex and time-consuming, especially when involving multiple major companies. Combining these factors: The probability of the Georgia referendum is quite low, estimated at around 10%. The probability of the FTC investigation completion is higher, estimated at around 40%.

The probability of this part occurring is relatively high, perhaps around 70-75%. (b) PepsiCo reporting increased North American demand for Cracker Jack by July 2024: This is more challenging to predict. Cracker Jack is a legacy brand that has been around for over 100 years, but it's not one of PepsiCo's major focus areas. The snack market is highly competitive, and consumer preferences can change rapidly. PepsiCo doesn't typically break out Cracker Jack sales specifically in its reports, which makes it harder to track. Additionally, there's no recent news suggesting a particular push or revitalization of the Cracker Jack brand. Given these factors, the probability of PepsiCo reporting an increase in North American demand for Cracker Jack is lower, perhaps around 30-35%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.725 (midpoint of 70-75%) * 0.325 (midpoint of 30-35%) \u2248 0.236. This calculation assumes the events are independent, which is a reasonable assumption given that mortgage rates and Cracker Jack demand are not directly related."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "2fa66522-f3f4-4570-97b6-cb7778a7a046", "title": "Will either the average rate on a 15-year mortgage exceed 5.5% by August 2024 or PepsiCo report increased North American demand for its Cracker Jack brand by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) At any point during August 2024, the average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, as reported by Freddie Mac in its Primary Mortgage Market Survey, exceeds 5.5%.

While there's a possibility of rates decreasing due to potential economic slowdowns or policy changes, the overall trend has been upward in recent years. The Federal Reserve has been combating inflation, which could lead to continued higher interest rates. Given the current rate and the trend, there's a significant chance that rates will remain above 5.5% by August 2024. 2. PepsiCo reporting increased North American demand for Cracker Jack by July 2024: Cracker Jack is a relatively small brand within PepsiCo's vast portfolio. While it's an iconic product, it's not typically a major focus in earnings reports. The snack market is highly competitive, and consumer preferences can shift quickly. However, PepsiCo has been investing in its snack brands, and there's always a possibility of marketing campaigns or product innovations boosting demand. The timeframe (over a year) also allows for potential positive changes. Combining these factors: - The mortgage rate condition seems more likely to occur, given current trends and economic factors. - The Cracker Jack condition is less certain but still possible. Since only one of these conditions needs to be met for a YES resolution, the overall probability is higher than either individual probability. The mortgage rate condition provides a strong base probability, while the Cracker Jack condition adds a smaller but non-negligible chance."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.041732096173448446, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.010433024043362112, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2904250008601574, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The index has never reached 3,500 points before, which makes this a significant milestone. Current level: As of June 2023, the KOSPI is trading around 2,600 points.

The ongoing global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and potential recessions in major economies, could pose challenges.

The performance of this sector, which has been volatile recently, will be crucial. Geopolitical factors: Tensions with North Korea and global trade disputes could impact market sentiment.

Economic context: The UK is currently facing economic challenges, including high inflation and slow growth. This could potentially lead to debates about economic reform. 5. Constitutional norms: The Salisbury Convention suggests that the House of Lords should not oppose the second or third reading of any government legislation promised in its election manifesto. 6. Recent precedents: There have been instances where the Lords have challenged the government on economic matters (e.g., tax credit cuts in 2015), but outright passing a major economic reform bill opposed by the government is rare. 7. Political consequences: Such an action by the Lords would likely trigger a constitutional crisis and potentially lead to reforms of the House of Lords itself. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the House of Lords would pass a major economic reform bill explicitly opposed by Prime Minister Sunak. The Lords may amend or delay economic legislation, but passing a major bill against the government's wishes would be an extraordinary event. However, it's not entirely impossible. The ongoing economic challenges and potential political shifts (such as a change in public opinion or internal party conflicts) could lead to increased tensions between the government and the Lords.

If inflation shows signs of cooling down by early 2024, it could pave the way for rate cuts. 3. Economic growth: The UK economy has been struggling with slow growth. If this persists or worsens, it could pressure the BoE to cut rates to stimulate the economy. 4. Global economic trends: Global economic conditions and actions by other major central banks (e.g., the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank) can influence the BoE's decisions. 5. Time frame: The question allows for an announcement by August 2024, which is more than a year away from the current date. This extended period increases the likelihood of economic conditions changing sufficiently to warrant a rate cut. 6. Historical precedent: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates after a tightening cycle unless there's a significant economic downturn or rapid disinflation. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The extended time frame allows for potential changes in economic conditions, but the BoE will likely be cautious about cutting rates too soon after a period of tightening.

However, declaring an outbreak \"over\" typically requires a period of no new cases, often twice the maximum incubation period. For Nipah, this could be around 42 days (given a maximum incubation period of 21 days). Given that the resolution date is August 31, 2024, and the question was created on June 30, 2024, there's a considerable amount of time (about 2 months) for the outbreak to be controlled and declared over. This timeframe is generally sufficient for containing a Nipah outbreak, assuming it doesn't spread widely. b) Mpox outbreak in the Central African Republic: Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) outbreaks can last several months, but are generally controllable with proper public health measures. The Central African Republic, however, faces challenges in healthcare infrastructure that could prolong the outbreak. The resolution date for this part is earlier (July 31, 2024), giving less time for control measures to take effect. Additionally, declaring an outbreak over typically requires no new cases for a certain period, often 42 days for mpox. Considering both conditions: 1. The Nipah virus condition has a higher likelihood of being met due to the longer timeframe and typically shorter duration of outbreaks. 2. The mpox condition is less certain due to the shorter timeframe and potential healthcare challenges in the Central African Republic. For both conditions to be met, we need both outbreaks to be controlled relatively quickly.

Outbreaks are typically localized and don't tend to spread globally. The WHO usually declares outbreaks over when there have been no new cases for a certain period, typically twice the incubation period of the virus. The Nipah virus has an incubation period of 4-14 days, so the outbreak would likely be declared over after about 28-56 days without new cases. Given that we have until August 31, 2024 (about 14 months from the question's creation date), there's a good chance that any current outbreak could be contained and declared over within this timeframe. However, the question specifies that this refers to an outbreak that 'prompted heightened public health responses globally.' As of mid-2023, there isn't a global Nipah virus outbreak of this scale, so this part of the question seems to be anticipating a potential future outbreak. If such an outbreak were to occur, it would need to start and end within the given timeframe, which reduces the probability somewhat. b) Mpox outbreak in the Central African Republic: Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) outbreaks can last for several months, but they are usually containable with proper public health measures. The Central African Republic, like many countries in the region, has experience dealing with mpox outbreaks. The resolution date for this part is July 31, 2024, which is about 13 months from the question's creation date. This provides a substantial amount of time for an outbreak to be controlled and declared over. However, it's worth noting that healthcare infrastructure in the Central African Republic is limited, which could potentially prolong an outbreak. Additionally, as of mid-2023, there isn't a widely reported ongoing mpox outbreak in the Central African Republic, so this part of the question also seems to be anticipating a potential future outbreak. Combining the probabilities: For the question to resolve as YES, only one of these events needs to occur. This increases the overall probability. However, both events are somewhat speculative, as they're based on potential future outbreaks rather than currently ongoing situations. Given the timeframes involved and the nature of these diseases, I would estimate there's a moderate chance of at least one of these events occurring."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.08377723269493764, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.02094430817373441, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4285987635479254, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current economic conditions: As of mid-2023, the UK is facing high inflation rates, which has led the Bank of England to raise interest rates to combat inflation. The Bank Rate currently stands at 5%, the highest level in 15 years. 2. Inflation outlook: The Bank of England's primary mandate is to maintain price stability, targeting a 2% inflation rate. If inflation shows signs of cooling down significantly by early to mid-2024, it could pave the way for rate cuts. 3. Economic growth: The UK economy has been experiencing slow growth. If economic conditions worsen or a recession occurs, the Bank might be more inclined to cut rates to stimulate the economy. 4. Global economic trends: Global economic conditions and actions by other major central banks (e.g., the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank) can influence the Bank of England's decisions. 5. Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut announcement by August 2024, which is about 14 months from the current date. This provides a relatively long window for economic conditions to change. 6. Historical precedent: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates after a tightening cycle unless there's a significant economic downturn or rapid disinflation. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The Bank of England will likely want to see sustained evidence of inflation moving towards its 2% target before considering rate cuts. However, if inflation does come down significantly and economic growth remains weak, there could be pressure to cut rates to support the economy. The time frame of 14 months provides enough time for economic conditions to evolve, potentially allowing for a shift in monetary policy. However, it's also possible that inflation could remain stubborn, or that the Bank might want to keep rates elevated for longer to ensure inflation is truly under control. Considering all these factors, I estimate there's a moderate probability of a rate cut announcement by August 2024, but it's far from certain."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "59fc1dba-6bf3-475e-8473-5c27c9225b37", "title": "Will India eliminate export taxes on agricultural products by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the Indian government officially announces or implements a policy to completely eliminate export taxes on agricultural products.

Bank of England interest rate cut by August 2024: The Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates depends on various economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic conditions. As of now (June 2023), the UK is experiencing high inflation, which has led to interest rate hikes. For a rate cut to occur by August 2024, we would need to see a significant improvement in inflation and potentially some economic slowdown warranting monetary easing. Given the current economic climate and the time frame (about 14 months from now), it's possible but not highly likely that the Bank of England will announce a rate cut by August 2024. The probability of this occurring might be around 40%. 2. India eliminating export taxes on agricultural products by July 2024: India has a history of using export taxes and bans on agricultural products to control domestic prices and ensure food security. The country has recently imposed export restrictions on wheat and sugar. Completely eliminating all export taxes on agricultural products would be a significant policy shift. While India might reduce some export taxes in response to changing economic conditions or international pressure, a complete elimination of all agricultural export taxes by July 2024 seems unlikely.

As of now (June 2023), the Bank Rate is at 5%. While there are expectations that interest rates might peak soon, a cut by August 2024 is not certain. The economic situation could change, but current projections suggest that inflation might still be above the target by mid-2024. However, if economic growth slows significantly or if inflation falls faster than expected, a rate cut could be possible. Given the uncertainty and the relatively short timeframe, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. b) India eliminating export taxes on agricultural products by July 2024: India has a history of using export taxes on agricultural products to manage domestic food prices and supply. These taxes are often adjusted based on domestic needs and global market conditions. Complete elimination of all such taxes by July 2024 seems unlikely for several reasons: 1. Food security is a major concern for India, and the government often uses export taxes as a tool to ensure adequate domestic supply. 2. Agricultural export taxes are a source of revenue for the government. 3. Global food prices and domestic production can be unpredictable, and the government may want to retain the flexibility to impose taxes if needed. However, there's a possibility that India might consider such a move if domestic production is exceptionally high or if there's significant pressure from trading partners. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 20%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs.

Current trends: As of late 2023, India's inflation has been moderating, but remains volatile due to factors like food prices and global economic conditions.

Nvidia's market position: As a leading provider of AI hardware and software, Nvidia is likely to be at the forefront of addressing AI-related challenges, including energy consumption. 3. Time frame: The question gives a relatively short timeframe (about a month) for Nvidia to make this announcement, which reduces the likelihood. 4. Nvidia's past behavior: Nvidia has shown interest in energy efficiency in the past, but has not made major announcements specifically about AI energy consumption reduction. 5. Regulatory environment: There's increasing regulatory pressure on tech companies to address environmental concerns, which could motivate such an announcement. 6. Competitive landscape: Other tech giants like Google and Microsoft have made commitments to reduce their AI-related carbon footprint, which might pressure Nvidia to follow suit. 7. Technical feasibility: Nvidia has the technical expertise to develop more energy-efficient AI solutions, making such an announcement plausible. 8. Public relations: Such an announcement could be good for Nvidia's public image and align with growing consumer concern about environmental issues. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Nvidia will make such an announcement. The short timeframe is the main factor reducing the probability. However, the growing industry trend, Nvidia's market position, and potential PR benefits increase the likelihood."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "0570952f-e2b7-4026-9305-a26daf653bdf", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Elon Musk conduct a live interview with Satya Nadella on X by August 2024 and (b) Nvidia announce measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if both of the following events occur:\n\n(a) Elon Musk conducts a live interview with Satya Nadella on X (formerly known as Twitter) by August 31, 2024.

Factors to consider: Inflation trends: If inflation starts to decrease significantly, it could prompt a rate cut. Economic growth: A slowdown or recession in the Eurozone could push the ECB towards easing monetary policy. Global economic conditions: Changes in other major economies could influence ECB decisions.

(a) European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate cut: As of now (June 2023), the ECB has been raising interest rates to combat inflation. However, by July 2024, the economic landscape could change significantly. Factors to consider: 1. Inflation trends: If inflation shows signs of cooling down, the ECB might consider rate cuts. 2. Economic growth: If the Eurozone faces a recession or significant slowdown, it could prompt rate cuts. 3. Global economic conditions: Changes in major economies like the US or China could influence ECB decisions. 4. Historical patterns: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates after a tightening cycle. Given these factors, while a rate cut is possible, it's not highly likely within the given timeframe. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. (b) Hyundai Motor Company workers' strike resolution: Several factors to consider: 1. Frequency of strikes: The automotive industry, including Hyundai, has a history of labor disputes. 2. Duration of the question: The timeframe (about 13 months) provides ample opportunity for a strike to occur and be resolved. 3. Economic pressures: Global economic conditions might push both management and workers towards quicker resolutions. 4. Past behavior: Hyundai has shown ability to resolve strikes in the past. Given these factors, the likelihood of a significant strike occurring and being resolved within this timeframe seems moderately high. I'd estimate the probability at around 60%. Combining probabilities: The question resolves YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.30 + 0.60 - (0.30 * 0.60) = 0.90 - 0.18 = 0.72.

External factors: The global economic outlook for 2023-2024 is uncertain, with concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential slowdowns in major economies like the U.S. and China. However, Mexico's strong ties to the U.S. economy could be beneficial if the U.S. avoids a recession. 4. Domestic policies: The Mexican government has been implementing policies to attract foreign investment and boost domestic consumption, which could help sustain economic growth. 5.

SEC climate disclosure rule reinstatement by July 2024: The SEC's climate disclosure rule was blocked by a court decision, which indicates there are significant legal challenges to overcome. Reinstating such a rule typically involves a complex legal process, including appeals and potentially new rulemaking. Given the short timeframe (about a year from now) and the current political climate surrounding environmental regulations, it seems challenging to achieve reinstatement by July 2024.

Historically, the NASDAQ has shown the potential for such growth over a year, especially considering the current bullish trends in tech stocks and AI-related companies. However, economic uncertainties, potential interest rate changes, and global events could impact market performance. Given the longer timeframe (until August 2024) and the current market momentum, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%.

Its blockage by a court decision was a setback, but given the current administration's focus on climate issues, there's likely to be a strong push to reinstate it. However, legal processes can be slow and unpredictable. The timeline (by July 31, 2024) gives about a year for this to happen, which is a reasonable timeframe for legal appeals or new regulatory approaches.

However, market performance is subject to many factors including economic conditions, interest rates, and global events. The tech sector has been volatile, and there are concerns about overvaluation. Still, given the longer timeframe and only needing to reach this level intraday (not close at it), I'd estimate the probability at around 60%. Combining probabilities: Since we only need one of these events to occur for a YES resolution, we can use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

In recent years, there have been efforts to crack down on these platforms. However, a complete shutdown of 50% of known Chinese-run online trading platforms is a significant action that would require substantial political will and enforcement capacity.

Mexican authorities declaring the dismantling of La Familia Michoacana cartel by July 2024: Drug cartels in Mexico have proven to be resilient and difficult to completely dismantle. While Mexican authorities have had some successes in arresting cartel leaders and disrupting operations, fully dismantling a cartel is a complex and time-consuming process. La Familia Michoacana, while not as prominent as some other cartels, still maintains a significant presence. Given the short timeline and the historical difficulty in eradicating cartels, I would estimate the probability of this occurring at around 20%. To calculate the overall probability, we need to consider the probability of at least one of these events occurring. The probability of neither event occurring is (1 - 0.6) * (1 - 0.2) = 0.32.

Inflation trends: If inflation shows signs of cooling down by mid-2024, it could provide room for the central bank to consider rate cuts. 3. Global economic trends: The actions of major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, can influence Israel's monetary policy decisions. 4.

Historical context: The UK has a history of protests related to healthcare issues, particularly concerning the National Health Service (NHS).

Current state of UK healthcare: The NHS is already under significant strain due to factors such as an aging population, increasing demand, and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any further cuts to healthcare funding would likely be met with strong opposition. 3. Political climate: The UK government has been facing criticism for its handling of various issues, including healthcare. This could make the public more prone to protest against perceived negative policy decisions. 4. Economic factors: If the UK is experiencing economic difficulties, the government might be more likely to implement spending cuts, including in healthcare. This could increase the likelihood of protests. 5. Time frame: The question allows for a full year (from July 2023 to July 2024) for these protests to occur, which is a significant amount of time for opposition to build and organize if cuts are announced. 6. Protest threshold: The criteria for a \"large\" protest (1,000 participants) is relatively low, making it easier for a protest to qualify. 7. Media coverage: The requirement for coverage by two major international news outlets is likely to be met if a significant protest occurs, given the global interest in UK politics and healthcare issues. Given these factors, I believe there is a high likelihood of large protests occurring if healthcare funding cuts are announced. The NHS is a deeply valued institution in the UK, and any perceived threat to it typically generates strong public reaction. The relatively low threshold for what constitutes a \"large\" protest and the extended time frame further increase the probability. However, there are a few factors that slightly reduce the probability: 1. The question doesn't specify whether healthcare funding cuts have been announced or are planned. If no such cuts are proposed, protests won't occur. 2. The government might be aware of the potential for protests and could avoid making significant cuts to healthcare funding. 3.

The timeframe given (by July 2024) is about a year away, which is a considerable amount of time for economic conditions to change.

Current trend: As of June 2023, U.S. weekly jobless claims have been consistently below 200,000 for several months, indicating a strong labor market. 2. Historical context: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, weekly jobless claims above 200,000 were relatively rare. The last time claims consistently exceeded 200,000 (excluding the pandemic period) was during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. 3. Economic outlook: While there are concerns about a potential recession, most economists predict a mild slowdown rather than a severe downturn in the near future. 4. Federal Reserve actions: The Fed has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could lead to some cooling in the job market. However, their approach has been gradual to avoid causing significant job losses. 5. Structural changes in the labor market: The tight labor market and ongoing skills shortages in certain sectors may make employers more reluctant to lay off workers, even in a mild downturn. 6. Time frame: The question allows for this scenario to occur any time until August 2024, which is over a year away. This extended period increases the chances of economic fluctuations that could lead to higher jobless claims. 7. Potential external shocks: Unforeseen events (e.g., geopolitical crises, natural disasters) could disrupt the economy and lead to increased unemployment. Given these factors, while it's certainly possible for weekly jobless claims to exceed 200,000 for four consecutive weeks by August 2024, it would require a significant deterioration in the labor market from its current strong position. The gradual approach of the Federal Reserve and the structural tightness in the labor market make this scenario less likely in the short term.

Consumer snacking habits tend to be relatively stable, but can be influenced by economic conditions and marketing efforts. The timeframe (by July 2024) gives PepsiCo over a year to potentially see and report an increase in demand.

Tostitos is a popular brand in their snack portfolio. The snack food industry generally shows resilience even during economic downturns. However, there are several factors to consider: The comparison is against Q2 2023, which might have been a strong quarter. Economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can change. Health trends might impact snack food consumption. Competition in the snack food market is intense. Given these factors, I'd estimate a moderate chance of about 60% for this condition being met. b) U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 200,000 for four consecutive weeks by August 2024: This condition depends on the state of the U.S. economy over the next year. Current economic indicators show: The job market has been relatively strong, with unemployment rates low. However, there are concerns about potential economic slowdowns or recessions. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions could impact job markets. Global economic factors and geopolitical events could influence U.S. job markets. Weekly jobless claims exceeding 200,000 for four consecutive weeks would indicate a significant deterioration in the job market. While this is possible, it's not highly probable given current conditions. I'd estimate about a 40% chance of this occurring. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either condition is met. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.60 + 0.40 - (0.60 * 0.40) = 1 - (0.40 * 0.60) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76.

Union priorities: The UFCW represents workers in industries such as retail, food processing, and healthcare. They are likely to endorse a candidate who supports policies beneficial to their members, such as worker protections, fair wages, and healthcare reform. 5. Potential challenges: There could be internal debates within the union about the timing or choice of endorsement, especially if there are multiple strong candidates or if members have diverse political views. 6. Recent trends: In recent years, some unions have been more cautious about early endorsements, preferring to wait and see how candidates' platforms develop. However, with an incumbent president who has been generally supportive of labor, this may be less of a concern. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that the UFCW will endorse a candidate by July 2024. They have a history of political engagement, and the timing aligns well with the election cycle.

The ongoing debate about student loan debt in the U.S. political landscape. 3. Potential economic challenges that could necessitate such relief. This event seems more likely than the RBA rate cut, given the political climate and ongoing discussions about student loan debt in the U.S. For both events to occur, we need them to happen independently.

As of June 2023, the cash rate target is 4.10%. Given the current global economic conditions and the RBA's recent stance, it seems unlikely that they would cut rates in the near future. However, economic conditions can change rapidly, and a year is a long time in economic terms. If inflation starts to cool significantly or if there's an economic downturn, the RBA might consider cutting rates. Still, the probability seems low given the current trajectory. b) U.S. Education Department student loan payment holiday plan: The U.S. has a history of implementing student loan relief measures, including payment pauses during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Supreme Court recently struck down President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. While this doesn't directly affect payment holidays, it does indicate a challenging environment for broad student loan relief measures. That said, the Biden administration has shown a strong commitment to addressing student loan issues and might seek alternative ways to provide relief, including payment holidays. The probability of this happening seems moderate. Combining these factors: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs, which increases the overall probability. Even if each individual event has a relatively low probability, the combination of two possibilities makes a YES resolution more likely. Given the longer timeframe (until July 2024), the ongoing discussions around student loan relief in the U.S., and the possibility of changing economic conditions that might necessitate an RBA rate cut, I would estimate a moderate probability for this question resolving as YES."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.10431106086050446, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.026077765215126114, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4615726027865416, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The question specifically mentions that if the plan is blocked by legal challenges, it would resolve as NO. This is a significant risk factor. 4.

National trends: While some states have been moving to restrict abortion rights, others have been working to protect them.

There's significant political pressure to provide some form of relief to student loan borrowers. However, implementing a new plan that can withstand legal challenges is complex and time-consuming.

In January 2022, Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill codifying abortion rights into state law. However, enshrining these rights in the state constitution would provide even stronger protections. There has been discussion about such a referendum, but as of the question's creation date (June 2024), no concrete plans have been announced for a July 2024 referendum. Organizing a statewide referendum typically requires significant lead time for planning, public awareness, and logistical arrangements. The extremely short timeframe between the question's creation and resolution makes it highly unlikely that New Jersey could organize and conduct such a referendum within a month. Considering both scenarios, the probability of either occurring by July 2024 is quite low.

Given these factors, it seems highly likely that the SEIU will endorse a candidate by July 2024. The union has a strong interest in influencing the election outcome and mobilizing its members early. The late July deadline provides ample time for the union to make a decision, even if there were some initial hesitations or strategic delays."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "626e9ee4-1611-44a3-882e-17b417511a9a", "title": "Will Washington implement a free community college plan by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, Washington has officially implemented a free community college plan.

They typically endorse candidates in presidential elections, and their endorsement can be significant. Given that the 2024 presidential election will be in full swing by July 2024, it's highly likely that the SEIU will have made an endorsement by then. They usually endorse Democratic candidates, and with the incumbent President Joe Biden likely running for re-election, there's a strong chance they will endorse him or another Democratic nominee well before July 2024. b) Washington implementing a free community college plan: This is more uncertain. While there has been a growing movement across the United States to make community college more accessible and affordable, implementing a state-wide free community college plan is a significant undertaking that requires substantial legislative and budgetary changes. As of my last update, Washington state had not yet implemented such a plan, although there have been discussions and proposals around increasing access to higher education. Several factors make this less likely to occur by July 2024: 1. The timeline is relatively short for such a major policy change. 2. It would require significant funding, which might be challenging given other state priorities and potential budget constraints. 3. There might be political opposition or debate that could delay implementation. 4. The COVID-19 pandemic has strained many state budgets, potentially making it harder to fund new initiatives. However, it's not impossible. Washington is generally considered a progressive state, and there is growing national momentum for such initiatives. If there's strong political will and available funding, it could happen. Given these factors, I believe it's likely that the SEIU will endorse a presidential candidate by July 2024, but less likely that Washington will implement a free community college plan by that time.

The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is before the typical time for party conventions (usually held in August or September). While it's possible for the SEIU to make an early endorsement, especially if there's a clear frontrunner, they might also wait until after the conventions to make their official endorsement. b) Washington's free community college plan: Washington state has been progressive in terms of education policies, and there have been discussions about implementing a free community college plan. However, implementing such a significant policy change by July 2024 would require substantial legislative action and funding allocation. While it's possible, it's not highly probable given the short timeframe and the complexity of implementing such a program statewide.

Apple finalizing a union contract with New York store employees by July 2024: This scenario is more plausible, but still faces significant challenges. In June 2022, employees at an Apple store in Towson, Maryland, voted to unionize, becoming the first Apple retail store in the U.S. to do so. Since then, there have been efforts to unionize other Apple stores, including in New York. However, Apple has been resistant to these efforts, employing various tactics to discourage unionization. That said, the labor movement has been gaining momentum in recent years, particularly in the tech sector. The National Labor Relations Board has also been more supportive of union efforts under the current administration. If employees at a New York Apple store successfully unionize, negotiating and finalizing a contract by July 2024 is possible, though it would likely be a challenging and potentially lengthy process. Given these factors, I would assign a higher probability to the Apple unionization scenario than the Tennessee referendum scenario, but both are still relatively unlikely. Considering both scenarios together, and the fact that only one needs to occur for a YES resolution, I would estimate the probability as follows: Probability: 0.15.

The state has a history of regularly increasing its minimum wage to keep up with inflation. Given this trend, it's highly likely that the minimum wage will reach or exceed $16 per hour by July 2024.

Predicting mortgage rates over a year in advance is challenging due to various economic factors. However, considering current trends and the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation, it's plausible that rates could exceed 7.0% by August 2024. The Fed's actions, potential economic uncertainties, and inflationary pressures could push rates higher. However, there's also a possibility of economic stabilization or even a recession, which could keep rates lower.

Given the state's history of increasing minimum wages and the current proximity to $16/hour, it's highly likely that the minimum wage for fast food workers will be at least $16/hour by July 2024.

Mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including Federal Reserve policies, inflation, and economic conditions. The Fed has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, and while there's expectation that rate hikes might slow down, it's uncertain whether they will reverse course by 2024.

This history might make the RBI more vigilant about the bank's operations. 2. Current financial health: As of 2023, Yes Bank has shown signs of improvement in its financial performance. However, we would need to closely monitor its asset quality, capital adequacy, and overall stability leading up to August 2024. 3.

Historical precedent: The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has a history of securing large funding commitments for various initiatives.

Timeframe: The question gives a relatively short timeframe of about one month (from the creation date to the resolution date).

Global economic conditions: The current global economic situation, including inflation and potential recession fears in some countries, might make it more challenging to secure large funding commitments. 4. Urgent global issues: On the other hand, ongoing food security challenges, climate change impacts on agriculture, and the need for sustainable food systems might drive increased funding commitments. 5. FAO's current initiatives: The likelihood of this event depends on whether the FAO has any major initiatives or programs in the pipeline that could attract significant funding. 6. Donor landscape: The willingness and ability of major donors (countries, organizations, or private entities) to make large commitments in this timeframe is crucial. 7. Specificity of the criteria: The question requires new initiatives or significant expansions, not continuations of existing commitments. This narrows the possibilities. 8. Verification requirement: The announcement must be reported by at least two reputable news sources, which adds an extra layer of confirmation but shouldn't be a significant barrier if such a large commitment is made. Given these factors, I believe the probability is relatively low. The short timeframe is a significant limiting factor, as securing and announcing such a large commitment typically requires more time for negotiation and preparation. Additionally, the requirement for new initiatives or significant expansions, rather than continuations of existing programs, further reduces the likelihood. However, it's not impossible. The FAO might have been working on securing such funding for some time, and the announcement could coincide with this timeframe.

However, since then, the bank has shown signs of recovery and stability. The RBI has been actively monitoring the banking sector, and while it's possible they might impose new regulations, targeting a specific bank like Yes Bank with new curbs seems less likely unless there are clear signs of trouble.

The extended time frame allows for potential changes in economic conditions that could necessitate a rate cut. However, this is not certain, as it depends on how economic conditions evolve both domestically and globally. The BOK is known for its cautious approach, and it would likely wait for clear signs of sustained economic weakness or significantly reduced inflation before cutting rates.

As of June 2023, their base rate stands at 3.50%. However, given the global economic uncertainties and potential slowdown, there's a possibility they might consider rate cuts in the coming year. The timeline until August 2024 provides a considerable window for economic conditions to change. If global inflation trends downward and growth concerns become more prominent, the Bank of Korea might be inclined to cut rates to stimulate the economy. b) U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 275,000 for two consecutive weeks: As of June 2023, U.S. weekly jobless claims have been hovering around 220,000-230,000. The threshold of 275,000 for two consecutive weeks is significantly higher than current levels. However, there are growing concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. economy. Many economists predict a mild recession in late 2023 or early 2024. If this materializes, it could lead to increased layoffs and higher jobless claims. The timeline until August 2024 allows for economic conditions to deteriorate sufficiently to reach this threshold. Considering both conditions: 1. The Bank of Korea reducing rates seems moderately likely given the potential for global economic slowdown and the extended timeline. 2.

Historical trends: Without specific data on Washington's Medicaid expansion, we can look at general trends in other states. Medicaid expansion typically sees a surge in enrollment in the initial years, followed by slower growth. 4. Population of Washington: As of 2021, Washington's population was approximately 7.7 million. 450,000 enrollees would represent about 5.8% of the state's population, which is a substantial number for Medicaid expansion. 5. Economic factors: Economic conditions, such as unemployment rates and income levels, can affect Medicaid enrollment.

These could include slow economic growth, high unemployment, or low inflation. 2. Global economic trends: The global economic situation by mid-2024 could influence the RBA's decision. If major economies are experiencing slowdowns or have already cut rates, it might pressure Australia to follow suit. 3. RBA's recent policy stance: The RBA's recent statements and decisions leading up to June 2024 would provide insight into their thinking. If they've been hinting at potential rate cuts or expressing concerns about economic headwinds, it increases the likelihood of a cut. 4. Inflation targets: If inflation is consistently below the RBA's target range (typically 2-3%), it could motivate a rate cut to stimulate economic activity and boost inflation. 5. Labor market conditions: High unemployment or underemployment could push the RBA towards a more accommodative monetary policy. 6. Housing market: The state of Australia's housing market, which is sensitive to interest rates, could influence the decision. 7.

Efficacy data: Clinical trials have shown that Leqembi can slow cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's patients, which is a significant factor for regulatory approval. 3. Safety profile: While the drug has shown promise, there have been concerns about side effects, particularly brain swelling and bleeding. However, these risks are being managed and monitored. 4. EMA review process: The EMA typically takes 12-18 months to review new drug applications. If Biogen submitted the application shortly after FDA approval, it could potentially be reviewed by July 2024. 5. Conditional marketing authorization: The EMA can grant conditional marketing authorization for drugs that address unmet medical needs, even if comprehensive clinical data is not yet available. This could work in Leqembi's favor given the limited treatment options for Alzheimer's. 6. Precedent: The EMA has previously approved another Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm (also developed by Biogen), albeit with limitations. This suggests openness to new Alzheimer's treatments. 7. Urgency: Given the high prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and the lack of effective treatments, there may be pressure to expedite the approval process. 8. Time frame: The question asks about approval by July 2024, which gives a reasonable window for the EMA to complete its review process. Considering these factors, I believe there is a good chance that Leqembi will receive conditional marketing approval from the EMA by July 2024.

It received accelerated approval from the FDA in January 2023 and full approval in July 2023. The EMA typically follows the FDA's lead, but with a delay. Given that the EMA has already started its review process, and considering the usual timeline for EMA approvals, it's quite possible that Leqembi could receive conditional marketing approval by July 2024.

It received accelerated approval from the FDA in January 2023 and full approval in July 2023. This suggests that the drug has demonstrated efficacy and safety to some degree. The EMA typically follows the FDA's lead, but with a delay. Given that the FDA has already granted full approval, it's likely that the EMA will also approve the drug. However, the European approval process can be slower and more conservative. The deadline of July 31, 2024, gives more than a year from the FDA's full approval for the EMA to complete its review process. This timeframe seems reasonable for the EMA to make a decision, especially considering the drug's potential impact on Alzheimer's treatment. (b) Medicare's negotiated drug prices including a major diabetes medication by August 31, 2024: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 gave Medicare the authority to negotiate prices for certain high-cost prescription drugs. The first set of 10 drugs selected for price negotiation was announced in August 2023, and the negotiated prices for these drugs are set to take effect in 2026. Diabetes medications are often among the most expensive drugs and are widely used by Medicare beneficiaries. It's highly likely that major diabetes medications will be included in future rounds of price negotiations. However, the question specifies that the negotiated prices must be confirmed to take effect by August 31, 2024. This is earlier than the timeline set out in the current implementation of the Medicare drug price negotiation program, which has the first set of negotiated prices taking effect in 2026.

Existing legal framework: New York already has strong protections for abortion rights enshrined in state law. This might reduce the urgency for a referendum. 3. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of August 2024, which is about 14 months from now. This is a relatively short period to organize a statewide referendum, especially if it hasn't been widely discussed or proposed yet. 4. Legislative process: In New York, constitutional amendments (which a referendum on abortion rights would likely be) must pass both houses of the state legislature in two consecutive legislative sessions before going to a public vote. This process typically takes several years. 5. Recent events: The overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 has led many states to consider strengthening abortion protections. However, New York has not announced plans for a referendum on this issue. 6. Public opinion: While there is likely strong support for abortion rights in New York, there hasn't been a significant public push for a referendum on this specific issue. 7.

Time frame: The question is asking about a referendum by July 2024, which is just over a year away. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that typically requires significant lead time for planning, approval, and implementation. 3. Legislative process: In Georgia, constitutional amendments must first be approved by two-thirds of both chambers of the state legislature before being put to a public vote.

There doesn't appear to be overwhelming public pressure for such a referendum. 5. Recent precedent: There have been no recent indications or discussions from Georgia's political leadership about holding such a referendum. The state's focus has been on implementing and defending its restrictive abortion laws rather than expanding rights. 6.

Current political climate in both states: New York is a predominantly Democratic state with strong pro-choice leanings. The state has already taken steps to protect abortion rights, including passing the Reproductive Health Act in 2019. There's less urgency for a referendum in New York as abortion rights are already well-protected. Georgia, on the other hand, is a more conservative state that has recently passed restrictive abortion laws. There's more potential for political conflict over abortion rights in Georgia, which could potentially lead to a push for a referendum. 2. Legislative processes and timelines: Organizing a statewide referendum requires significant legislative action and planning. With the resolution date set for August 31, 2024, and the question being created on June 30, 2024, there's very little time for either state to plan and execute a referendum, especially considering the complex nature of the issue. 3. Historical precedent: Neither state has a recent history of holding referendums on abortion rights. This makes it less likely that they would suddenly decide to hold one, especially within such a short timeframe. 4. Political will and public demand: While abortion rights are a contentious issue, there's no indication of a strong push for referendums in either state at this time. Without significant public pressure or political motivation, it's unlikely that both states would independently decide to hold referendums on this issue within the given timeframe. 5. Logistical challenges: Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex and costly process. With the short notice (question created on June 30, 2024, for referendums to be held in July and August 2024), it would be extremely challenging for both states to overcome the logistical hurdles in time. 6. Simultaneous occurrence: The question requires both states to hold referendums, which further reduces the probability. Even if one state were to hold a referendum, the chances of both doing so independently are much lower. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that both New York and Georgia would hold referendums on abortion rights within the specified timeframe.

Let's examine each state separately: 1. New York: New York is generally considered a pro-choice state, with strong protections for abortion rights already in place. In 2019, the state passed the Reproductive Health Act, which codified Roe v. Wade protections into state law. Given this existing legal framework, there might be less urgency for a referendum specifically on abortion rights. However, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, there has been increased discussion about further strengthening abortion protections in various states. New York's legislature has been considering a state constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights, which would require a referendum. The process for amending the New York State Constitution is complex and time-consuming. It requires passage by two separately elected legislatures and then approval by voters in a referendum. While discussions are ongoing, the timeline to complete this process by August 31, 2024, is tight and would require significant political will and coordination. 2. Georgia: Georgia has more restrictive abortion laws compared to New York. In 2019, the state passed a \"heartbeat bill\" restricting abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, which was initially blocked but went into effect after the Dobbs decision in 2022. The political climate in Georgia is more conservative, and the current state government is generally opposed to expanding abortion rights. For a referendum on enshrining abortion rights to occur, it would likely require a significant shift in the political landscape or overwhelming public pressure. Georgia's process for amending the state constitution also requires approval by two-thirds of both chambers of the General Assembly and then a majority vote in a referendum. Given the current political makeup of Georgia's legislature, this seems highly unlikely to occur by July 31, 2024. Considering both states: - New York has a higher likelihood of holding such a referendum due to its more progressive stance on abortion rights and ongoing discussions about constitutional amendments. - Georgia has a very low probability of holding a referendum to enshrine abortion rights given its current political climate and recent history of restricting abortion access. While there is some possibility of a referendum occurring in New York, the tight timeline and complex process make it far from certain. The probability of a referendum in Georgia is even lower. This low probability reflects the significant challenges and unlikely scenarios required for either state to hold such a referendum within the specified timeframe. While not impossible, it would require a combination of political will, public pressure, and expedited processes that are not currently evident in either state."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 4.979150860996012e-06, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 1.244787715249003e-06, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07145135929689041, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The current policy rate is at a record high of 11.25% as of June 2023. If inflation shows signs of consistent decline towards the target rate of 3% (\u00b11%), it could prompt the central bank to consider rate cuts. Global economic conditions, particularly the policies of major economies like the US, can influence Mexico's monetary policy decisions. Domestic economic growth is also a factor; if it slows significantly, it might encourage rate cuts to stimulate the economy. The time frame allows for over a year for conditions to change and for the central bank to make a decision. Recent statements from the Bank of Mexico have indicated a cautious approach, suggesting they may keep rates high for an extended period to ensure inflation is under control. Historically, central banks typically move cautiously, maintaining higher rates for some time after inflation peaks to ensure price stability. Given these factors, there is a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. If inflation shows a consistent downward trend over the next 6-12 months and economic growth remains subdued, the probability of a rate cut announcement would increase.

(a) Central Bank of Mexico interest rate cut: The Bank of Mexico (Banxico) has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation. As of June 2023, the interest rate is at 11.25%, which is historically high. However, there are several factors to consider: 1. Inflation in Mexico has been gradually decreasing, though it's still above the target range. 2. Global economic conditions, including potential slowdowns in major economies, might pressure Banxico to consider rate cuts to stimulate growth. 3. The U.S. Federal Reserve's decisions greatly influence Banxico's policy. If the Fed starts cutting rates, Banxico might follow suit. 4. The timeframe (by August 31, 2024) gives Banxico over a year to make this decision, which is a considerable amount of time for economic conditions to change. Given these factors, there's a moderate to high chance of Banxico announcing a rate cut by mid-2024. (b) Fisker receiving over $500 million in grants: This scenario seems less likely for several reasons: 1. $500 million is a substantial amount for government grants, especially for a single company. 2. Fisker is a relatively new and smaller player in the EV market compared to established automakers. 3. The U.S. government has been supportive of EV initiatives, but typically spreads funding across multiple companies and projects. 4. Fisker's financial situation and production capabilities might not justify such a large grant. 5. The timeframe (by July 31, 2024) is relatively short for such a significant grant to be approved and announced. However, it's not impossible, especially if there's a major policy shift towards aggressive EV adoption. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. The Banxico rate cut seems more likely than the Fisker grant. Even if we assume a relatively low probability for the Fisker grant, the combined probability of either event occurring is boosted by the higher likelihood of the Banxico rate cut."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.011127534407154027, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.002781883601788507, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1500011094797649, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

While Google has faced some labor disputes and unionization efforts, they haven't resulted in large-scale strikes. For this to occur, a significant labor dispute would need to arise, escalate to a major strike, and then be resolved - all within about a year. While possible, this scenario seems unlikely given Google's history and current labor relations. Considering both scenarios: - The Washington Lottery offering online products seems unlikely in the given timeframe due to regulatory and infrastructure challenges. - A major Google workers' strike occurring and being resolved is also unlikely, given the current labor climate at the company and the specific conditions required for this outcome. However, we must consider that only one of these events needs to occur for a YES resolution. This slightly increases the overall probability. Additionally, the tech industry can move quickly, and labor relations can change rapidly, so we can't completely rule out either scenario.

Specific requirement: The question specifically requires a 72-hour waiting period, not longer or shorter. This narrow definition reduces the probability of a match. 7. Upcoming election: With the 2024 presidential election approaching in November, some states might be motivated to implement new voting procedures, but they may also be wary of making significant changes close to a major election. 8. Reporting requirement: The implementation must be reported by at least two major national news outlets, which is likely to occur if such a measure is passed, given its newsworthy nature. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate but not high chance of another state implementing exactly a 72-hour waiting period for voting registration by August 2024. The existing precedent and ongoing efforts to restrict voting in some states increase the likelihood, but the specific time frame, the exact 72-hour requirement, and potential controversy act as limiting factors."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "155f77e1-aff1-4061-9ab5-ea00b514e4a0", "title": "Will Ohio remove the work requirement from its Medicaid plan by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the state of Ohio officially announces the removal of the work requirement from its Medicaid plan.

However, a month-over-month increase exceeding 0.5% is quite substantial and would represent a significant deviation from recent trends. The central bank's efforts to control inflation make such a large monthly increase less likely, but not impossible. External shocks, such as a sudden increase in oil prices or a major disruption in the global supply chain, could potentially cause such a spike.

Given the extended timeframe (October 2023 to July 2024) and the relatively low threshold (0.5% month-over-month increase), it's quite possible that at least one month will see such an increase. I estimate the probability of this occurring at about 60%. For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. We need to multiply these probabilities: 0.70 * 0.60 = 0.42 or 42%. This calculation assumes independence between the two events, which may not be entirely accurate as global economic conditions could affect both outcomes.

As of mid-2023, the U.S. housing market has been experiencing challenges due to high interest rates and inflation. However, there are signs that the Federal Reserve may slow down or pause interest rate hikes, which could potentially stimulate the housing market. Three consecutive months of increase by July 2024 is a relatively short timeframe, and it's not uncommon to see such patterns in the housing market, especially considering potential seasonal effects.

This gives a long period for potential developments, but also means Scott's statement might become less relevant post-election. 4. Fact-checking and media scrutiny: If Scott's statement is demonstrably false, increased media scrutiny could pressure him to retract or alter it. However, statements about policy positions often have some degree of interpretation, making clear-cut falsehoods less likely. 5. Biden's actions: If Biden were to make significant changes to his criminal justice reform stance, it could potentially prompt Scott to alter his statement. However, major policy shifts are relatively rare. 6.

As of 2023, Zika is no longer considered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO. However, the WHO has not yet officially declared the outbreak 'over.' The organization tends to be cautious about such declarations to prevent complacency. Given that it's been several years since the peak of the outbreak and cases have significantly declined, it's possible the WHO might make such a declaration by August 2024. However, without recent indications from the WHO about plans to make such a declaration, this remains uncertain. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at about 0.4. b) Global Fund announcing over $400 million in new commitments by July 2024: The Global Fund is a major international organization that regularly makes large funding commitments to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In recent years, they've made several announcements of funding commitments exceeding $400 million. Given their history and the ongoing global health challenges, it's quite likely they will announce new commitments exceeding $400 million by July 2024.

Current youngest music director: While I don't have precise information on who currently holds the title of youngest music director of a major orchestra, it's worth noting that many conductors start their careers quite young. For example, Gustavo Dudamel became music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic at age 28 in 2009. 4. Likelihood of new appointment: For Collon to be recognized as the youngest, he would need to be appointed as music director of a major orchestra very soon, and this appointment would need to be at a younger age than any other current music director. Given his current age of 40, this seems unlikely. 5. Recognition process: Even if Collon were to be appointed to a major orchestra soon, the question requires official recognition from at least two reputable sources.

The likelihood of Collon being the youngest among all of them is low. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that Nicholas Collon will be recognized as the youngest music director of a major orchestra by July 2024.

The fact that intraday highs count for resolution increases the likelihood of this condition being met. Combining these factors: - The World Bank condition seems more likely than not to occur, perhaps around 70% probability. - The IBEX 35 condition also seems more likely than not, perhaps around 60% probability. Since only one of these conditions needs to be met for the question to resolve as YES, we need to calculate the probability of at least one occurring.

Netflix's financial position: The company has been facing challenges with subscriber growth and increased competition, which might make them more cautious about expensive sports rights deals. 5. Recent developments: In 2022, Netflix bid for Formula 1 rights but lost to ESPN. This indicates an interest in sports broadcasting, even if they haven't secured a deal yet. 6. Potential partners: Major sports leagues and events (NFL, MLB, NBA, FIFA World Cup, Olympics) typically have long-term contracts with traditional broadcasters, making it challenging for Netflix to secure rights in the short term. 7. Netflix's evolving content strategy: The company has been experimenting with live events (e.g., Chris Rock's live comedy special), showing a willingness to expand beyond their traditional model. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance that Netflix will announce a major sports media partnership by July 2024. While they have shown interest in sports content and are likely feeling pressure from competitors, the short timeframe and the complexity of securing major sports rights make it challenging.

(a) Netflix announcing a new major sports media partnership: Netflix has been gradually expanding into the sports content arena, but primarily through documentaries and series rather than live sports. However, there have been indications that Netflix might be considering live sports partnerships: In 2022, Netflix bid for streaming rights to Formula 1 races but lost to Disney. They've shown interest in sports-adjacent content like the 'Drive to Survive' F1 series. The streaming market is becoming increasingly competitive, which might push Netflix to explore new content areas. Despite these factors, Netflix has historically been hesitant to enter live sports due to the high costs involved. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for such a significant strategic shift. While it's possible, it's not highly probable given Netflix's current stance and the complexities involved in securing major sports rights. (b) NFL settling the 'Sunday Ticket' antitrust case for less than $4.7 billion: The NFL Sunday Ticket antitrust case is a complex legal matter. Settling for less than $4.7 billion would be a significant concession from the NFL, considering: The NFL's strong market position and the value of its content. The league's history of aggressively protecting its rights and revenue streams. The potential precedent such a settlement could set for future negotiations. However, antitrust cases can be unpredictable, and the NFL might choose to settle to avoid prolonged litigation and potential reputational damage. The specified amount ($4,707,259,944) is very precise, which suggests it might be based on some insider information or analysis. Combining probabilities: For both events to occur, we need them to happen independently and within the given timeframe. Given the analysis above, I would assess the probability of the Netflix partnership as relatively low (around 20-25%) and the NFL settlement as slightly higher but still below 50% (perhaps 30-35%).

However, they have been experimenting with sports-adjacent content like documentaries and reality shows. Given the competitive streaming landscape and the importance of sports rights in attracting and retaining subscribers, there's a possibility that Netflix might make a move in this direction. The timeframe of about 13 months (from the question's creation date to the resolution date) provides a reasonable window for such a deal to be negotiated and announced. However, Netflix's historical reluctance to invest heavily in live sports rights makes this scenario less likely. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 20%. b) NFL settling the 'Sunday Ticket' antitrust case for less than $4.7 billion: The NFL Sunday Ticket antitrust case is a complex legal matter. The NFL has strong incentives to protect its valuable media rights, and $4.7 billion is a significant amount. However, antitrust cases can be unpredictable, and settling for a lower amount might be preferable to a prolonged legal battle or an unfavorable court decision. The NFL might also consider the potential negative publicity from a drawn-out case. Given these factors, there's a moderate chance of a settlement below the specified amount. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs.

Global economic outlook: The global economy is expected to face challenges in 2023 and 2024, which might influence South Korea's monetary policy. 4. Historical context: The Bank of Korea tends to move rates gradually and maintain stability when possible. 5. Inflation targets: The Bank of Korea aims to keep inflation at 2%. If inflation remains above this target, it could justify maintaining higher rates. 6. Time frame: The question is about August 2024, which is more than a year away. This long time frame increases uncertainty. 7. Global monetary policies: Actions by major central banks, especially the U.S. Federal Reserve, can influence South Korea's monetary policy. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance that the rate will remain at or above 3.50% in August 2024. The Bank of Korea is likely to be cautious about lowering rates too quickly, especially if inflationary pressures persist. However, the long time frame and potential for global economic changes introduce significant uncertainty."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "88700d1b-8793-42c6-b269-b468f22f4103", "title": "Will the African Union declare the current mpox outbreak over by August 2024 and will the Central Bank of South Korea's base rate remain at or above 3.50% in August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES only if both of the following conditions are met: (1) The African Union officially declares the ongoing mpox outbreak over by August 31, 2024.

(a) The African Union declaring the mpox outbreak over: The mpox outbreak has been a concern for several years, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it a global health emergency in July 2022. While many countries have made progress in controlling the outbreak, it's unclear if the African Union will officially declare it over by August 2024. The African continent has been particularly affected by mpox, and they may be more cautious in declaring the outbreak over. However, given the time frame (over a year from now), there's a reasonable chance that significant progress could be made in controlling the outbreak. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 40%. (b) South Korea's base rate remaining at or above 3.50%: As of June 2023, South Korea's base rate is 3.50%. The Bank of Korea has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, but there are signs that they might pause or even consider cutting rates in the future due to economic pressures. However, predicting interest rates over a year in advance is challenging. Global economic conditions, inflation rates, and other factors could influence the decision. Given the current rate and the possibility of economic uncertainties persisting, there's a moderate chance the rate will remain at or above 3.50% by August 2024.

The political climate in Illinois is generally Democratic-leaning, with Governor J.B. Pritzker being supportive of abortion rights.

Part A: Illinois maintaining its current legal stance on abortion access by July 2024. Illinois has been known for its strong pro-choice stance, and the 2023 decision by the Illinois Supreme Court to strike down stricter regulations on abortion providers aligns with this position. Given the following factors: 1. Illinois has a Democratic governor and a Democratic-controlled legislature, both of which support abortion rights. 2. The Illinois Supreme Court's decision in 2023 was relatively recent, making it less likely to be overturned quickly. 3. There's no indication of a significant shift in public opinion or political landscape in Illinois that would prompt a reversal. The probability of Illinois maintaining its current legal stance on abortion access by July 2024 seems very high, perhaps around 90-95%. Part B: HHS's rule on telehealth services being enacted by August 2024. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been working on various telehealth regulations, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, enacting a specific rule targeting the regulation of telehealth services by August 2024 is less certain: 1. The process of creating and enacting federal rules can be lengthy and subject to delays. 2. The upcoming 2024 presidential election could potentially impact HHS priorities and timelines. 3. There's ongoing debate about telehealth regulations, which could slow down the process. Given these factors, the probability of the HHS rule being enacted by August 2024 is more uncertain, perhaps around 50-60%.

In fact, they have not endorsed a Republican presidential candidate in over 70 years. The union typically supports candidates who advocate for workers' rights, fair wages, and strong labor protections - positions more commonly associated with Democrats. Given this long-standing trend and the current political climate, it seems highly unlikely that the UAW would endorse a Republican candidate by July 2024. The probability of this occurring is very low. b) U.S. announcing plans to build additional nuclear reactors: The U.S. has been showing increased interest in nuclear energy as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. However, building new nuclear reactors is a complex, long-term process involving significant planning, regulation, and investment. Currently, there are only two new reactors being built in the U.S. (Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia). While there is growing support for nuclear energy, announcing plans for additional reactors beyond these two would require a significant shift in energy policy. The Biden administration has shown support for nuclear energy, including in its clean energy plans. However, concrete plans for new reactors beyond the current two haven't been announced. Given the timeframe (by July 2024), which is relatively short for such major policy decisions, and the fact that 2024 is an election year (which might delay significant policy announcements), the likelihood of this happening is moderate but not high.

Recent history: Given that marijuana was legalized relatively recently through legislative means, there's little reason for the state to hold a referendum on a matter that has already been decided. Political climate: New York is generally considered a progressive state, and the legalization of marijuana aligns with this stance. There's no significant political push to reverse the current law.

Organizing a state-wide referendum in such a short time frame is highly unlikely, especially without any prior indications or discussions in the public sphere. Lack of public discourse: There have been no notable public discussions or political movements calling for a referendum on marijuana legalization in New York. Constitutional requirements: New York doesn't have a process for citizen-initiated referendums. Any referendum would need to be proposed by the legislature, which seems unnecessary given the existing law.

Historical context: During the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, jobless claims did exceed 250,000 for extended periods. However, these were exceptional circumstances. 4. Time frame: The question asks about the period from now until August 2024, which is about 14 months. This is a significant amount of time during which economic conditions could change. 5. Labor market strength: The U.S. labor market has remained tight, with low unemployment rates and high job openings, which suggests resilience against a sudden spike in jobless claims. 6. Potential risks: Factors that could lead to increased jobless claims include a recession, major industry disruptions, or unforeseen global events. Given these considerations, it seems unlikely that jobless claims will exceed 250,000 for five consecutive weeks by August 2024. The economy would need to deteriorate significantly from its current state for this to occur. While it's not impossible, especially given potential risks and the uncertain nature of economic forecasts, it doesn't appear to be the most probable outcome. However, we must acknowledge the uncertainty involved in predicting economic conditions over a 14-month period. There's always a possibility of unexpected events or economic shocks that could rapidly change the situation."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d9afeae5-925c-40dd-ad4c-0e75fce3b0f1", "title": "Will the Bank of England announce an interest rate cut by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if the Bank of England officially announces a decrease in its bank rate by July 31, 2024.

Additionally, if the UK economy shows signs of significant slowdown or recession, it might prompt the BoE to consider rate cuts. Global economic conditions can also influence BoE's decisions. Given these factors, I believe the probability of a rate cut by July 2024 is relatively low, but not negligible. The BoE is likely to want to see sustained evidence of inflation returning to its 2% target before considering rate cuts, and economic forecasts generally do not predict a severe recession in the UK that would necessitate rapid policy reversal.

The last time they exceeded this threshold for an extended period was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the economy has shown some signs of slowing, it would take a significant economic downturn or crisis for jobless claims to consistently exceed 250,000 for five weeks.

For the BoE to cut rates by July 2024, we would need to see a significant reduction in inflation and potentially some economic struggles that warrant monetary easing. While this is possible, especially given the long-term effects of tightening monetary policy, it's not highly likely within this timeframe. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at about 30-35%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities. Even if we take the higher estimates for each event (25% and 35%), the combined probability would be 0.25 * 0.35 = 0.0875 or 8.75%. However, it's worth noting that these events are not entirely independent. Economic conditions that would lead to high jobless claims in the U.S. might also influence the BoE's decision to cut rates.

(a) U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 250,000 for five consecutive weeks by August 2024: The U.S. job market has been relatively strong in recent years, with unemployment rates remaining low. However, there are concerns about a potential economic slowdown or recession. As of mid-2023, weekly jobless claims have generally been below 250,000, but economic conditions can change rapidly. Factors to consider: 1. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightening could lead to job market cooling. 2. Potential global economic uncertainties or geopolitical events could impact the U.S. economy. 3. Technological disruptions or industry-specific issues could lead to layoffs. Given the timeframe (by August 2024) and the requirement for five consecutive weeks, this scenario seems possible but not highly probable.

(a) Mpox outbreak in Nigeria being declared over by July 2024: Nigeria has been experiencing mpox outbreaks for several years, with the disease being endemic in the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the global mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in July 2022, but this was ended in May 2023. Nigeria has been working on controlling the outbreak, but complete eradication is challenging due to the endemic nature of the disease. The timeline (by July 2024) gives about a year from now, which is a reasonable period for significant progress in controlling the outbreak. However, declaring an outbreak 'over' requires a specific period without new cases, which can be difficult to achieve for endemic diseases. Given these factors, I estimate there's a moderate chance (around 60%) that Nigeria's mpox outbreak will be declared over by July 2024. (b) Congo receiving mpox vaccines from WHO by August 2024: The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has also been experiencing mpox outbreaks. The WHO has been working on improving global access to mpox vaccines, especially for affected countries in Africa. The timeline (by August 2024) provides more than a year for vaccine distribution efforts. The WHO has previously supplied vaccines to DRC for other outbreaks (like Ebola), showing a precedent for such actions. However, vaccine distribution can face logistical challenges, especially in remote areas of DRC. Considering these points, I estimate there's a relatively high chance (around 75%) that Congo will receive mpox vaccines from WHO by August 2024.

The country has experience in managing these outbreaks, and health authorities have been working to control the spread. However, declaring an outbreak 'over' typically requires a significant period without new cases. Given that we have about a year until the resolution date, there's a reasonable chance that Nigeria could get the outbreak under control. The involvement of the WHO and international attention on mpox increases the likelihood of resources being directed towards this goal. (b) Congo receiving mpox vaccines from the WHO by August 31, 2024: The WHO has been working to distribute mpox vaccines to affected countries, especially in Africa where the disease is endemic. Congo, being one of the countries with a history of mpox cases, is likely to be on the list for vaccine distribution. The timeline of over a year provides ample opportunity for logistical arrangements and vaccine production. Moreover, the global focus on preventing future outbreaks increases the likelihood of vaccine distribution to at-risk countries. Considering both scenarios: 1. Each event has a reasonable chance of occurring independently. 2. We only need one of these events to happen for the question to resolve as YES. 3. The timeframe (over a year) is relatively long, allowing for significant developments in both areas. 4. Global health initiatives and increased awareness about mpox work in favor of both outcomes.

For the Bank to announce a rate cut by August 2024, we would need to see significant progress in controlling inflation and potentially some economic slowdown that would warrant monetary easing.

This is a relatively long period, allowing for negotiations and legal processes to unfold. 2. Google's history with data protection authorities: Google has faced numerous data protection challenges globally and has often sought to resolve issues through settlements or negotiations. For example, in 2019, Google agreed to pay $170 million to settle allegations by the US Federal Trade Commission and New York Attorney General that YouTube illegally collected children's personal information. 3. UK regulatory environment: The UK has been increasingly assertive in enforcing data protection regulations, especially post-Brexit. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has shown willingness to impose significant fines on tech giants for data protection violations. 4. Google's approach to regulatory challenges: Google typically tries to cooperate with authorities and often seeks to resolve issues through negotiations rather than prolonged legal battles. This approach helps maintain their public image and business operations. 5. Potential benefits of settlement: Both parties have incentives to reach a settlement. For Google, it can limit reputational damage and potentially reduce the fine amount. For the UK authority, a settlement ensures compliance and can be seen as a regulatory success. 6. Complexity of the issue: Data protection violations can be complex, and negotiations might take time. However, 14 months should be sufficient for both parties to come to an agreement if they are willing. 7. Precedents: There have been several cases where tech companies reached settlements with European data protection authorities within similar timeframes. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Google and the UK data protection authority will reach a settlement by August 2024. The extended timeframe, Google's history of settling such matters, and the mutual benefits of reaching an agreement all point towards a probable settlement. However, there are uncertainties. The specifics of the alleged violations, the size of the potential fine, and any unforeseen complications in negotiations could potentially delay or prevent a settlement. Considering all these factors, I would estimate a moderately high probability of a settlement being reached."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "9414e78b-0437-424d-be6a-b2ceaf1c5503", "title": "Will the European Commission implement a significant tariff on Chinese-made solar panels by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by August 31, 2024, the European Commission officially implements a tariff of 50% or higher on imports of Chinese-made solar panels.

In 2013, the EU imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures on Chinese solar panels, which were phased out in 2018. This historical precedent shows that such actions are possible. 2. Recent developments: The EU has been increasingly concerned about its reliance on Chinese imports, especially in strategic sectors like renewable energy. There's a growing push for 'strategic autonomy' in the EU. 3. Climate goals: The EU has ambitious climate targets, and solar energy is crucial to achieving these. However, they also want to develop their domestic solar industry, which could motivate protectionist measures. 4. Timeframe: The question specifies implementation by August 2024, which is about 14 months from the question's creation date. This is a relatively short time for such a significant policy change, considering the bureaucratic processes involved in EU decision-making. 5. Magnitude of the tariff: The question specifies a tariff of 50% or higher, which is quite substantial. Such a high tariff would be a very aggressive move and might face opposition from member states concerned about rising costs for solar installations. 6. Global economic context: The world is facing economic uncertainties, and such a high tariff could potentially escalate trade tensions not just with China but possibly with other trading partners. 7. WTO considerations: A tariff this high might face challenges at the World Trade Organization, which the EU would need to consider. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely but not impossible for the EU to implement such a high tariff in this timeframe.

Seasonal considerations: August is typically not a peak agricultural season in Argentina, which might reduce the urgency for resolving any potential strikes quickly. 5. Political landscape: The political situation in Argentina can influence labor relations. Any changes in government policies or leadership could affect the likelihood of strikes or their duration. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a specific two-month period (July-August 2024) that is relatively far in the future. This increases uncertainty, as many factors could change between now and then. 7. Resolution criteria: The question requires that the strike, if it occurs, must last until at least August 31, 2024, and be confirmed by official statements and multiple news sources. This sets a high bar for a \"YES\" resolution. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that a new strike would begin and persist for such a long period, especially considering the specific timing and resolution criteria. While labor disputes are possible, the chances of one lasting through the entire specified period and meeting all the stated conditions are relatively low."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "7c669391-2d72-4db9-a3ca-0f79670a30f2", "title": "Will both of the following occur in August 2024: (a) The Central Bank of Brazil's Selic rate remains at or above 13.25% and (b) Argentine agricultural workers remain on strike?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if both of the following conditions are met: (a) The Central Bank of Brazil's Selic rate is reported to be at or above 13.25% at any point during August 2024, confirmed by official Central Bank of Brazil announcements or at least two reputable financial news sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, Folha de S.Paulo), and (b) By August 31, 2024, agricultural workers in Argentina are still on strike or have not fully resumed normal operations following any current labor dispute, confirmed by official statements from agricultural organizations, the unions representing the workers, or the Argentine government, and reported by at least two reputable news sources (such as Clar\u00edn, La Naci\u00f3n, or Reuters).

The Central Bank of Brazil has been maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation. However, predicting the Selic rate for August 2024 is challenging due to the long time horizon. Brazil's economy and global economic conditions can change significantly in over a year. That said, given Brazil's history of relatively high interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures, it's plausible that the rate could remain at or above 13.25% in August 2024. I'd estimate this part has about a 60% chance of occurring. b) Argentine agricultural workers' strike: Predicting a specific strike more than a year in advance is extremely difficult. Argentina has a history of labor disputes in the agricultural sector, often related to economic policies, export taxes, or working conditions. However, strikes typically don't last for extended periods, and it's unlikely that a strike starting now would continue until August 2024. The question doesn't specify when the strike should start, only that it should be ongoing in August 2024. Given Argentina's economic challenges and history of labor disputes, it's possible a new strike could occur around that time, but it's far from certain. I'd estimate this part has about a 30% chance of occurring. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18 or 18%. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent. Both are influenced by broader economic conditions in South America.

However, there are expectations that the rate might start decreasing in the coming months as inflation shows signs of easing. The question is about August 2024, which is more than a year away. Given the current global economic uncertainties and Brazil's historical struggle with inflation, it's plausible that the Selic rate could remain high. However, if the economy improves and inflation is brought under control, there could be significant cuts to the rate by August 2024. b) Argentine agricultural workers' strike: Argentina has a history of labor disputes, particularly in the agricultural sector. However, predicting a specific strike more than a year in advance is challenging. Most strikes, even prolonged ones, typically resolve within weeks or months rather than lasting over a year. Considering both scenarios: 1. For the Selic rate to remain at or above 13.25% in August 2024, Brazil would need to continue facing significant economic challenges or inflationary pressures for over a year. While possible, this scenario seems less likely given the expected trajectory of monetary policy. 2. For Argentine agricultural workers to remain on strike through August 2024, a strike would need to start and then persist for an unusually long time. This is even less likely, as most labor disputes, even serious ones, are typically resolved much faster.

(a) Sony Corporation resolving a major workers' strike by July 2024: There is currently no major ongoing strike at Sony Corporation that I'm aware of. Sony has generally maintained good relations with its workforce, and major strikes are relatively rare in Japanese companies. The criteria for this part are quite specific and stringent (1000+ participants, lasting at least a week, official statements, international news coverage). The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short, giving less time for a major strike to develop and be resolved. Given these factors, the probability of this part occurring seems low, perhaps around 10-15%. (b) The United States maintaining a 100% tariff on Chinese-made machinery through August 2024: As of my last update, the US does not have a blanket 100% tariff on all Chinese-made machinery, though there are significant tariffs on many Chinese goods. US-China trade relations have been tense in recent years, and tariffs have been a key tool in US trade policy. The Biden administration has largely maintained Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods. However, there's increasing pressure to reduce inflation and improve supply chains, which could lead to tariff reductions. The specific 100% rate on all Chinese-made machinery would be an extreme measure, more likely to be imposed in case of severe deterioration of US-China relations. The timeframe (through August 2024) extends past the next US presidential election, adding uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of this specific 100% tariff being in place and maintained through August 2024 seems low to moderate, perhaps around 20-30%. Combining these probabilities, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of these events occurring. Using the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), and assuming independence: P(A or B) = 0.15 + 0.30 - (0.15 * 0.30) = 0.405.

This shows that the company has experienced such issues before and is willing to issue recalls when necessary. 2. Industry trends: Listeria outbreaks are not uncommon in the food industry, particularly in ready-to-eat meats and dairy products. Several meat producers have had to issue recalls due to listeria in recent years. 3.

However, no system is perfect, and contaminations can still occur despite best efforts. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 14 months (from the creation date to the resolution date). This is a significant amount of time during which an outbreak could potentially occur and be detected. 5. Regulatory environment: The FDA and USDA have become increasingly vigilant about food safety, which could lead to more frequent testing and a higher likelihood of detecting contaminations. 6. Company size and product range: Sara Lee is a large company with a wide range of packaged meat products. This increases the potential points of contamination and the likelihood of at least one product line being affected. 7. Consumer awareness: With increased public awareness about food safety, there's more pressure on companies to be transparent and quick to act on potential contaminations. However, we also need to consider that: 8. Improved technology and processes: Food safety technology and processes are continually improving, which could reduce the likelihood of contaminations. 9. Learning from past incidents: If Sara Lee has had recalls in the past, they may have implemented even stricter measures to prevent future occurrences. Given these factors, while a listeria-related recall is certainly possible, it's not highly probable within the given timeframe.

In fact, companies like LG Energy Solution have been expanding their presence in the US, including Ohio. Without any concrete indications of potential cancellation, the probability of this happening seems low. However, economic uncertainties, changes in government policies, or unforeseen circumstances could potentially lead to such a cancellation.

Reaching 3,500 points would require a significant increase of about 35%. While this is a substantial jump, it's not impossible given the timeframe of over a year. Factors that could contribute to such a rise include global economic recovery, strong performance of South Korean companies (especially in tech and manufacturing sectors), and positive geopolitical developments. However, challenges such as global economic uncertainties, trade tensions, and potential market corrections could hinder such growth. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of KOSPI reaching 3,500 points by August 2024 at about 30%.

As of now (June 2023), this ban is still in effect. The Nigerian government has shown a strong stance against cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about money laundering and terrorism financing. However, there has been growing pressure from the crypto community and some lawmakers to reconsider this ban.

Geopolitical factors: While tensions exist in various parts of the world, Indonesia's relatively neutral stance may help it avoid major economic disruptions. 9. Time frame: The question covers a period of about 10 months (October 2023 to July 2024), which is a relatively short time for two consecutive quarters of negative growth to occur, especially given Indonesia's recent economic performance. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Indonesia will avoid a recession by July 2024. The country's economic resilience, policy measures, and diverse economy provide a strong foundation for continued growth. However, there are always risks and uncertainties in economic forecasting, particularly given global economic challenges."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "f2123268-555e-413a-a664-ac2f250933f7", "title": "Will the World Health Organization declare the current measles outbreak over by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declares the ongoing measles outbreak over by August 31, 2024.

Time frame: The resolution date is August 31, 2024, which gives about two months from the question's creation date for the situation to improve dramatically. 3. Nature of measles outbreaks: Measles is highly contagious and can spread rapidly, especially in areas with low vaccination rates. Outbreaks can be persistent and difficult to control quickly. 4. Global vaccination efforts: The effectiveness and speed of vaccination campaigns worldwide will play a crucial role in containing the outbreak. However, organizing and implementing large-scale vaccination programs takes time. 5. WHO's decision-making process: The WHO typically declares an outbreak over only when there's clear evidence of sustained reduction in cases over a significant period. This process can be cautious and time-consuming. 6. Previous outbreak durations: Historical data on measles outbreaks shows that they can last for several months to over a year, depending on the scale and response effectiveness. 7. Global coordination: Ending a worldwide outbreak requires coordinated efforts across multiple countries, which can be challenging and time-consuming. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the WHO would declare the outbreak over by August 2024. The time frame is relatively short for a global outbreak to be fully contained, especially considering the highly contagious nature of measles and the time required for vaccination campaigns to take effect. The WHO is likely to be cautious in its assessment and would want to see a sustained period of reduced cases before making such a declaration.

(a) Indonesian economy avoiding recession by July 2024: Indonesia has shown resilience in its economic growth in recent years. As of 2023, Indonesia's economy was growing at a rate of around 5%, which is relatively strong. The country has a large domestic market, diverse exports, and has been implementing economic reforms to attract investment. However, global economic uncertainties, including potential slowdowns in major economies like China and the US, could impact Indonesia's growth. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short, which reduces the likelihood of drastic economic changes. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Indonesia avoiding a recession by July 2024 at around 0.8 or 80%. (b) WHO declaring the current measles outbreak over by August 2024: Measles outbreaks can be persistent, but they are also manageable with proper vaccination and public health measures. The WHO typically declares an outbreak over when there have been no new cases for a certain period, usually twice the incubation period of the disease. For measles, this would be about 42 days. The question doesn't specify when this outbreak started or its current status, which adds uncertainty. Additionally, global health resources have been strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially affecting the response to measles outbreaks. Given these factors and the timeframe (by August 2024), which allows for a reasonable period for control measures to take effect, I would estimate the probability of the WHO declaring the outbreak over by August 2024 at around 0.7 or 70%.

The country's GDP growth has been positive, and it has managed to navigate global economic challenges relatively well. The Indonesian government has been implementing various economic policies to stimulate growth and attract investments. However, global economic uncertainties, including potential slowdowns in major economies, could impact Indonesia's growth. Given Indonesia's track record and the government's proactive measures, it seems more likely than not that Indonesia will avoid a recession by July 2024. 2. WHO declaring the measles outbreak over by August 2024: Measles outbreaks can be persistent, but they are also manageable with proper vaccination and public health measures. The WHO has been working with countries to improve vaccination rates and control outbreaks. However, declaring an outbreak 'over' typically requires a significant period without new cases. Given that we don't have specific information about the current state of the measles outbreak or its severity, it's harder to predict this outcome with certainty. The timeframe until August 2024 does provide a considerable period for control measures to take effect, but global health challenges can be unpredictable. Combining these factors: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs. This means we only need one of them to happen for a positive resolution. Given that the Indonesian economy seems more likely to avoid a recession than not, and there's a reasonable chance of the WHO declaring the measles outbreak over within the given timeframe, the overall probability of a YES resolution is fairly high.

The strike would need to last at least a week. 4. A resolution would need to be reached and widely reported. Given that there's no current indication of such a large-scale unionization effort or impending strike at Facebook, and considering the multiple specific criteria that need to be met, this scenario is also unlikely to occur by July 2024.

COVID-19 recovery: Australia has shown a robust recovery from the pandemic-induced downturn, which demonstrates the economy's resilience. Given these factors, it appears more likely than not that Australia will avoid a recession by July 2024.

Current market trends: As of June 2024, the housing market has been experiencing some volatility due to various economic factors. However, without specific recent data, it's difficult to determine the exact trajectory. 2. Economic conditions: The overall state of the economy, including factors like inflation rates, unemployment, and GDP growth, can significantly impact housing demand. Any sudden economic shifts could influence home sales. 3. Interest rates: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy and interest rate decisions play a crucial role in mortgage rates, which directly affect home affordability and sales. 4. Seasonal patterns: While the question asks for seasonally adjusted rates, there might still be some residual seasonal effects that could influence month-to-month changes. 5. Housing supply: The availability of homes on the market can affect sales numbers. A shortage of inventory could lead to decreased sales, even if demand remains high. 6. Time frame: We only have one month (July 2024) for this trend to manifest, which is a very short period. Given these factors, it's important to note that predicting short-term housing market trends is challenging. However, considering the short time frame (only one month) and the requirement for two consecutive months of decline, it seems less likely that we would see this specific pattern emerge. The housing market tends to move more slowly, and significant month-to-month changes are less common unless there's a major economic event. Additionally, the requirement for two consecutive months of decline makes it even less probable within this short timeframe. However, we can't completely rule out the possibility. Unexpected economic shocks, sudden changes in monetary policy, or unforeseen events could potentially cause a quick downturn in home sales.

However, global economic uncertainties, including potential slowdowns in major trading partners like China, could pose risks. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been implementing monetary policies to support economic growth. Given Australia's track record of avoiding recessions (it hasn't had one for about 30 years), and current economic indicators, it seems more likely than not that Australia will avoid a recession by July 2024. b) U.S. previously occupied home sales showing a decline for two consecutive months: The U.S. housing market has been experiencing fluctuations due to factors such as interest rates, inflation, and overall economic conditions. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions have a significant impact on mortgage rates, which in turn affect home sales. Given the volatility in the housing market and the relatively long timeframe (until July 2024), it's quite possible to see two consecutive months of decline in previously occupied home sales. Housing market cycles and seasonal variations also contribute to this likelihood. Combining these factors: For the question to resolve as YES, both conditions need to be met. While both seem reasonably likely, the requirement for both to occur simultaneously reduces the overall probability.

(a) Australian economy entering a recession: Australia has had a strong economy for many years, with its last recession occurring in 1991. However, recent global economic challenges, including high inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, have put pressure on many economies worldwide. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could potentially slow economic growth. Despite these challenges, Australia's economy has shown resilience, with strong employment figures and a robust mining sector. The likelihood of Australia entering a recession by July 2024 seems relatively low, but not impossible. I would estimate this probability at around 20-25%. (b) U.S. previously occupied home sales showing a decline for two consecutive months: The U.S. housing market has been experiencing volatility due to high interest rates, which have made mortgages more expensive and reduced affordability for many potential buyers. This has led to periods of declining home sales. However, there's also pent-up demand from buyers waiting for better conditions, and any easing of interest rates could stimulate sales. The housing market is sensitive to economic conditions and interest rate changes, making it more likely to see fluctuations. Two consecutive months of decline is a relatively short period and could occur due to various factors. I would estimate the probability of this happening by July 2024 at around 60-65%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs. Using the principle of probability of either event occurring, we calculate: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Assuming these events are largely independent, we can estimate: P(YES) = 0.25 + 0.65 - (0.25 * 0.65) \u2248 0.7375.

However, recent outbreaks in several countries have complicated these efforts. The timeline until August 2024 gives about 14 months for the situation to improve. While this is a reasonable amount of time for progress, completely eradicating an outbreak to the point where WHO would declare it over is challenging. The WHO is typically cautious in making such declarations to ensure no resurgence occurs.

The country has maintained positive economic growth even during challenging global conditions. According to the World Bank and IMF projections, Indonesia's economy is expected to grow by around 5% in 2023 and 2024. While external factors like global economic slowdowns or geopolitical tensions could impact Indonesia, the country's diverse economy and large domestic market provide some buffer against external shocks. Given these factors, I'd estimate there's about an 80% chance of Indonesia avoiding a recession by July 2024. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48 or 48%.

Part A: WHO declaring the current polio outbreak over by August 2024. The polio outbreak has been a significant global health concern. The WHO has been working diligently to eradicate polio worldwide. However, declaring an outbreak over requires sustained efforts and evidence of no new cases for a considerable period. Given that: 1. Polio eradication efforts have made significant progress over the years. 2. The WHO and partner organizations have extensive experience in managing polio outbreaks. 3. There's still over a year until the resolution date, allowing time for continued vaccination efforts and surveillance. However: 1. Polio outbreaks can be persistent and challenging to completely eradicate. 2. Global health resources have been strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially affecting polio eradication efforts. I estimate the probability of the WHO declaring the polio outbreak over by August 2024 to be around 0.6. Part B: Indonesian economy avoiding a recession by July 2024. Indonesia is Southeast Asia's largest economy and has shown resilience in recent years. Considering that: 1. Indonesia has maintained positive economic growth even during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. 2. The country has a large domestic market, which can help buffer against external economic shocks. 3. The government has been implementing various economic policies to stimulate growth. However: 1. Global economic uncertainties, including potential recessions in major economies, could impact Indonesia. 2. Geopolitical tensions and trade disputes may affect Indonesia's export-oriented sectors. I estimate the probability of Indonesia avoiding a recession by July 2024 to be around 0.75. Combining probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either part A or part B occurs. To calculate the overall probability, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + 0.75 - (0.6 * 0.75) = 1.35 - 0.45 = 0.9.

Current state of unionization: In May 2022, Apple store employees in Towson, Maryland, became the first to unionize in the US. This shows that unionization efforts are ongoing within Apple's retail workforce. 2. Colorado unionization efforts: In February 2023, workers at an Apple store in Glasgow, Colorado, voted to unionize, becoming the third Apple store in the US to do so. This indicates that there is a specific union presence in Colorado that could push for a contract. 3. Apple's stance on unions: Historically, Apple has been resistant to unionization efforts. The company has been accused of union-busting tactics and has generally tried to discourage unionization among its employees. 4. Timeframe: The question gives approximately one year from the creation date to the resolution date. Negotiating and finalizing a first union contract can often take longer than a year, especially if the company is resistant. 5. Precedent: As of June 2023, Apple has not finalized a union contract with any of its unionized stores in the US, including the one in Maryland that unionized over a year ago. 6. Legal obligations: While companies are required to bargain in good faith with unions, there's no legal requirement to reach an agreement within a specific timeframe. 7. Potential pressure: As more stores unionize and public awareness grows, Apple may face increasing pressure to negotiate contracts, which could expedite the process. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Apple will finalize a union contract with store employees in Colorado by July 2024. The company's historical resistance to unions, the lack of precedent for such contracts within Apple, and the typically lengthy process of negotiating first contracts all suggest a low probability of success within the given timeframe. However, the growing unionization movement within Apple stores and potential public pressure could push the company to act more quickly than it has in the past. There's also the possibility that Apple might choose to finalize a contract in Colorado first, even though it wasn't the first store to unionize, for strategic reasons.

Fresh Fields Inc. is not a real company (as far as I know), so we can't assess their specific track record or safety practices. The timeframe is relatively short (about a month from the creation date to the resolution date for this part). The criteria for confirmation are strict, requiring official confirmation and multiple news source reports. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of this part occurring to be relatively low, around 10-15%. b) U.S. Senate passing a bill to increase the FDA's budget by more than 20% by August 2024: A 20% budget increase for a major federal agency is significant and not common. The timeframe is slightly longer for this part (about two months from creation to resolution). The current political climate and the approaching election season might make significant budget changes less likely. However, food safety is generally a bipartisan issue, and recent outbreaks or concerns could potentially drive support for increased FDA funding. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of this part occurring to be around 20-25%.

As of mid-2023, the BOK has been maintaining a relatively high interest rate to combat inflation. 2. Global economic trends: The global economic outlook, especially policies of major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, influences the BOK's decisions. 3. Historical behavior: The BOK tends to move cautiously and in small increments when changing interest rates. 4.

Inflation trajectory: If inflation shows signs of cooling down over the next year, it could pave the way for rate cuts. 6. Economic growth concerns: If economic growth remains sluggish or declines, it could pressure the BOK to cut rates to stimulate the economy. Given these factors, there are arguments both for and against a rate cut by August 2024: For a rate cut: - The extended time frame allows for economic conditions to change significantly. - If global economic growth slows, it may prompt the BOK to cut rates to support the export-dependent Korean economy. - If inflation shows signs of moderating, it could give the BOK room to cut rates. Against a rate cut: - The BOK has been cautious about cutting rates due to concerns about financial stability and household debt. - If inflation remains persistent, the BOK may maintain higher rates for longer. - Geopolitical tensions or external shocks could lead to a more conservative monetary policy stance. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut by August 2024.

As of June 2023, the index has been performing well, but predicting its performance over a year into the future is challenging. However, given the general upward trend of stock markets over time and Brazil's economic potential, there's a moderate chance the index could recover to its October 2023 level by August 2024.

As of June 2023, many central banks worldwide have been raising rates to combat inflation. However, by August 2024, the economic landscape could change significantly. If inflation pressures ease and economic growth slows, there could be room for rate cuts. Given the uncertainty and the fact that we're looking more than a year into the future, let's estimate the probability of a rate cut announcement by August 2024 at around 50%. For both conditions to be met, we need to consider their joint probability. Assuming these events are independent (which is a simplification, as global economic conditions could affect both), we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.60 * 0.50 = 0.30 or 30%. However, we should consider that these events are not entirely independent. A global economic slowdown that might prompt the Bank of Korea to cut rates could also negatively impact the Bovespa index.

In fact, Michigan has been moving in a more progressive direction regarding LGBTQ+ rights. In March 2023, Michigan expanded its civil rights law to protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Given this trend, it seems unlikely that Michigan would enact new restrictions on transgender youth care. However, the question asks about modifying restrictions, which could also mean expanding access.

Time frame: The question is about August 2024, which is more than a year away from the current date. This long time frame increases uncertainty. 5. Historical context: South Korea has maintained relatively high interest rates compared to other developed economies in recent years. 6. Inflation outlook: If inflation persists or increases, the central bank may keep rates high or even increase them further. 7. Economic growth: If economic growth slows significantly, there might be pressure to lower rates to stimulate the economy. 8. Global monetary policies: Actions of major central banks like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank can influence South Korea's decisions. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance that the rate will remain at or above 3.50% in August 2024. The current rate is already at 3.50%, and given the persistent inflationary pressures globally, it's likely that central banks will maintain higher rates for an extended period. However, the long time frame until August 2024 introduces significant uncertainty. A lot can change in the global and South Korean economy in over a year, which could necessitate rate cuts if economic conditions deteriorate significantly. Considering all these factors, I estimate there's about a 65% chance that the rate will remain at or above 3.50% in August 2024."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "53fe46f2-60f0-4fbc-b6de-0b688d927ea3", "title": "Will Sony announce plans to increase its AI-related workforce by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, Sony publicly announces plans to increase its AI-related workforce.

The question asks about August 2024, which is more than a year away. Predicting interest rates this far in advance is challenging due to the many economic factors that can influence monetary policy. However, we can consider some key points: 1. Global economic trends: Many central banks worldwide are currently in a tightening cycle to combat inflation. However, by mid-2024, this cycle might have peaked or reversed. 2. South Korea's economic situation: The country has been facing inflationary pressures and slower economic growth. The central bank might need to maintain higher rates to control inflation, but it could also face pressure to lower rates to stimulate growth. 3. Historical context: South Korea's base rate has fluctuated significantly over the past decade, ranging from 0.50% to 3.50%. Given these factors, it's possible but not certain that the rate will remain at or above 3.50% in August 2024. I'd estimate this part has about a 60% chance of occurring. (b) Sony announcing plans to increase its AI-related workforce: Several factors support this possibility: 1. AI trend in tech industry: Many tech companies are heavily investing in AI, and Sony, as a major tech player, is likely to follow this trend. 2. Sony's existing AI initiatives: Sony has already shown interest in AI, with projects like its AI-powered robot dog Aibo and AI-enhanced imaging technologies. 3. Competitive pressure: To remain competitive in various markets (gaming, electronics, entertainment), Sony may need to bolster its AI capabilities. 4. Timeframe: The deadline of July 2024 gives Sony ample time to develop and announce such plans. However, there are also factors that might prevent this: 1. Economic uncertainties: If there's a global economic downturn, Sony might be cautious about expanding its workforce. 2. Alternative strategies: Sony might choose to invest in AI through partnerships or acquisitions rather than increasing its own workforce. 3.

Global economic context: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the US Federal Reserve, can influence Brazil's monetary policy decisions. 4. Historical patterns: The Central Bank of Brazil has shown willingness to adjust rates when economic conditions warrant it. 5. Time frame: The question gives a relatively long time frame (until July 2024), which increases the likelihood of a rate cut occurring within this period. 6. Recent statements: Any recent statements or forward guidance from the Central Bank of Brazil regarding their monetary policy stance would be crucial in assessing the likelihood of a rate cut. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderately high chance of an interest rate cut by July 2024. The extended time frame allows for economic conditions to potentially improve sufficiently to warrant a rate cut. However, this is not certain, as unforeseen economic shocks or persistent inflationary pressures could delay such a decision.

Given global economic trends and potential pressures to stimulate economic growth, there's a reasonable chance that the BCB might consider a rate cut within the given timeframe. The Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) of the BCB meets approximately every 45 days. This means there would be at least one, possibly two meetings before the resolution date where they could decide on a rate cut.

They usually wait for a sustained period of low case numbers and evidence of containment before making such declarations. 3.

This is a relatively short period for a disease outbreak to be fully contained and for the WHO to confidently declare it no longer a global emergency. 4.

WHO declaring the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa no longer a global emergency by August 2024: Rift Valley fever outbreaks can be severe but are typically localized and don't often reach the level of global emergency. The fact that it's currently considered a global emergency suggests it's a significant outbreak. The timeframe for resolution (about two months from the question's creation) is relatively short for completely containing such an outbreak.

In January 2022, Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill codifying abortion rights into state law. Given this recent action, there might be less urgency for a constitutional amendment. However, some lawmakers and activists may push for stronger protections through a constitutional amendment. The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for organizing a statewide referendum, which typically requires legislative approval and significant planning. While possible, it seems less likely within this timeframe. b) Indiana enacting stricter abortion regulations: Indiana has a history of enacting restrictive abortion laws. In August 2022, Indiana passed a near-total abortion ban, which was later blocked by the courts. Given this recent attempt and the state's Republican-controlled legislature, it's highly likely that Indiana will continue to pursue stricter abortion regulations. The timeframe (by July 2024) provides ample opportunity for the legislature to draft and pass new regulations. This component seems more probable than the New Jersey referendum. Considering these factors: The New Jersey referendum is possible but less likely due to recent legislative action and the short timeframe.

This gives only a one-month window for the referendum to occur, which is an extremely short timeframe for organizing a state-wide vote. 2.

The process usually takes several months to a year or more. 3. Current political climate: As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, there were no widely publicized plans for a healthcare funding referendum in Illinois. While healthcare is always an important issue, there's no indication that this specific topic was at the forefront of Illinois politics to the extent that would warrant a rushed referendum. 4. Logistical challenges: Organizing a state-wide referendum requires substantial resources, including printing ballots, setting up polling stations, and training election workers. It's highly unlikely that this could be accomplished in just one month. 5. Legal requirements: Illinois law likely has specific requirements for the timing and process of referendums, which would make it nearly impossible to organize one on such short notice. 6. Lack of public awareness: If a referendum were planned for July 2024, there would likely be significant public discussion and media coverage well in advance. The lack of such information (as implied by the question) suggests that no referendum was in the works. 7. Typical referendum timing: Referendums are often held alongside regular elections to maximize voter turnout and reduce costs. July is not a typical month for elections in the United States.

Geopolitical situation: The Beaufort Sea is located in the Arctic Ocean, bordered by Canada and Alaska (USA). This region is not known for significant militant activity or geopolitical tensions that would typically lead to such attacks. 2. Maritime traffic: The Beaufort Sea has relatively low maritime traffic compared to other major shipping routes. This reduces the number of potential targets for militant groups. 3. Environmental conditions: The Beaufort Sea is ice-covered for much of the year, which limits shipping activities and makes it a less likely target for militant groups. 4. Historical precedent: There is no significant history of militant attacks on oil tankers in this region. 5. Time frame: The question specifies a relatively short time frame (about two months from the creation date to the resolution date), which further reduces the likelihood of such an event occurring. 6. Regional militant groups: There are no well-known militant groups operating in this area that have the capability or motivation to attack oil tankers. 7. Security measures: Given the importance of oil transportation, tankers are likely to have security measures in place, making successful attacks less probable. 8. International focus: The Arctic region, including the Beaufort Sea, has been gaining international attention due to climate change and potential resource exploitation. This increased focus might lead to better monitoring and security in the area. Given these factors, the probability of a major oil spill occurring in the Beaufort Sea by August 2024 due to a militant attack on a tanker is extremely low.

Wade abortion ban from 1849 that went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. This law is being challenged in court. While conservative-leaning courts might be inclined to uphold such a ban, the legal process can be lengthy and unpredictable. There's no guarantee that a final decision will be reached by August 2024, let alone one that declares the ban constitutional. Moreover, there's significant opposition to the ban, which could influence the court's decision. For the question to resolve as YES, both of these conditions must be met, which significantly reduces the probability.

In 2022, the city implemented strict regulations on short-term rentals, requiring hosts to register with the city and limiting rentals to only when the host is present. Given this recent action, it's less likely that NYC will announce further significant restrictions within the next year.

After reaching record highs in early 2022, prices declined due to rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. However, as of early 2023, prices have shown signs of stabilizing and even increasing in some markets. Factors that could drive prices to new highs include: - Potential interest rate cuts - Continued housing supply shortages - Population growth and immigration - Pent-up demand from buyers who were priced out previously. Given these factors and the historical trend of Canadian home prices to appreciate over time, I'd estimate the probability of reaching a new record high by July 2024 at about 60%.

Current state of jobless claims: As of June 2023, U.S. weekly jobless claims have been consistently below 300,000 for an extended period. In fact, they've been hovering around 200,000-250,000 for most of 2023. 2. Economic outlook: The U.S. economy has shown resilience despite high inflation and interest rate hikes. However, there are concerns about a potential recession in the near future. 3. Federal Reserve actions: The Fed has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could potentially lead to job losses if it slows economic growth too much. 4. Historical context: During the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, jobless claims exceeded 300,000 for extended periods. However, these were exceptional circumstances. 5. Time frame: The question asks about the period from now until August 2024, which is about 14 months. This is a significant amount of time for economic conditions to change. 6. Threshold and consistency: The question requires not just exceeding 300,000 claims, but doing so for three consecutive weeks, which is a more stringent condition. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely but not impossible for jobless claims to exceed 300,000 for three consecutive weeks by August 2024. The economy would need to deteriorate significantly from its current state. While there are risks of a recession, the labor market has remained relatively strong. However, we can't rule out the possibility entirely. A severe economic downturn, perhaps triggered by ongoing inflation issues, geopolitical events, or unforeseen crises, could lead to a spike in jobless claims. Considering all these factors, I would assign a relatively low probability to this event occurring."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "06e96a77-38fc-4384-97b3-840c2cb00b95", "title": "Will US airline mechanics remain on strike through August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by August 31, 2024, airline mechanics in the United States are still on strike or have not fully resumed normal operations following any current labor dispute.

Current situation: As of now (June 2024), there is no major ongoing strike of airline mechanics in the United States. This is a crucial starting point, as it means a strike would need to begin and then persist for at least two months to resolve as YES. 2. Historical context: Airline mechanic strikes in the US are relatively rare and typically don't last for extended periods. The last major airline mechanic strike was the Northwest Airlines mechanics' strike in 2005, which lasted about 15 months but was an outlier in terms of duration. 3. Labor relations: The airline industry has been experiencing some labor tensions recently, particularly with pilots and flight attendants. However, mechanics haven't been at the forefront of these disputes. 4. Economic factors: The airline industry is still recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both airlines and workers may be hesitant to engage in prolonged labor disputes that could further harm the industry's recovery. 5. Negotiation processes: Even if a strike were to begin, there are typically intense negotiations and often government mediation to resolve disputes quickly, given the critical nature of air travel to the economy. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a specific two-month period (July and August 2024). For a YES resolution, a strike would need to either begin before July and last through August, or begin in July or August and persist until at least August 31st. 7. Resolution criteria: The question requires that the strike be ongoing by August 31, 2024, and that normal operations have not fully resumed. Partial returns to work or limited operations don't count as resolution. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that a major, prolonged airline mechanic strike would occur and persist through August 2024. While labor disputes in the airline industry are not uncommon, the specific conditions required for this question to resolve as YES are quite stringent. The absence of a current strike, the historical rarity of prolonged mechanic strikes, and the economic incentives for both sides to avoid extended disputes all point towards a low probability of this event occurring.

Economic outlook: While there are concerns about a potential recession, most economists don't predict a severe downturn that would cause such a significant spike in jobless claims. Historical context: During the COVID-19 pandemic, jobless claims spiked well above 300,000, but such extreme events are rare. Time frame: The period until August 2024 is relatively short for such a dramatic change in the job market. Given these factors, the probability of condition A occurring is low, perhaps around 15-20%. Condition B: US airline mechanics remaining on strike through August 2024. Current situation: As of June 2023, there is no ongoing major strike of airline mechanics in the US. Labor relations: The airline industry has a history of labor disputes, but prolonged strikes are relatively rare due to their economic impact. Time frame: The question asks about a strike lasting until August 2024, which is an extremely long duration for a labor dispute in this industry. Negotiation processes: Airlines and unions typically engage in extensive negotiations to avoid or quickly resolve strikes. The probability of condition B occurring is very low, perhaps around 5-10%. Joint Probability: For both conditions to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. Even if we take the higher estimates for each condition (20% for A and 10% for B), the joint probability would be 0.20 * 0.10 = 0.02 or 2%. However, there could be some correlation between these events. A severe economic downturn that causes high jobless claims might also contribute to prolonged labor disputes.

The last time claims exceeded 300,000 for an extended period was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the economy has shown some signs of slowing, it would take a significant economic downturn or crisis for claims to exceed 300,000 for three consecutive weeks.

(b) US airline mechanics remaining on strike: As of June 2023, there is no major ongoing strike of airline mechanics in the US. However, labor tensions in the airline industry have been high, with various unions negotiating new contracts. The probability of a strike occurring and lasting until August 2024 is relatively low, as most labor disputes are resolved within weeks or months. However, given the current labor climate, there's a small chance of a prolonged dispute. I'd estimate this probability at about 10%.

Historical jobless claims data: While I don't have access to the exact weekly jobless claims figures for France, it's important to note that 200,000 weekly claims would be an exceptionally high number for a country of France's size. Such high numbers are typically seen only during severe economic downturns or crises. 3. Economic outlook: France, like many other countries, has been facing economic challenges due to factors such as inflation and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are no current indications of an imminent severe economic crisis that would lead to such a dramatic spike in unemployment. 4.

It's likely they would intervene if jobless claims were approaching such high levels. 6.

Historical precedent: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) typically adjusts its policy twice a year, in April and October. Major policy shifts are rare and usually occur in response to significant economic events. 5.

(a) Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024: The RBI's monetary policy decisions are influenced by various factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic conditions. As of now (June 2023), India's inflation rate is above the RBI's target range, which typically calls for tighter monetary policy. However, by July 2024, the economic landscape could change significantly. Given the global trend towards looser monetary policy to stimulate economic growth post-pandemic, there's a possibility that the RBI might consider a rate cut if inflation is under control and economic growth needs a boost. However, without concrete economic data for 2024, it's difficult to predict with high certainty. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. (b) Central Bank of Singapore announcing a new exchange rate policy by August 2024: Singapore's monetary policy is primarily conducted through exchange rate management rather than interest rates. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reviews its exchange rate policy twice a year. While changes to the policy are not uncommon, they are typically adjustments to the existing framework rather than entirely new policies. The last major change to Singapore's exchange rate policy was in 1981 when they adopted the current basket, band, and crawl (BBC) system. Given the relative stability of this system and Singapore's preference for gradual adjustments, a completely new exchange rate policy seems less likely. However, significant global economic shifts or unforeseen circumstances could prompt a policy change. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.40 * 0.30 = 0.12 or 12%. This calculation assumes the events are independent, which may not be entirely accurate as global economic conditions could influence both decisions. However, given the different focuses of the two central banks (interest rates vs. exchange rates), the assumption of independence is reasonable for this estimate."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "bcaf6ec7-7d92-429b-b7d2-b8b3a99e2550", "title": "Will either the Reserve Bank of India announce an interest rate cut by July 2024, or the Central Bank of Singapore announce a new exchange rate policy by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) The Reserve Bank of India officially announces a decrease in its repo rate by July 31, 2024.

The ongoing economic pressures from sanctions and the conflict with Ukraine could lead to inflationary spikes. However, the Central Bank's historically conservative approach and focus on inflation control act as counterbalances. The relatively long time frame (10 months) increases the likelihood of seeing at least one month with high inflation. However, the threshold of 0.5% month-over-month is significant enough that it wouldn't be triggered by minor fluctuations.

In recent years, Russia has experienced periods of higher inflation, and while it has generally been brought under control, the possibility of a month with over 0.5% increase within a year is not unlikely. Economic uncertainties, potential fluctuations in oil prices, and ongoing global economic challenges could contribute to inflationary pressures. Probability for this condition: Around 60-70% 2.

However, if inflation shows signs of easing or if economic growth becomes a more pressing concern, the CBN might consider a rate cut. The timeframe until August 2024 is relatively long, allowing for potential changes in economic conditions. 2. European Central Bank (ECB): The ECB has been on a rate-hiking cycle to combat inflation in the Eurozone. As of June 2023, the main refinancing operations rate is at 4%. The ECB has signaled that it may continue to raise rates in the near term to bring inflation down to its 2% target. However, there are growing concerns about economic slowdown in the Eurozone. If inflation begins to ease and economic growth remains sluggish, the ECB might consider rate cuts. The August 2024 timeframe gives ample time for the current tightening cycle to potentially run its course and for economic conditions to shift. 3. Global economic context: The global economy is facing uncertainties due to various factors including geopolitical tensions, supply chain issues, and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors could influence both central banks' decisions in the coming year. 4. Historical precedent: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates after a tightening cycle unless there's a significant economic downturn or a rapid decline in inflation. However, the period until August 2024 is long enough for economic conditions to potentially change dramatically. 5. The question structure: It's important to note that only one of the two central banks needs to announce a rate cut for the question to resolve as YES, which increases the probability. Considering all these factors, while both central banks are currently in a tightening cycle, the relatively long timeframe until August 2024 leaves room for potential changes in economic conditions that could lead to a rate cut. The ECB seems more likely to cut rates than the CBN given the current economic situations, but both possibilities exist."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.3508831928831583, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) Tesla announcing additional layoffs beyond the initially reported 6% by August 2024: Tesla has already announced a 6% workforce reduction, which is significant. The likelihood of additional layoffs depends on several factors: Economic conditions: If there's a global economic downturn or a slowdown in the electric vehicle market, Tesla might need to cut costs further. Company performance: If Tesla's financial performance doesn't meet expectations, they might need to reduce expenses. Technological advancements: If Tesla implements more automation or AI, it could lead to further job cuts. Competition: Increased competition in the EV market might force Tesla to streamline operations. However, announcing additional layoffs so soon after a significant cut could harm employee morale and public perception.

Bloomberg Philanthropies donation: Michael Bloomberg has a history of significant philanthropic contributions, particularly in education. In 2020, he donated $100 million to four historically Black medical schools. However, a $600 million donation would be substantially larger. While Bloomberg has the means to make such a donation, it would be an exceptionally large single contribution, even for him. The likelihood of this specific donation occurring within the given timeframe seems relatively low, perhaps around 10-15%. 2. Bank of England interest rate cut: As of June 2024, the global economic situation and the UK's specific economic conditions would play a crucial role in this decision. The Bank of England has been battling high inflation, and interest rates have been raised to combat this. For a rate cut to occur by August 2024, we would need to see a significant improvement in inflation figures and potentially some economic slowdown justifying stimulus. Given the current economic uncertainties and the relatively short timeframe (about two months from the question's creation date to the resolution date), the probability of an interest rate cut seems moderate. The Bank of England typically moves cautiously, and rapid policy reversals are uncommon. However, if economic data shows a sharp decline in inflation or growth, a cut could be on the table. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30-35%. Combining probabilities: Since we need only one of these events to occur for a YES resolution, we can use the formula for the probability of at least one event occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

The timeframe (by July 2024) is relatively short for organizing a statewide referendum, especially on such a contentious issue.

The question mentions Georgia already has such a plan, indicating there's precedent. States are often looking for ways to improve health outcomes and reduce costs in their Medicaid programs. The timeframe (by July 2024) gives states over a year to implement such changes, which is feasible. However, adopting new Medicaid plans can be a complex and time-consuming process.

(a) Indiana holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024: The timeframe is relatively short (about 13 months from the question's creation date). Indiana is a predominantly conservative state, and there's no current strong indication of a push for enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that typically requires significant lead time and political will. There's no recent news or political movement suggesting Indiana is considering such a referendum. The probability of this occurring seems quite low, perhaps around 5-10%. (b) Another U.S. state adopting a Medicaid plan with a healthy behavior incentive: This is more likely to occur than part (a). Several states have already implemented or considered similar programs in recent years. The concept of incentivizing healthy behaviors in Medicaid plans is gaining traction as a way to improve health outcomes and potentially reduce costs. States are constantly looking for ways to innovate and improve their Medicaid programs. The timeframe (13 months) is reasonable for a state to develop and adopt such a plan. However, the process of adopting new Medicaid plans can be complex and time-consuming. The probability of this occurring seems moderate, perhaps around 30-40%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the complement rule of probability (P(A or B) = 1 - P(not A and not B)), we can estimate the overall probability. Let's use the higher end of our estimates for a more conservative approach: P(not A) = 0.90 (90% chance Indiana doesn't hold the referendum) P(not B) = 0.60 (60% chance no other state adopts the Medicaid plan) P(YES) = 1 - (0.90 * 0.60) = 1 - 0.54 = 0.46.

In recent years, the UNDP has made significant announcements, but they don't always reach this scale.

However, larger commitments do occur, especially for major global initiatives or crisis response.

However, a commitment of over $400 million is quite substantial. Looking at recent UNDP announcements, we can see that they do make large commitments, but not always of this magnitude. For example, in 2021, they announced a $100 million insurance and risk finance facility.

However, there have been instances of large-scale medical debt forgiveness in other countries, such as the United States. The collaboration with a nonprofit organization makes this scenario more plausible, as such organizations often work on debt relief initiatives. The timeframe (by August 2024) allows for about 14 months for such an initiative to be developed and implemented. Considering both scenarios: - The UNDP funding commitment seems more likely due to the organization's history of large-scale funding announcements and the global nature of their work. - The French hospital debt cancellation is less likely but still possible, especially given the involvement of a nonprofit organization. Given that only one of these events needs to occur for the question to resolve as YES, the overall probability is increased. However, both events are still relatively uncommon occurrences.

Let's analyze each part separately: a) Google layoffs: Google has been undergoing significant restructuring to focus more on AI. In January 2024, they already announced layoffs of about 12,000 employees. While this shows a willingness to make large-scale cuts, it also means they've recently trimmed their workforce. However, the tech industry is known for frequent restructuring, especially when pivoting towards new technologies like AI. Given the rapid advancements in AI and Google's commitment to staying competitive, it's plausible they might need to make further adjustments to their workforce. The threshold of 1,800 employees is relatively small for a company of Google's size, making this scenario quite possible. b) South African Reserve Bank (SARB) interest rate cut: As of June 2023, the SARB's repo rate was at 8.25%, which is relatively high. This high rate was set to combat inflation, which has been a global concern. However, by July 2024, more than a year will have passed, potentially allowing for economic conditions to change. If inflation pressures ease, there could be room for a rate cut. Additionally, if global economic conditions soften, the SARB might be inclined to stimulate the economy through a rate cut. The time frame until July 2024 allows for multiple SARB meetings, increasing the chances of a rate adjustment. Considering both scenarios, there seems to be a higher likelihood of at least one of these events occurring than neither happening. The Google layoff scenario is particularly plausible given the company's focus on AI and the relatively low threshold of 1,800 employees. The interest rate cut, while less certain, is also a real possibility given the extended timeframe and potential for changing economic conditions.

The state's recent focus has been on implementing and defending existing abortion restrictions rather than seeking additional public input. 5. National context: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, these have primarily been in states seeking to protect abortion rights. Texas, having already restricted abortion access, has less incentive to hold such a vote. 6. Legal challenges: Texas's current abortion laws are facing ongoing legal challenges. The state government may prefer to focus on defending these laws in court rather than opening up the issue to a public vote. 7. Political risk: Given the national trend of abortion rights referendums favoring pro-choice positions (even in some conservative states), Texas Republicans might view a referendum as a political risk. Considering these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Texas will hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024.

This shows that it's not an unprecedented level. 3. Economic factors: China's economy has been facing challenges, including a property market crisis, high youth unemployment, and slower growth. However, the government has been implementing stimulus measures to boost the economy. 4. Policy support: The Chinese government has a history of supporting the stock market during downturns. Recent policy moves suggest they are committed to stabilizing and boosting market confidence. 5. Global economic conditions: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, could impact Chinese stocks. 6. Time frame: The question allows for a relatively long period (about 14 months) for the index to reach 4,000 points, which increases the likelihood. 7. Intraday highs: The question specifies that intraday highs count, which slightly increases the probability compared to requiring a closing price above 4,000. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance the Shanghai Composite could reach 4,000 points by August 2024. The long time frame and the fact that intraday highs count work in favor of this outcome. However, the current economic challenges and the significant gain required (20-25%) make it far from certain."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "5204d34c-a71f-48c0-a399-f6dbec98e9a9", "title": "Will the Bank of Korea announce a reduction in its key interest rate by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if the Bank of Korea publicly announces a reduction in its key interest rate by August 31, 2024.

(a) 'Kingsman: The Blue Blood' becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie: The Kingsman franchise has been successful, but not record-breaking. The previous installments performed well but didn't come close to being the highest-grossing R-rated movies. The current highest-grossing R-rated movie is 'Joker' (2019) with $1.07 billion worldwide. For 'Kingsman: The Blue Blood' to surpass this, it would need to significantly outperform its predecessors and become a massive global hit. Given the track record of the franchise and the high bar set by 'Joker,' this seems highly unlikely. Probability estimate for (a): 0.05 (5%) (b) The UK economy avoiding a recession: The UK economy has been facing challenges, including high inflation and the aftermath of Brexit. However, recent economic indicators have shown some resilience, with the economy narrowly avoiding a recession in late 2022 and early 2023. The Bank of England and the government have been implementing measures to support economic growth. The resolution date is set for July 31, 2024, giving the economy time to potentially stabilize and grow. While there are risks, the probability of avoiding a recession seems moderately high.

Historical context: The Central Bank of Brazil typically reviews and sets its inflation targets well in advance. The current target of 3% for 2024 and 2025 was set in June 2021. This suggests that any changes to future targets are usually made with significant lead time. 2. Economic conditions: Brazil has been facing inflationary pressures in recent years. If these pressures persist or worsen, it could prompt the central bank to reconsider its target. 3. Policy stability: Central banks generally prefer to maintain stable targets to anchor inflation expectations. Frequent changes can undermine credibility. 4. Time frame: The question asks about a new target announcement by August 2024. This gives a relatively short window for such a significant policy change, especially considering that targets are usually set for future years. 5. Current target: The existing target of 3% is already considered relatively low for Brazil, given its historical inflation rates. This makes a further lowering less likely. 6. Global economic factors: Global economic conditions, including commodity prices and exchange rates, can influence Brazil's inflation outlook and potentially the need for a target adjustment. 7. Political considerations: Changes in government or shifts in economic policy could influence the central bank's decisions, although the bank is officially independent. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the Central Bank of Brazil would announce a new inflation target by August 2024. The existing target was set relatively recently, and central banks typically prefer stability in their targets. The time frame is also quite short for such a significant policy change. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility. Unexpected economic shocks or significant changes in the inflation outlook could prompt a reconsideration of the target. Additionally, if the current target is consistently missed, there might be pressure to adjust it.

However, given the current global economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, there's a possibility they might adjust their target.

They often announce new funding cycles or significant contributions. $400 million, while a large sum, is not unprecedented for the Global Fund. The timeframe (by July 2024) allows for over a year for such an announcement to be made, which is reasonable considering their typical funding cycles. Considering these factors: 1. We have two independent events, either of which would result in a 'YES' resolution. 2. The timeframes are relatively generous, giving ample time for either event to occur. 3.

Historical precedent: While I don't have specific information about past negotiations at Universal Studios Hollywood, labor agreements are typically reached and approved in most cases, even if it takes extended negotiations. 7. Public pressure: Theme parks are highly visible businesses, and negative publicity from labor disputes could impact Universal's reputation and visitor numbers.

Current economic conditions: As of June 2024, the Philippines' economy has been showing signs of recovery from the global economic slowdown. However, inflation rates and economic growth projections will play a crucial role in the central bank's decision. 2. Inflation trends: The central bank's primary mandate is to maintain price stability. If inflation is within the target range or trending downward, it might create room for a rate cut. 3. Global economic environment: The actions of major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, can influence the decisions of other central banks. If global economic conditions are improving and major economies are easing their monetary policies, it could provide a conducive environment for the Philippines to consider a rate cut. 4. Domestic growth concerns: If there are concerns about slowing economic growth, the central bank might be inclined to cut rates to stimulate the economy. 5. Exchange rate considerations: The central bank also needs to consider the impact of its decisions on the Philippine peso. A rate cut could potentially lead to currency depreciation, which might be a concern if it's already under pressure. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement by August 2024, which gives the central bank about two months from the creation date of this question to make a decision.

Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024. The short time frame and the central bank's typically cautious approach suggest that a rate cut is not highly likely.

Current political climate: New York is a predominantly Democratic state with strong support for abortion rights. The state already has robust protections for abortion access, including the Reproductive Health Act passed in 2019. 2. Existing legal framework: Given that New York already has strong abortion protections in place, there might be less urgency for a referendum compared to states with more restrictive laws. 3. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of August 2024, which is just over a year away. Organizing a statewide referendum is a complex process that typically requires significant lead time for planning, legislative approval, and public awareness campaigns. 4. Recent trends: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, these have primarily been in states where abortion rights were under threat or unclear. New York is not in this category. 5. Political priorities: With New York's abortion rights already secure, state leaders may focus on other pressing issues such as economic recovery, housing, or climate change rather than initiating a referendum on an already protected right. 6. Potential motivations: A referendum could be seen as a way to further solidify abortion rights in the state constitution, making them harder to overturn in the future. However, this would likely be a lower priority given the existing protections. 7. Legislative process: For a referendum to occur, it would typically need to be approved by the state legislature. There's no strong indication that such a move is currently being considered or championed by influential state politicians. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for New York to conduct such a referendum, it seems unlikely within the specified timeframe.

(a) President Biden delivering a speech at a National Education Association event in Arizona: Biden has a history of supporting education and teachers' unions. The NEA is one of the largest teachers' unions in the US and often invites political figures to speak at their events. However, Arizona is not typically considered a strong Democratic state, which might make it a less likely location for such an event. The timeframe is relatively short (about a month), which limits the opportunity for such an event to occur. Given these factors, the probability of this specific event happening in this short timeframe seems quite low, perhaps around 10%. (b) Wisconsin holding a referendum on public school funding: Education funding is often a contentious issue that can lead to referendums. Wisconsin has a history of holding referendums on various issues, including education. However, organizing a statewide referendum typically requires significant lead time for planning, approval, and implementation. The short timeframe (about a month) makes it unlikely that a referendum could be organized and held if it's not already in the planning stages. If such a referendum were already planned, it would likely be known publicly by now. Given these factors, the probability of this event occurring in the given timeframe also seems low, perhaps around 15%. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. To calculate the probability of at least one of these independent events occurring, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.10 + 0.15 - (0.10 * 0.15) = 0.25 - 0.015 = 0.235.

However, both countries have shown some willingness to engage in dialogue and negotiate trade terms. 3. Economic considerations: A 100% tariff would be an extreme measure that could significantly disrupt the textile industry and supply chains. It would likely face strong opposition from US retailers and consumers due to potential price increases. 4.

This shows the company is not averse to significant layoffs when deemed necessary. AI-focused reorganization: Zoom has explicitly announced an AI-focused reorganization plan. This suggests a shift in the company's strategy, which often leads to workforce restructuring. Tech industry trends: Many tech companies have been conducting layoffs in recent years, often citing AI integration and efficiency improvements as reasons. Time frame: The question allows for a full year (from July 2023 to July 2024) for these layoffs to occur, which is a considerable amount of time for a company to implement significant changes. Economic factors: The tech industry has been facing economic pressures, which could push companies like Zoom to reduce costs through layoffs. Zoom's financial performance: Zoom's growth has slowed since the peak of the pandemic, which might necessitate cost-cutting measures. AI integration: As Zoom focuses more on AI, it may need fewer employees in certain roles that can be automated or enhanced by AI technologies. However, there are also factors that might work against such a large layoff: Previous layoffs: Having already conducted significant layoffs in early 2023, Zoom might be hesitant to implement another large round of cuts so soon. Public perception: Another large layoff could negatively impact Zoom's public image and employee morale. Specific number: The threshold of 1,800 employees is quite specific and relatively high. While layoffs are possible, reaching this exact number or higher is less certain. Growth opportunities: Zoom might find new growth avenues that could mitigate the need for such large layoffs. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability that Zoom will lay off at least 1,800 employees by July 2024 as part of its AI-focused reorganization. The company has shown willingness to make significant cuts, and the AI focus could lead to substantial restructuring.

Zoom laid off about 1,300 employees (15% of its workforce) in February 2023, while PayPal cut 2,000 jobs (7% of its workforce) in January 2023. This suggests that both companies are not averse to large-scale layoffs when deemed necessary. AI-focused reorganization plans: Both companies have announced plans to integrate AI into their operations. This shift towards AI could potentially lead to job redundancies, especially in roles that can be automated or enhanced by AI technologies. Economic conditions: The tech industry has been facing challenges, including economic uncertainties and pressure to cut costs. This environment could push companies to continue optimizing their workforce. Timeframe: The question asks about layoffs by July 2024, which is about a year from now. This provides a significant window for companies to implement changes and potentially conduct layoffs. Threshold: The question specifies at least 1,800 employees, which is a substantial number. However, it's worth noting that this number is not far from the recent layoffs both companies have already conducted. Company size: As of 2023, Zoom has around 8,000 employees, while PayPal has about 29,900. For Zoom, 1,800 employees would represent over 22% of its workforce, which is a very significant portion. For PayPal, it would be about 6%, which is more in line with their previous layoff. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of this event occurring. PayPal seems more likely to reach this threshold due to its larger size and previous willingness to conduct large layoffs. Zoom, having already cut 15% of its workforce recently, might be less likely to make another such large cut so soon. However, the explicit link to AI-focused reorganization plans and the specific number of 1,800 employees make this less likely than a more general layoff question. Companies might implement AI gradually, leading to smaller, phased layoffs that don't reach the 1,800 threshold in one go.

The Biden administration has been encouraging states to drop work requirements. 2. Many states have already abandoned similar requirements due to legal challenges and implementation difficulties. 3. There's growing evidence that work requirements don't significantly increase employment but do reduce Medicaid enrollment. Given these factors, it seems reasonably likely that Michigan will remove the work requirement by July 2024. I'd estimate this probability at about 65%. (b) Bank of Canada announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: This is more challenging to predict due to the longer time frame and the complexity of economic factors. Consider: 1. As of 2023, the Bank of Canada has been maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation. 2. Economic forecasts suggest that inflation might cool down by late 2023 or early 2024. 3. However, the Bank typically moves cautiously and may wait for sustained evidence of lower inflation before cutting rates. 4. Global economic conditions and policies of other major central banks (like the US Federal Reserve) also influence the Bank of Canada's decisions. Given these factors, it's possible but not highly likely that the Bank of Canada will announce a rate cut by August 2024. I'd estimate this probability at about 40%. For the combined question to resolve as YES, both events need to occur. We calculate this by multiplying the individual probabilities: 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26 or 26%."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "e8358a95-0e99-4b7e-accd-2777614ccf34", "title": "Will either Michigan remove the work requirement from its Medicaid plan by July 2024, or the Bank of Canada announce an interest rate cut by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if at least one of the following occurs: (a) By July 31, 2024, the state of Michigan officially announces the removal of the work requirement from its Medicaid plan.

Michigan removing the work requirement from its Medicaid plan by July 2024: The work requirement for Medicaid in Michigan has been a contentious issue. In 2019, Michigan implemented work requirements, but they were quickly suspended due to legal challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2023, these requirements are not in effect. Given the ongoing debates about Medicaid work requirements across the US and the trend towards removing such requirements in many states, there's a moderate chance Michigan might officially remove this requirement by July 2024. However, it's not certain, as it depends on political factors and potential policy changes. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 40%. 2. Bank of Canada announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024: The Bank of Canada, like many central banks, has been in a tightening cycle to combat inflation. As of 2023, the policy interest rate is at 5%. The bank typically adjusts rates based on economic conditions, inflation targets, and growth projections. By August 2024, there's a significant chance that inflationary pressures might have eased, potentially prompting a rate cut. However, this depends on various economic factors that are difficult to predict over a year in advance. Given the typical economic cycle and the high current rates, I'd estimate the probability of a rate cut announcement by August 2024 at around 60%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.40 + 0.60 - (0.40 * 0.60) = 0.76 or 76%.

Work requirements: Medicaid plans with work requirements have been controversial and have faced legal challenges in other states. They often result in lower enrollment numbers compared to traditional Medicaid expansion. 3. Legal and federal interventions: The question notes that legal challenges or federal interventions could alter the plan's structure. The Biden administration has generally opposed work requirements for Medicaid, which increases the likelihood of federal intervention. 4. Historical context: Other states that have implemented work requirements for Medicaid have seen reduced enrollment. For example, Arkansas saw thousands lose coverage when it implemented work requirements. 5. Virginia's specific situation: Without more detailed information about Virginia's current Medicaid enrollment, outreach efforts, or the specifics of their work requirement plan, it's difficult to gauge how successful they might be in reaching this enrollment target. 6.

Legal precedent: The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 (Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization) has given states more leeway to restrict abortion. This could potentially favor the constitutionality of Louisiana's ban. 5. Judicial system in Louisiana: The state courts in Louisiana may be more inclined to rule in favor of restrictive abortion laws given the state's conservative leanings. 6. Potential challenges: However, even in a conservative state, there could be legal challenges based on state constitutional protections or other legal grounds that might delay or prevent a clear ruling on constitutionality. 7. Timing of court decisions: Court processes can be slow, and there's no guarantee that a final decision will be reached by the state courts and reported by major news sources within the given timeframe. 8. Possibility of appeals: If a lower court rules on the constitutionality, there may be appeals that could extend beyond the August 2024 deadline.

Economic recovery: China's economic recovery post-COVID has been slower than expected, which typically doesn't lead to high inflation. 3.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that China will experience a month-over-month inflation increase exceeding 0.5% in the given timeframe. The PBOC has been cautious with monetary policy, and the Chinese economy is still facing deflationary pressures. While stimulus measures and global factors could push inflation up, reaching a 0.5% monthly increase is a high bar. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) targets an inflation rate of around 3% annually. A 0.5% month-over-month increase would be significant, representing an annualized rate of about 6%, which is well above the target. However, given global economic uncertainties, supply chain issues, and potential recovery from COVID-19 impacts, such a spike is not impossible.

Let's examine each scenario: 1. Nigeria's Senate passing a major economic reform bill opposed by President Tinubu by August 2024: The likelihood of this happening seems relatively low for several reasons: - President Tinubu's party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), holds a majority in the Senate, making it difficult to pass legislation he opposes. - Tinubu is still in his first year of presidency (as of June 2024), and typically, there's a 'honeymoon period' where legislators are more likely to support the president's agenda. - Major economic reforms often take time to develop and pass, and the August 2024 deadline is relatively soon. - The requirement for the bill to be 'major' and explicitly opposed by Tinubu raises the bar for this condition. However, it's not impossible. Nigeria faces significant economic challenges, and there could be pressure for reforms that might not align with Tinubu's preferences. 2. Bayer allowing generic production of its cardiovascular drug by July 2024: This scenario seems more plausible: - Pharmaceutical companies sometimes allow generic production for various reasons, including corporate social responsibility, pressure from governments or NGOs, or as part of a broader market strategy. - The deadline (July 2024) gives Bayer a full year to make such a decision, which is a reasonable timeframe for corporate decision-making. - There's increasing global pressure on pharmaceutical companies to improve access to medicines, especially in developing countries. - Without knowing which specific cardiovascular drug is in question, it's possible that Bayer might be nearing the end of its patent protection period for this drug anyway. Given these considerations, the second scenario appears more likely than the first. However, it's important to note that we don't have specific information about Bayer's plans or the particular drug in question, which adds uncertainty. Considering both scenarios together, there's a moderate chance that at least one of these events could occur. The Bayer scenario seems more likely, but the Nigerian political scenario, while less probable, still adds to the overall likelihood of a 'YES' resolution."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.035696698460547766, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.008924174615136941, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2827974684988877, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current economic conditions: Indonesia, like many countries, has been facing inflationary pressures and economic challenges due to global factors such as supply chain disruptions and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2023, the central bank has been maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy to combat inflation. 2. Global economic trends: The global economic outlook for 2024 is uncertain, with many major economies potentially facing slowdowns or mild recessions. This could influence Indonesia's economic performance and monetary policy decisions. 3. Historical policy patterns: The Central Bank of Indonesia has shown a willingness to adjust its monetary policy in response to economic conditions. However, they tend to be cautious and data-driven in their approach. 4. Time frame: The question gives a relatively short time frame (about two months from the creation date to the resolution date) for a significant policy shift to occur. 5. Inflation targets: The central bank's primary mandate is to maintain price stability. If inflation shows signs of easing by mid-2024, it could create room for monetary easing. 6. External factors: Changes in policies of major central banks like the US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank could influence Indonesia's monetary policy decisions. 7. Domestic political considerations: 2024 is an election year in Indonesia, which could potentially influence economic policy decisions. Given these factors, I believe the probability of a new monetary easing policy being announced by August 2024 is relatively low, but not negligible. The short time frame is a significant constraint, and the central bank would likely need to see clear signs of easing inflationary pressures and economic slowdown to justify such a move.

(a) The Central Bank of Indonesia announcing a new monetary easing policy: The Central Bank of Indonesia (Bank Indonesia) has been known to adjust its monetary policy in response to economic conditions. However, predicting a specific policy change more than a year in advance is challenging. As of mid-2023, Indonesia's economy has been relatively stable, with inflation under control. Without a significant economic downturn or external shock, there might not be a strong impetus for monetary easing. The probability of this occurring by August 2024 is moderate, perhaps around 40-50%. (b) Singapore Straits Times Index reaching or exceeding 4,000 points: As of June 2023, the Straits Times Index (STI) is trading around 3,200-3,300 points. Reaching 4,000 points would require a significant increase of about 20-25%. While this is not impossible, it's a substantial move for a mature market index. The STI has not reached 4,000 points in its history, with its all-time high being around 3,900 in 2007. However, with over a year until the deadline and potential for economic recovery and growth, there's a reasonable chance it could happen. The probability for this event might be around 30-40%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. Using the higher end of our estimates (50% for the Indonesian policy change and 40% for the STI reaching 4,000), we get: 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20 or 20%. However, it's worth noting that these events are not entirely independent. A monetary easing policy in Indonesia could have some positive impact on the broader Southeast Asian economy, potentially boosting Singapore's stock market. This slight positive correlation might increase the joint probability slightly.

(a) Central Bank of Indonesia announcing a new monetary easing policy: The Central Bank of Indonesia, like many central banks, adjusts its monetary policy based on economic conditions. As of now (June 2023), Indonesia's economy is showing signs of resilience, with inflation gradually coming under control. However, global economic uncertainties and potential slowdowns in major economies could impact Indonesia's growth prospects. Given the timeframe (by August 2024), there's a moderate chance that economic conditions might necessitate a monetary easing policy. Factors that could lead to this include: 1. Global economic slowdown affecting Indonesia's export-oriented sectors 2. Persistent inflationary pressures easing, giving room for monetary easing 3.

WHO declaring the West Nile virus outbreak over by August 2024: West Nile virus is endemic in many parts of the world, and outbreaks occur seasonally. The WHO doesn't typically declare such outbreaks 'over' in the same way they might for more acute, time-limited outbreaks like Ebola. Instead, they monitor and report on the situation. The question doesn't specify a particular outbreak, making it less likely for a formal declaration to occur. The probability of this happening is quite low. 2. Land O'Frost recalling deli meats due to listeria by August 2024: Listeria outbreaks in deli meats are not uncommon. According to the CDC, deli meats are a known risk factor for listeria infections. Food recalls due to listeria contamination happen regularly in the food industry. Land O'Frost is a major producer of deli meats, which increases the chances of them being involved in a recall at some point. However, several factors reduce the likelihood of this specific event occurring: a) The time frame is relatively short (about 2 months from the question's creation date to the resolution date). b) Land O'Frost, being a large company, likely has stringent quality control measures in place. c) Not all listeria contaminations lead to recalls, especially if caught early in the production process. Considering these factors, the probability of a Land O'Frost recall due to listeria in this timeframe is moderate but not high. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. The West Nile virus declaration is very unlikely, while the Land O'Frost recall is moderately possible. Given the short timeframe and the specific conditions required, I would estimate the overall probability to be on the lower end of moderate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.004829745402157415, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0012074363505393537, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.11309462477484361, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, there are signs that inflation is cooling, which could lead to a pause or even a reversal in rate hikes by 2024. 3. Economic conditions: The US economy's performance, including GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation, will significantly influence mortgage rates. A slowdown in economic growth or a recession could lead to lower mortgage rates. 4. Housing market trends: The demand for housing and overall market conditions can affect mortgage rates. A cooling housing market might lead to lower rates to stimulate demand. 5. Global economic factors: International economic conditions and geopolitical events can influence US mortgage rates indirectly through their impact on the broader financial markets. 6. Historical trends: Mortgage rates have been historically low in recent years, and while they have increased, there's potential for them to decrease again if economic conditions warrant it. 7. Time frame: The question gives about 14 months for rates to fall below 5.0%, which is a reasonable amount of time for significant changes to occur in the mortgage market. Given these factors, there's a moderate chance that the 15-year mortgage rate could fall below 5.0% by August 2024.

There have been no indications of Harris running separately from Biden. 3. The Democratic Party is likely to support the incumbent ticket (Biden-Harris) for the 2024 election. 4. Even if there were to be a change, it would be extremely unusual for a Vice President to announce their own running mate, as this is typically done by the presidential candidate. (b) New Jersey conducting a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024: This scenario is more plausible, but still not highly likely: 1. New Jersey already has strong abortion protections in place. In January 2022, Governor Phil Murphy signed the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, which codified the right to abortion into state law. 2. Given the existing protections, there might not be an urgent need for a referendum specifically on abortion rights. 3. However, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, some states have been taking additional measures to protect abortion rights. 4. New Jersey has a history of being proactive on reproductive rights, so a referendum is not out of the question. 5. The timeframe (by August 2024) gives some time for such a referendum to be organized if deemed necessary. Considering both scenarios, the likelihood of either happening is relatively low.

This increases the likelihood of AI systems being involved in content distribution, including potential misinformation. 2. Previous instances of misinformation spread: Social media platforms have been criticized for spreading misinformation during past elections, such as the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. While these were not specifically attributed to AI systems, it shows the platforms' vulnerability to such issues. 3. Increased scrutiny on AI and elections: With the growing awareness of AI's potential impact on information dissemination, there's likely to be heightened scrutiny from election officials, researchers, and media outlets on how AI systems might influence election-related content. 4. Complexity of AI systems: The complexity and often opaque nature of AI algorithms make it challenging for platforms to fully control or predict their behavior, potentially leading to unintended consequences in content distribution. 5.

Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of such a report being made. The combination of increased AI usage, heightened scrutiny during a major election year, and the platforms' history with misinformation makes it quite possible that at least one major platform will be reported for AI-related election misinformation spread. However, the requirement for multiple credible sources and the specific mention of AI systems (not just general misinformation) slightly lowers the probability.

Social media companies have been under scrutiny for their role in spreading misinformation in past elections, and the integration of AI systems adds a new layer of complexity. Companies like Meta (Facebook) and Twitter (X) have already faced criticism for their content moderation practices.

Existing efforts: As of my last update, there were no widely reported ongoing efforts to put abortion rights on the ballot in Missouri. 5. Precedent: Other conservative states like Kansas and Kentucky have seen abortion rights referendums, showing it's possible even in traditionally anti-abortion states. 6. Difficulty of process: In Missouri, to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot requires collecting signatures equal to 8% of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in six of the state's eight congressional districts. This is a significant hurdle. 7. Opposition: Given the state's conservative leanings, there would likely be strong opposition to such a referendum, potentially slowing or blocking the process. 8. Urgency: With abortion currently heavily restricted in Missouri, there might be increased motivation among abortion rights activists to push for a referendum. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for a referendum to occur, it seems unlikely within the given timeframe. The short time frame, the difficulty of the process, and the state's conservative leanings are significant obstacles. However, the urgency of the issue and precedents in other conservative states provide some possibility."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "5f90713f-708f-4c6f-ac4f-1e164277fe87", "title": "Will the American Federation of Teachers endorse a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) publicly endorses a candidate for the 2024 United States presidential election.

There has been significant pressure from both pro-choice and pro-life groups to address the issue. However, as of now, there is no concrete announcement of a referendum scheduled for 2024. The process of organizing a statewide referendum is complex and time-consuming, typically requiring months of preparation.

Given that incumbent President Joe Biden is likely to be the Democratic nominee, and the AFT has previously supported him, there's a strong possibility they will endorse him again. Even if Biden doesn't run, the AFT is still likely to endorse whoever becomes the Democratic nominee before July 2024.

(a) Iowa's 6-week abortion ban being overturned by July 2024: Iowa's 6-week abortion ban, also known as the 'fetal heartbeat' law, has been a subject of legal challenges. In 2018, a similar law was struck down by the Iowa Supreme Court. However, in 2022, the same court reversed its decision, allowing for the possibility of such a ban. The current ban was signed into law in July 2023 but was quickly blocked by a district court judge. The case is likely to make its way to the Iowa Supreme Court again. Given the recent shift in the Iowa Supreme Court's stance and the current conservative majority, there's a significant chance that the ban could be upheld. However, legal challenges take time, and it's possible that the case might not be fully resolved by July 2024.

As of now (June 2023), the RBI has been maintaining a relatively hawkish stance due to persistent inflationary pressures. However, by July 2024, which is more than a year away, the economic landscape could change significantly. Factors that could lead to a rate cut: 1. Easing of inflationary pressures 2.

Factors supporting this possibility: 1. Growing awareness and concern about AI's energy consumption 2. Potential regulatory pressures or industry standards emerging 3. Oracle's commitment to sustainability and desire to maintain a positive public image 4. Technological advancements that might enable more energy-efficient AI operations. However, Oracle might also: 1. Focus on other sustainability measures not specifically related to AI 2. Already have efficient AI operations that don't require significant changes 3. Prioritize AI development and performance over energy efficiency. Given the increasing importance of sustainability in the tech sector and the specific focus on AI's energy consumption, there's a reasonable chance Oracle will make such an announcement. Combining these probabilities: For both events to occur, we need them to happen independently. The probability of the RBI rate cut seems slightly lower than Oracle's announcement.

California's leadership in EV adoption: California is at the forefront of electric vehicle adoption and has ambitious goals for transitioning to zero-emission vehicles. This makes it a prime candidate for federal support in this area. 2. Federal commitment to EV infrastructure: The Biden administration has shown a strong commitment to expanding EV infrastructure and manufacturing as part of its climate and economic policies. This includes significant funding allocations through various programs. 3. Recent history of federal grants: In recent years, there have been substantial federal investments in EV-related projects. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy announced $2.8 billion in grants for EV battery manufacturing and processing facilities across 12 states. 4. California's economic importance: As the largest state economy in the U.S. and a major hub for technology and innovation, California is likely to be a priority for federal investment in emerging industries like EVs. 5.

Historically, conservative states have been more likely to enact or maintain restrictions on transgender healthcare rather than modify or relax them. 2. Existing legislation: South Carolina already has restrictions in place for transgender youth healthcare. In 2023, the state enacted a law banning gender-affirming care for minors, including hormone therapy and surgeries. 3. Short timeframe: The question's resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is only about a month after the question's creation date. This leaves very little time for drafting, debating, and passing new legislation, especially considering the contentious nature of the topic. 4.

However, the overall trend in conservative states has been towards maintaining or increasing restrictions rather than relaxing them. 5.

Barring any unforeseen circumstances such as health issues or major policy disagreements, it's highly likely that Macklem will still be in his position by July 2024. Combining these factors: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs. The probability of Macklem remaining as Governor is very high, likely around 90-95%. The probability of the IBM layoffs meeting the specific criteria is lower, perhaps around 30-40%. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) P(A or B) = 0.35 + 0.925 - (0.35 * 0.925) = 0.95375.

As of now (June 2024), global economic trends are showing signs of slowing inflation and potential economic cooldown. Many central banks worldwide have been considering or implementing rate cuts to stimulate their economies. Chile, being an export-oriented economy, is likely to follow global trends to maintain competitiveness. However, the exact timing of such a move is uncertain. Given the timeframe (by August 2024), there's a moderate to high chance of this occurring.

As of mid-2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been maintaining higher interest rates to combat inflation, which typically puts pressure on home sales. Additionally, economic uncertainties and potential recessionary fears might lead to decreased home-buying activity. However, predicting two consecutive months of decline within a specific timeframe is challenging due to the housing market's complexity and potential seasonal fluctuations. Let's estimate this probability at 0.6 or 60%. For both events to occur, we need to calculate the joint probability. Assuming these events are independent (which is a simplification, as there might be some correlation due to global economic conditions), we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42 or 42%. This calculation suggests that the probability of both events occurring is moderate. However, we should consider that these events are not entirely independent, and there might be some positive correlation due to global economic trends affecting both Chile's monetary policy and the U.S. housing market.

As of now (June 2023), Chile's interest rate is relatively high at 11.25% to combat inflation. However, there's a global trend towards easing monetary policy as inflation pressures subside. Given the long timeframe (until August 2024), there's a reasonable chance that Chile might start reducing rates if inflation shows consistent signs of cooling. The probability of this happening is moderate to high, let's say around 60%. 2. U.S. previously occupied home sales showing a decline for two consecutive months by July 2024: The U.S. housing market is currently facing challenges due to high mortgage rates and limited inventory. However, predicting two consecutive months of decline over a year in advance is challenging. The housing market can be influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, interest rates, and government policies.

As of now (June 2023), Chile's interest rate is relatively high at 11.25% to combat inflation. However, there's a general expectation that as inflation comes under control, central banks will start easing their monetary policies.

The country has a large domestic market, a growing middle class, and ongoing economic reforms that support growth. Moreover, the government and the Reserve Bank of India have been implementing various measures to stimulate the economy and maintain growth. However, there are potential risks such as global economic slowdowns, geopolitical tensions, and domestic challenges like inflation. But given India's recent economic performance and growth trajectory, it seems unlikely that it would experience two consecutive quarters of negative growth by July 2024. Probability for (a): 0.85 (b) Swiss National Bank announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024: The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy to combat inflation. As of 2023, the SNB's policy rate was in positive territory after years of negative rates. The global trend has been towards higher interest rates to fight inflation. For the SNB to cut rates by July 2024, we would need to see a significant change in economic conditions, such as a sharp economic slowdown or a rapid decline in inflation. While it's possible that global economic conditions could change, prompting central banks to lower rates, it's not the most likely scenario in the short term. Moreover, the SNB is known for its conservative approach and tends to move more slowly than other central banks. Given these factors, an interest rate cut by July 2024 seems less likely than maintaining or even potentially increasing rates.

Indian economy avoiding recession by July 2024: The Indian economy has been one of the fastest-growing major economies in recent years. Despite global economic challenges, India has shown resilience. The IMF and World Bank have projected India's GDP growth to be around 6.1% to 6.3% for 2023-24. While there are challenges like inflation and global economic slowdown, the likelihood of India facing two consecutive quarters of negative growth by July 2024 seems low. The government's focus on infrastructure development, digital initiatives, and reforms are likely to support growth. Therefore, the probability of India avoiding a recession by July 2024 is quite high, perhaps around 0.9. 2. Swiss National Bank announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024: The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation. As of now, the SNB's policy rate is at 1.75%. The global trend is still leaning towards higher interest rates to control inflation. However, by July 2024, there's a possibility that inflationary pressures might ease, allowing central banks to consider rate cuts. The SNB is known for its cautious approach, and it might wait for clear signs of economic slowdown or deflationary pressures before cutting rates. Given the uncertainty and the SNB's historically conservative stance, the probability of a rate cut by July 2024 is moderate, perhaps around 0.4. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs. Using the probability rule for independent events, the probability of at least one of these events occurring is: 1 - (probability of neither event occurring) = 1 - ((1 - 0.9) * (1 - 0.4)) = 1 - (0.1 * 0.6) = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.

Current political landscape: Indiana is a predominantly conservative state with a Republican-controlled legislature and governor's office. Historically, the state has been more inclined to restrict abortion rights rather than protect them. 2. Recent legislation: In August 2022, Indiana passed a near-total abortion ban, which was later blocked by the courts. This indicates that the state government's stance is generally against expanding abortion rights. 3. Referendum process: Indiana does not have a process for citizen-initiated referendums at the state level. Any referendum would need to be approved by the state legislature, which is unlikely given its current composition. 4. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of August 2024, which is just over a year away. Organizing a statewide referendum, especially on such a contentious issue, typically requires significant time for legislative approval, planning, and implementation. 5. National trends: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, these have primarily been in more liberal-leaning states or through citizen-initiated processes. 6. Public opinion: While there may be some support for abortion rights among Indiana residents, it's unclear if this support is strong enough to pressure the conservative government into holding a referendum. 7. Legal challenges: The ongoing legal battles over Indiana's abortion laws might make legislators hesitant to put the issue to a public vote. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Indiana will conduct a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. The state's political leanings, the lack of a citizen-initiated referendum process, and the short time frame all work against this possibility.

The state has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which suggests a reluctance to increase state involvement in healthcare funding. 5. Constitutional amendment process: In Tennessee, amending the state constitution requires approval from both houses of the state legislature in two successive sessions, followed by a public referendum. This process is time-consuming and would be challenging to complete within the given timeframe if it hasn't already started. 6.

Traditionally, running mates are announced just before or during the convention. 4. Location specificity: The question requires the announcement to be made at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. While Charlotte is a significant city, there's no particular reason why it would be chosen for such an important announcement over other locations. 5. Announcement format: The requirement for Harris to personally announce her running mate at a rally is plausible, as this is a common format for such announcements. However, the specificity of the location and timing makes this less likely. 6.

Recent legislative actions: In January 2023, Minnesota passed the PRO Act, which codified abortion rights into state law. This indicates that there is already strong support for abortion rights in the state government. 3. Constitutional amendments in Minnesota: To amend the state constitution, which would be necessary for a referendum, both chambers of the legislature must pass the proposed amendment by a simple majority. Then, it goes to the voters in the next general election. 4. Timeline: The question asks about a referendum by August 2024, which is relatively soon. The next general election in Minnesota is in November 2024, which falls outside this timeframe. 5. Necessity: Given that abortion rights are already protected by state law through the PRO Act, there might be less urgency to hold a constitutional referendum. 6.

ECB's decision-making process: The ECB is known for its cautious approach and tends to move gradually. A rate cut by July 2024 would require a relatively rapid shift in policy direction. Potential economic shocks: Unforeseen economic events or crises could force the ECB to cut rates earlier than expected, but such scenarios are hard to predict and typically have a low probability. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that the ECB will maintain its current stance or begin signaling a potential easing cycle rather than actually implementing a rate cut by July 2024. The timeframe is relatively short for such a significant policy shift, especially considering the ECB's typically cautious approach. However, there is still a non-negligible chance of a rate cut occurring if inflation falls more rapidly than expected or if economic conditions deteriorate significantly, necessitating monetary policy support."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "17a326c2-20d3-4d4b-87b7-93610ad76436", "title": "Will both of the following occur by July 2024: (a) Rome announces plans to restrict short-term rental units, and (b) the European Central Bank announces an interest rate cut?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following occur by July 31, 2024: (a) The city government of Rome officially announces plans or regulations aimed at restricting or limiting the availability of short-term rental units within the city.

Cities like Barcelona, Amsterdam, and New York have already implemented restrictions. Rome, being a major tourist destination, is likely facing similar pressures. In fact, there have been discussions about such regulations in Rome previously.

The ECB has been in a tightening cycle to combat inflation, with its main refinancing operations rate currently at 4%. For the ECB to cut rates by July 2024, we would need to see a significant reduction in inflation and potentially signs of economic slowdown in the Eurozone. Current ECB projections suggest inflation will approach their 2% target by 2025. However, economic conditions can change rapidly. If inflation falls faster than expected or if there's a recession, the ECB might be prompted to cut rates. Given the current economic uncertainty and the time frame (about a year), there's a reasonable chance of a rate cut, but it's far from certain. I'd estimate the probability of an ECB rate cut by July 2024 at around 40%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.70 * 0.40 = 0.28 or 28%.

This makes it less likely for the state government to initiate a referendum to enshrine abortion rights. 2. Recent abortion legislation: In April 2022, Florida passed a law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which was later upheld by the state Supreme Court. This indicates a trend towards restricting abortion rights rather than protecting them. 3. Grassroots efforts: There have been some grassroots efforts to put abortion rights on the ballot in Florida. For example, the Florida Abortion Rights Amendment Initiative aimed to get a constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot. However, as of early 2023, this initiative faced significant challenges in gathering the required signatures and meeting legal requirements. 4. Time constraints: The question specifies August 2024 as the deadline. Organizing a statewide referendum requires significant time for planning, approval, and implementation. With just over a year left, the timeline is very tight. 5. Legal hurdles: Florida has strict requirements for getting initiatives on the ballot, including gathering a large number of signatures and getting approval from the state Supreme Court. These hurdles make it difficult to organize a referendum quickly. 6. National trends: While some states have held referendums on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v.

Current economic situation in China: China's economy has been facing challenges, including a property sector crisis, deflationary pressures, and slower-than-expected post-COVID recovery. These factors might prompt the PBoC to consider monetary easing. 2. Recent policy trends: The PBoC has already shown a willingness to support the economy. In June 2023, it cut key rates, including the medium-term lending facility rate and the seven-day reverse repo rate. This indicates a bias towards monetary easing. 3. Global economic context: Global economic growth is expected to slow in 2024, which could impact China's export-oriented economy.

Inflation outlook: China has been experiencing deflationary pressures, which gives the PBoC more room to cut rates without worrying about inflation. 5.

Government priorities: The Chinese government has emphasized economic stability and growth, which aligns with potential rate cuts to stimulate the economy. 7. Previous patterns: The PBoC has a history of making multiple rate adjustments when deemed necessary, suggesting that further cuts are possible following the June 2023 reduction. However, we should also consider potential counterarguments: 1. The PBoC might prefer other policy tools to stimulate the economy, such as adjusting reserve requirements or targeted lending programs. 2. If the economy shows significant improvement in the coming months, the need for rate cuts might diminish. 3. Unexpected global events or changes in the domestic economic situation could alter the PBoC's policy trajectory. Given these factors, I believe there is a relatively high likelihood of the PBoC announcing a rate cut by August 2024.

Historical context: Massachusetts has been progressive in raising its minimum wage. The state has gradually increased its minimum wage from $11 in 2018 to $15 in 2023, showing a commitment to higher wages. 3. Political climate: Massachusetts is generally considered a liberal state with a history of supporting worker-friendly policies. This political environment makes it less likely for the state to reduce minimum wages. 4. Economic factors: While economic downturns could potentially lead to pressure to reduce minimum wages, the relatively short timeframe (about a year) makes significant economic changes less likely to impact this policy. 5. Legislative process: Any change to the minimum wage would require legislative action, which takes time. With the resolution date being July 31, 2024, there's limited time for any potential reduction to be proposed, debated, passed, and implemented. 6. Nationwide trends: The trend across the United States has been towards increasing minimum wages, not decreasing them. It would be unusual for a state, especially a progressive one like Massachusetts, to buck this trend. 7. Public opinion: Reducing the minimum wage would likely face significant public opposition, making it politically risky for lawmakers to attempt such a move. 8.

This timing increases the likelihood of election-related misinformation. Given the rapid development of AI technologies, it's likely that new AI platforms will emerge by August 2024. Historical precedent shows that social media platforms have been implicated in spreading election misinformation in previous elections, suggesting AI platforms might face similar issues.

Similar cases in other states: Several states have faced legal challenges to their abortion bans, with mixed results. Some bans have been upheld, while others have been struck down. 6. Indiana's state courts: The composition and historical rulings of Indiana's state courts will play a crucial role. If the courts have a conservative lean, they may be more likely to uphold the ban. 7.

Indiana has a Republican-controlled legislature and a conservative-leaning judiciary. However, abortion bans face significant legal challenges, and courts have been hesitant to uphold near-total bans in other states.

Historical context: Bird flu outbreaks can be persistent and challenging to control. Previous outbreaks have lasted for extended periods, sometimes years. 4. Global nature: Bird flu affects multiple countries and continents, making it more difficult to contain and declare over on a global scale. 5. WHO decision-making process: The WHO typically requires sustained evidence of containment and reduced transmission before declaring an outbreak over. This process can be lengthy and cautious. 6. Seasonal factors: Bird flu outbreaks can be influenced by seasonal migration patterns, which might affect the timing of any declaration. 7. Potential for new variants: The emergence of new variants could prolong the outbreak and delay any declaration of its end. 8. Public health measures: The effectiveness of ongoing containment efforts and vaccination programs will influence the timeline. 9. Political and economic pressures: There might be pressure to declare the outbreak over for economic reasons, but the WHO typically prioritizes public health concerns. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the WHO would declare the bird flu outbreak over by August 2024. The short timeframe (two months from the question's creation to the resolution date) is particularly concerning, as it doesn't allow much time for the situation to improve significantly and for the WHO to go through its thorough assessment process. However, there is always a possibility of rapid improvements in containment or unexpected breakthroughs in treatment or prevention that could accelerate the timeline. Additionally, if the outbreak has been showing signs of significant improvement prior to June 2024, the probability would increase. Considering all these factors, I would assign a low probability to this event occurring."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c9a3116d-0005-4b63-a48d-ff19672c9891", "title": "Will both of the following occur by August 2024: (a) The Singapore Straits Times Index reaches or exceeds 4,000 points and (b) The World Health Organization declares the current bird flu outbreak over?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following occur: (1) At any point between October 1, 2023 and August 31, 2024, the Singapore Straits Times Index reaches or exceeds 4,000 points.

The timeline for declaring an outbreak 'over' can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances. Given the complexity and widespread nature of this outbreak, I'd estimate the probability of the WHO declaring it over by August 2024 at about 40%. Combining probabilities: Since we need only one of these events to occur for a YES resolution, we can use the formula for the probability of at least one event occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

(a) Hyundai's quarterly net income increase: Hyundai is a major global automaker, and its performance can be influenced by various factors such as global economic conditions, competition, and industry trends. While a 20% year-over-year increase in quarterly net income is significant, it's not unprecedented for a large company like Hyundai. However, several challenges exist: 1. Global economic uncertainties: The automotive industry is sensitive to economic fluctuations. 2. Increasing competition: The auto market is highly competitive, especially with the rise of electric vehicles. 3. Supply chain issues: The industry has faced challenges with semiconductor shortages and other supply chain disruptions. On the positive side, Hyundai has been investing heavily in electric vehicles and has shown strong performance in recent years. They only need to achieve this 20% increase in one quarter out of the next four, which increases the likelihood. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Hyundai achieving a 20% year-over-year increase in quarterly net income by July 2024 at about 60%. (b) French economy avoiding a recession: France is one of the largest economies in the European Union, and its economic performance is influenced by various factors: 1. Global economic conditions: Any global slowdown could impact France. 2. European Union policies: Monetary and fiscal policies at the EU level affect France's economy. 3. Domestic factors: Political stability, labor market conditions, and consumer confidence play crucial roles. France has shown resilience in recent years, but economic challenges persist: 1. High inflation rates in Europe could lead to tighter monetary policy, potentially slowing growth. 2. Energy prices and supply uncertainties due to geopolitical tensions could impact economic performance. 3. However, the French government has implemented measures to support the economy and boost growth. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of France avoiding a recession by July 2024 at about 70%.

Let's analyze each separately: a) Hyundai's quarterly net income increasing by over 20% year-over-year: Hyundai is a major global automotive manufacturer, and its performance can be influenced by various factors such as global economic conditions, consumer demand, and industry trends. While a 20% increase in net income is significant, it's not uncommon for large companies to experience such growth, especially if they're recovering from a downturn or launching successful new products. However, given the current global economic uncertainties and potential challenges in the automotive industry (such as supply chain issues and the transition to electric vehicles), achieving this level of growth might be challenging. b) The French economy avoiding a recession: France is one of the largest economies in the European Union and has shown resilience in the past. However, like many other countries, it faces economic challenges due to factors such as inflation, energy costs, and global economic uncertainties. The European Central Bank has been implementing monetary tightening policies to combat inflation, which could potentially slow economic growth. Despite these challenges, France has a diverse economy and strong institutions that could help it avoid a recession. Considering both conditions: 1. We only need one of these conditions to occur for the question to resolve as YES. 2. The timeframe (by July 2024) gives ample opportunity for either condition to be met. 3. While both conditions face challenges, they are not unrealistic outcomes. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderately high chance of at least one of these conditions being met.

For a strike to last that long, it would need to start very soon and be particularly contentious. 4. Current economic conditions: The airline industry has been recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there's generally a push for stability rather than disruption. This makes a prolonged strike less likely. 5. Labor laws and negotiation processes: In the US, there are multiple steps and cooling-off periods required before a strike can occur in the airline industry. This process typically takes months and involves federal mediation. 6. Union and airline motivations: Both unions and airlines typically try to avoid prolonged strikes due to the significant economic impact on both parties. There's usually strong motivation to reach an agreement. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that a strike would begin and last through August 2024.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Georgia will hold a referendum on voting rights by July 2024.

While it's not impossible, it would require a significant and rapid shift in the political landscape of Georgia."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "12e3b988-ff1e-4056-adb1-b6f9337e8a99", "title": "Will the Arkansas Senate pass a total abortion ban by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the Arkansas Senate successfully passes legislation enacting a total abortion ban.

This provides ample time for the legislature to act if they choose to do so. 5. Potential legal challenges: Any new abortion legislation is likely to face legal challenges, which might make legislators hesitant to pass additional laws while existing ones are being contested. 6. Public opinion: While Arkansas is a conservative state, extreme abortion bans can sometimes face pushback even in conservative areas. This could potentially influence legislators' decisions. 7. Election year considerations: 2024 is a presidential election year, which might impact legislative priorities and the willingness to take on controversial issues. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that the Arkansas Senate will pass a total abortion ban by July 2024. The state already has very restrictive abortion laws in place, which reduces the need for additional legislation. Moreover, with potential legal challenges to existing laws and the proximity to a major election, legislators might be hesitant to push for even stricter measures.

(a) NTT Group confirming a payment to a hacker to erase data: This scenario is quite specific and relatively rare. Companies are generally reluctant to admit to paying hackers, as it can encourage further attacks and potentially have legal implications. However, there have been cases where companies have made such admissions. The timeframe (by July 2024) gives about a year for such an event to occur, which is a considerable amount of time in the cybersecurity world.

As of mid-2023, the U.S. economy has shown resilience despite high inflation and interest rate hikes. While there are concerns about a potential recession, many economists believe that a \"soft landing\" is possible. The Federal Reserve has been carefully managing interest rates to control inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the labor market remains strong, and consumer spending has been robust. However, economic predictions over a year-long period are inherently uncertain, and there are still risks such as global economic slowdowns, geopolitical tensions, and potential financial sector stress that could lead to a recession.

Time frame: The resolution date is August 31, 2024, which is shortly before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Major budget decisions are often politically sensitive close to elections. 3. Magnitude of the cut: A 20% budget cut to the Department of Education is substantial and would likely face significant opposition from education advocates and many legislators. 4. Historical precedent: While there have been proposals to reduce the Department of Education's budget in the past, cuts of this magnitude are rare and have not successfully passed in recent years. 5. Public opinion: Education is generally viewed as an important issue by the American public, and significant cuts to education funding often face public backlash. 6. Bipartisan support: Such a significant cut would likely require bipartisan support, which is challenging to achieve in the current polarized political climate. 7. Economic factors: The state of the economy and federal budget deficit in 2024 could influence decisions on department budgets, but it's unlikely to lead to such a drastic cut in education specifically. 8. Potential for compromise: Even if there is a push for education budget cuts, the legislative process often results in compromises that reduce the magnitude of proposed changes.

U.S. Senate passing a bill to cut the Department of Education's budget by more than 20% by August 2024: - This is a significant budget cut that would likely face strong opposition, especially from Democrats. - The current political climate and divided government make it challenging to pass such drastic measures. - Education is generally a priority for both parties, making substantial cuts less likely. - Historical precedent shows that such large budget cuts to major departments are rare. - The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for such a significant policy change. 2. Stanford University fully covering tuition for undergraduate students from lower-income families by July 2024: - Many top universities have been expanding their financial aid programs in recent years. - Stanford is one of the wealthiest universities in the world, with a large endowment. - There's increasing pressure on elite institutions to improve accessibility and affordability. - Stanford already has generous financial aid policies, making this extension plausible. - The specified income threshold ($100,000) is relatively high, which might make implementation more challenging. - The timeframe (by July 2024) is reasonable for implementing such a policy if it's already under consideration. Considering these factors, the second event (Stanford's tuition coverage) seems more likely than the first (Senate budget cut). However, neither event is highly probable within the given timeframe. For the Senate budget cut, I would estimate a very low probability, around 5-10%. For Stanford's tuition coverage, I would estimate a higher but still moderate probability, around 30-40%.

Recent history: In 2023, the Florida Supreme Court struck down state laws that regulated abortion providers more strictly than other healthcare providers and banned a common second-trimester procedure. This indicates a relatively recent shift towards less restrictive abortion laws in Florida. 2. Time frame: The question asks about the situation by July 2024, which is only about a year from the 2023 decision. Supreme Court decisions, especially on such contentious issues, are not typically reversed or significantly altered in such a short time frame unless there are extraordinary circumstances. 3. Composition of the Florida Supreme Court: The court's composition plays a crucial role in its decisions. Without information about any upcoming changes in the court's makeup, it's reasonable to assume that the justices who made the 2023 decision will likely maintain their positions and views. 4. Political climate: Florida has been known for its conservative leanings, but the 2023 decision suggests a possible shift in the state's approach to abortion rights. Without significant political upheaval or a change in the state's government, it's unlikely that there would be enough pressure to prompt the court to reverse its decision so quickly. 5. Legal precedent: Courts generally respect their own recent precedents unless there are compelling reasons to overturn them. The 2023 decision is very recent, making it less likely to be overturned in just a year. 6. Public opinion: While public opinion can influence legal decisions over time, it typically doesn't cause rapid shifts in court rulings, especially at the Supreme Court level. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Florida will maintain its current legal stance on abortion access by July 2024. The recent nature of the 2023 decision, the typically slow pace of significant legal changes, and the respect for legal precedent all point towards maintaining the status quo in the short term. However, it's important to note that abortion law is a highly contentious and rapidly evolving area of jurisprudence in the United States.

(a) Georgia holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024: Georgia is a traditionally conservative state, and there hasn't been any significant push for a statewide referendum on abortion rights. The timeframe is relatively short (about a year), and organizing a statewide referendum requires substantial political will, resources, and time. There are no current indications or reports suggesting that Georgia is planning such a referendum. Given the conservative nature of the state, it's more likely that any potential referendum would aim to restrict abortion rights rather than enshrine them. The probability of this condition being met seems very low, perhaps around 5%. (b) Florida maintaining its current legal stance on abortion access: The Florida Supreme Court's 2023 decision struck down stricter regulations on abortion providers and banned a common second-trimester procedure. Florida has a conservative-leaning government and Supreme Court, which might be inclined to revisit this decision. However, court decisions, especially at the Supreme Court level, are not frequently overturned in such a short timeframe unless there's a significant change in circumstances or court composition. The question specifically asks about maintaining the current stance, which is more likely than a reversal. The probability of this condition being met is moderately high, perhaps around 70%. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.05 * 0.70 = 0.035 or 3.5%.

Organizing a statewide referendum on a contentious issue like abortion rights typically requires significant lead time for legislative approval, public debate, and logistical preparations.

The Florida Supreme Court's 2023 decision striking down stricter regulations on abortion providers and banning a common second-trimester procedure was a significant ruling.

Moreover, the process of bringing a case to the state Supreme Court, having it heard, and receiving a decision usually takes considerable time.

While coriander is a commonly used spice, it's not as widely consumed as some other spices, which might make contamination less likely to be detected quickly. 4. Lead contamination in spices: Lead contamination in spices is a known issue. Spices can become contaminated with lead through various means, including soil contamination, processing, or packaging. However, it's not an extremely common occurrence. 5. FDA monitoring: The FDA does conduct regular testing and monitoring of food products, including spices, for contaminants. However, given the vast number of food products on the market, it's not guaranteed that ground coriander would be tested within this specific timeframe. 6.

The timeframe of about 14 months (from now until August 2024) provides a reasonable window for such an event to potentially occur.

(b) FDA recall of ground coriander due to lead contamination by July 2024: Lead contamination in spices, including coriander, has been a concern in recent years. The FDA regularly tests spices for heavy metal contamination. However, recalls specifically for ground coriander due to lead are not extremely common. The timeframe here is slightly shorter (about 13 months), which reduces the likelihood somewhat. Considering the FDA's focus on food safety and the known risks associated with spices, I'd estimate the probability of this event at around 20%.

Columbus Craft Meats salami recall due to listeria: Listeria outbreaks in ready-to-eat meats like salami are not uncommon. However, Columbus Craft Meats is a reputable company with likely stringent food safety measures. The timeframe (about 14 months from the question's creation date) is relatively short for a specific outbreak to occur and be traced to this particular company. Historical data suggests that major meat recalls due to listeria happen every few years, but not necessarily to the same company. The probability of this specific event occurring is relatively low, perhaps around 10-15%. 2. FDA recall of ground coriander due to lead contamination: Lead contamination in spices, particularly those imported from certain countries, has been a recurring issue. Coriander, being a commonly used spice, could potentially be subject to such contamination. The FDA regularly tests and recalls spices for various contaminants, including heavy metals. The timeframe for this event (about 13 months) is reasonable for such a recall to occur. Given the FDA's increased focus on food safety and the history of similar recalls, this scenario seems more likely than the first, perhaps around 20-25%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the principle of probability of either event occurring, we calculate: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) Assuming the events are independent (which is reasonable given their different nature): P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) Let's use the higher end of our estimates: P(A) = 0.15 (Columbus Craft Meats recall) P(B) = 0.25 (FDA coriander recall) P(A or B) = 0.15 + 0.25 - (0.15 * 0.25) = 0.3625 This calculation suggests a probability of about 36.25% that at least one of these events will occur."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.12874647934270475, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Recent history: Wisconsin has not held a statewide referendum on abortion rights in recent years, which suggests that this is not a common practice in the state. 3. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of July 31, 2024, which is about a year from the creation date. This is a relatively short time frame to organize a statewide referendum, especially on such a contentious issue. 4. Legal framework: Wisconsin's current abortion law is based on an 1849 statute that bans most abortions. There has been ongoing debate and legal challenges regarding this law, which could potentially lead to calls for a referendum. 5. National trends: Several other states have held referendums on abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. This national trend could influence Wisconsin's decision-making. 6. Public opinion: Wisconsin's population is divided on the issue of abortion rights, which could lead to pressure from both sides to hold a referendum. 7. Legislative process: Initiating a referendum typically requires legislative action, which can be a complex and time-consuming process, especially in a divided government. 8. Election year considerations: 2024 is a presidential election year, which could either motivate politicians to put the issue on the ballot to drive voter turnout or discourage them from doing so to avoid polarization. Given these factors, while there is some potential for a referendum to occur, the short time frame, the state's political division, and the lack of recent precedent for such referendums in Wisconsin make it less likely.

However, gun control is a contentious issue in the U.S., and there's ongoing debate about measures to reduce gun violence. The timeframe (by August 2024) gives some time for legislative processes to occur, but it's relatively short for significant policy changes. The specific requirement of a 72-hour waiting period (not longer or shorter) makes this condition more restrictive. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring as relatively low, around 20-25%. b) New York conducting a referendum on abortion rights: New York is known for its progressive stance on abortion rights, having already passed the Reproductive Health Act in 2019 to protect abortion rights. However, conducting a referendum specifically on this issue is a significant step that would require substantial political will and resources. The timeframe (by August 2024) includes a major election year, which could potentially increase the likelihood of such a referendum being proposed as a political strategy. New York has not frequently used statewide referendums for policy decisions, which slightly reduces the likelihood. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring as moderate, around 30-35%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), and using the higher end of our estimates: P(YES) = 0.25 + 0.35 - (0.25 * 0.35) = 0.5125.

However, building new nuclear reactors is a complex, expensive, and time-consuming process that often faces public opposition and regulatory hurdles.

(b) The U.S. Senate passing a bill to cut the Pentagon's budget by more than 20% by August 2024: Cutting the Pentagon's budget by more than 20% would be a drastic measure. There is some bipartisan support for defense spending, and significant cuts are often met with strong resistance. The U.S. faces ongoing global security challenges, which typically justify maintaining or increasing defense spending. Such a substantial cut would be highly unusual and goes against historical trends. The timeframe (by August 2024) is very short for such a significant policy change, especially considering it's an election year. Estimated probability for (b): 0.05.

The current administration has been supportive of nuclear energy, but there are only two months left until the July 2024 deadline for this announcement.

(b) U.S. Senate passing a bill to cut the Pentagon's budget by more than 20%: This scenario is highly unlikely for several reasons: 1. The U.S. military budget has historically been a priority for both major political parties. 2. A 20% cut would be an unprecedented and drastic reduction. 3.

AI-focused reorganization: Microsoft has been heavily investing in AI, particularly with its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI into its products. This focus on AI could lead to restructuring in various departments. 3. Time frame: The question asks about layoffs by July 2024, which is about a year from the creation date of the question.

Economic factors: The tech industry has been experiencing some volatility, with many companies conducting layoffs to streamline operations and reduce costs. 5. Specificity of the question: The question requires at least 1,800 layoffs explicitly linked to the AI-focused reorganization plan announced in 2023. This is a specific criterion that narrows the scope of what qualifies as a 'yes' resolution. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability that Microsoft will lay off at least 1,800 employees by July 2024 as part of its AI-focused reorganization: - Microsoft has shown a willingness to conduct large-scale layoffs in the past. - The company's focus on AI is likely to lead to significant restructuring across various departments. - The tech industry's current climate makes further layoffs plausible. However, there are also factors that reduce the probability: - The specific requirement of linking the layoffs to the AI reorganization plan may make it less likely to meet the criteria. - Microsoft may choose to reallocate employees rather than conduct layoffs, especially given the value of retaining talent in a competitive AI landscape. - The company might implement smaller, phased layoffs that don't reach the 1,800 threshold by the specified date.

If inflation shows signs of consistently decreasing towards the target rate of 3% (\u00b11%), it could pave the way for rate cuts. 3. Global economic trends: The actions of major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, influence Mexico's monetary policy.

Given these factors, there's a reasonable chance that the Bank of Mexico will announce a rate cut by August 2024.

Given this recent history and the ongoing AI transformation, it's quite plausible that Microsoft might conduct another round of layoffs by July 2024.

(a) Dream Chaser crewed return mission from ISS: The Dream Chaser spacecraft, developed by Sierra Nevada Corporation, has been in development for several years. However, as of now, it has not yet conducted any crewed missions. The first uncrewed cargo mission to the ISS is scheduled for 2024, but there are no firm plans for crewed missions in the near future. Given the complexity of space missions and the rigorous testing required, it seems highly unlikely that Dream Chaser would progress from its first uncrewed mission to a full crewed return mission from the ISS within the same year. The timeline is very tight, and there are often delays in space programs. I would estimate the probability of this occurring by August 31, 2024, to be very low, around 5%. (b) New form of cooperation between US and South Korea: The United States and South Korea have a long-standing alliance and cooperate in various fields, including defense, economy, and technology. Given the dynamic nature of international relations and the constant need for adaptation to new challenges, it's quite likely that these two countries would implement a new form of cooperation within the given timeframe. The broad definition of 'new form of cooperation' in the question allows for various possibilities, from technological collaborations to cultural exchanges. Considering the strong ties between the two nations and their history of frequent collaborative initiatives, I would estimate the probability of this occurring by July 31, 2024, to be relatively high, around 75%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either (a) or (b) occurs.

Current legal situation: Bankman-Fried is already facing multiple criminal charges related to the collapse of FTX, his cryptocurrency exchange. He was found guilty on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy in November 2023 and is awaiting sentencing. 2. Financial status: Given the collapse of FTX and the ongoing legal proceedings, it's likely that Bankman-Fried's personal finances have been severely impacted. However, the extent of his remaining assets or debts is not entirely clear. 3. Existing bankruptcy proceedings: FTX and its affiliated companies are already undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. This question specifically asks about new, separate proceedings against Bankman-Fried personally. 4. Time frame: The period in question is relatively short, from now until July 31, 2024. 5. Creditors' actions: There's a possibility that creditors who believe Bankman-Fried owes them money personally (separate from FTX) might file for involuntary bankruptcy against him. 6. Legal strategy: Bankman-Fried or his legal team might consider voluntary bankruptcy as a strategy to manage personal debts or liabilities, although this seems less likely given the ongoing criminal proceedings. Given these factors, I believe the probability of new bankruptcy proceedings against Sam Bankman-Fried by July 2024 is relatively low, but not negligible. The main reasons for this assessment are: - The existing criminal proceedings and potential sentencing are likely to take precedence over new bankruptcy filings. - Most of the financial issues are probably being addressed through the existing FTX bankruptcy proceedings. - The short time frame reduces the likelihood of new proceedings being initiated. However, there are factors that could increase the probability: - Potential creditors might seek to file involuntary bankruptcy to recover personal debts. - New information about Bankman-Fried's personal finances might come to light, prompting legal action.

Kamala Harris is currently the Vice President and is expected to run alongside Joe Biden for re-election in 2024. 2. There have been no indications of Harris running separately from Biden or planning to announce a running mate of her own. 3. The Democratic Party is likely to support the incumbent President Biden for re-election, making it improbable for Harris to run independently. 4.

Current economic conditions: Israel's economy has been relatively strong, but there are signs of slowing growth and inflationary pressures. As of 2023, inflation has been above the central bank's target range. 2. Interest rate history: The Bank of Israel has been raising interest rates to combat inflation. As of mid-2023, the key interest rate was at its highest level in over a decade. 3. Global economic trends: Global economic conditions, including actions by major central banks like the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, influence Israel's monetary policy. 4. Time frame: The question asks about a reduction by August 2024, which is more than a year from now. This provides ample time for economic conditions to change. 5. Inflation expectations: If inflation shows signs of moderating, it could prompt the central bank to consider rate cuts. 6. Economic growth concerns: If economic growth slows significantly, it might encourage rate cuts to stimulate the economy. Given these factors, there are arguments both for and against a rate cut by August 2024: For a rate cut: - The extended time frame allows for potential changes in economic conditions. - If inflation moderates, there may be room for rate cuts. - Global economic pressures might necessitate monetary easing. Against a rate cut: - The current high inflation environment may persist. - The central bank might prefer to maintain higher rates to ensure price stability. - Economic growth might remain robust enough to not warrant rate cuts. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut by August 2024.

Historical context: HDFC Bank has faced regulatory actions from RBI in the past. In December 2020, RBI temporarily halted HDFC Bank's digital launches and new credit card issuances due to repeated tech outages. This ban was lifted in August 2021 after the bank took corrective measures. 2. Recent merger: In July 2023, HDFC Bank completed its merger with HDFC Ltd., creating one of India's largest banks. Such a significant change in the bank's structure and size might attract additional regulatory scrutiny. 3. RBI's focus on financial stability: The RBI has been increasingly vigilant about the stability of large financial institutions, especially after recent global banking crises. As HDFC Bank is now even larger post-merger, it may be subject to more stringent oversight. 4. Compliance track record: While HDFC Bank has generally maintained a good reputation, the previous digital banking issues suggest that there might be areas where the bank needs to improve its compliance and risk management. 5. Time frame: The question allows for more than a year (from October 2023 to August 2024) for new curbs to be imposed, which is a considerable period in regulatory terms. 6. Economic conditions: India's economic situation and any potential banking sector stress in the coming year could influence RBI's regulatory approach. 7. HDFC Bank's performance: Any issues in HDFC Bank's operations, risk management, or compliance in the coming months could trigger regulatory action. Given these factors, there is a non-trivial chance that the RBI might impose new regulatory curbs on HDFC Bank's lending.

The global economic situation and inflation trends will play a crucial role in this decision.

Central Bank of Israel reducing its key interest rate: The global economic landscape is currently facing inflationary pressures, and many central banks have been raising interest rates to combat inflation. However, by August 2024, which is more than a year away, the economic situation could change. Israel's economy is relatively stable, but it's not immune to global economic trends. If global inflation starts to ease, there might be room for interest rate cuts. However, central banks are typically cautious and slow to reduce rates. The probability of this happening within the given timeframe is moderate. 2. Reserve Bank of India imposing new regulatory curbs on HDFC Bank's lending: HDFC Bank is one of India's largest private sector banks and has generally maintained a good reputation. However, regulatory scrutiny in the banking sector is common, especially for large institutions. The RBI has imposed restrictions on banks in the past when it identified issues with their operations. That said, imposing new curbs specifically on HDFC Bank would be a significant move that would likely only occur if there were serious concerns about the bank's practices. Without any current indications of major issues at HDFC Bank, the probability of this happening is relatively low. Combining these factors: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs, which increases the overall probability.

Recent developments: In recent years, there have been increasing calls to regulate or shut down POGOs due to concerns about money laundering, tax evasion, and human trafficking. However, no decisive action has been taken yet. 3. Economic considerations: POGOs contribute significantly to the Philippine economy, particularly in the real estate sector. A sudden shutdown could have negative economic impacts, which might make the government hesitant. 4. Diplomatic relations: The relationship between the Philippines and China could influence this decision. A complete shutdown might strain diplomatic ties. 5.

Recent history: Microsoft has a history of significant layoffs. In January 2023, the company announced 10,000 job cuts, which was about 5% of its workforce. This shows that Microsoft is not averse to large-scale layoffs when deemed necessary. 2. AI focus: Microsoft has been heavily investing in AI, particularly with its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI into its products. This shift in focus could lead to restructuring in other areas of the company. 3. Time frame: The question gives a relatively short time frame (about a month from the creation date to the resolution date). This tight timeline might make it less likely for a large-scale layoff to be planned and executed. 4. Economic conditions: The tech industry has been experiencing some volatility, with many companies implementing cost-cutting measures. However, Microsoft has been performing well financially, which might reduce the pressure for immediate large-scale layoffs. 5. Reorganization plans: The question specifically mentions an 'AI-focused reorganization plan announced in 2023.' This suggests that Microsoft has already communicated its intentions to restructure, which increases the likelihood of layoffs occurring. 6.

Inflation trends: If inflation shows signs of cooling down by early 2024, it could pave the way for rate cuts. However, this would require a sustained downward trend in inflation over several months. Global economic context: The decisions of major central banks, particularly the U.S. Federal Reserve, influence Mexico's monetary policy. If global economic conditions improve and other central banks start cutting rates, it could provide room for Mexico to follow suit. Time frame: The question asks about a rate cut by July 2024, which gives the central bank about a year from the current date to make this decision. This is a reasonable timeframe for economic conditions to potentially change. Historical precedent: The Central Bank of Mexico has shown willingness to adjust rates in response to changing economic conditions. However, they tend to be cautious and data-dependent in their approach. Policy lag: Central banks typically wait to see the full effects of their previous policy decisions before making new ones.

In January 2023, Microsoft announced 10,000 job cuts, and in July 2023, they laid off an additional 1,900 employees from their gaming division. Given this recent history and the ongoing AI transformation, it's plausible that Microsoft could announce another round of layoffs specifically tied to AI reorganization. However, the requirement for at least 1,800 employees to be laid off is a substantial number, and it's not certain that Microsoft will need to make such a large cut again within a year. The probability of this occurring is moderate, perhaps around 40-50%. (b) Central Bank of Mexico interest rate cut: As of June 2023, Mexico's central bank (Banxico) has kept its benchmark interest rate at 11.25%, which is quite high. The bank has indicated that it may consider rate cuts in the future if inflation continues to decline. However, several factors need to be considered: 1. Inflation in Mexico is still above the bank's target. 2. Global economic uncertainties may influence the bank's decision. 3. The timeframe (by July 2024) gives the bank a full year to make this decision, which increases the likelihood. Given these factors, the probability of an interest rate cut by July 2024 is relatively high, perhaps around 70-80%. Combining probabilities: For both events to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. Using the middle of our estimated ranges: (45% * 75%) = 33.75%. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent. A global economic slowdown could potentially trigger both Microsoft layoffs and a Mexican interest rate cut, slightly increasing the joint probability.

However, there's been growing pushback against these restrictions: - In 2022, there was an effort to gather signatures for a ballot initiative to protect abortion rights, but it didn't make it to the ballot. - As of 2023, there are ongoing efforts by abortion rights advocates to put the issue on the 2024 ballot. - The deadline for submitting signatures for the 2024 ballot is typically in May, which would allow enough time for a referendum by August 2024. - However, Missouri has a complex process for getting initiatives on the ballot, including legal challenges that could delay or prevent a referendum. 2. Tennessee referendum on labor laws: - Tennessee is a 'right-to-work' state with generally business-friendly labor laws. - There hasn't been significant public discussion or movement towards a labor law referendum in Tennessee. - Tennessee's process for getting referendums on the ballot is also complex and time-consuming. - As of now, there are no known major campaigns or legislative efforts pushing for such a referendum. Considering these factors: - The Missouri abortion rights referendum seems more likely than the Tennessee labor law referendum. - There is active effort and public interest in the Missouri case, but significant hurdles remain. - The Tennessee scenario appears much less likely due to lack of current momentum or public discourse on the issue. - The timeframe (by August 2024) provides some opportunity for these events to occur, but it's relatively short for organizing and implementing a statewide referendum, especially if not already in progress.

While there are expectations that the ECB might start cutting rates in 2024, the timing is uncertain. Several factors suggest a potential rate cut by August 2024: 1. Inflation is expected to continue moderating through 2023 and 2024. 2. Economic growth in the Eurozone may slow, potentially necessitating monetary easing. 3. Other major central banks (e.g., the Federal Reserve) may begin cutting rates, putting pressure on the ECB to follow suit.

(a) European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate cut announcement by August 31, 2024: The ECB has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation. As of June 2023, the ECB's main refinancing rate is at 4.00%, which is historically high. However, by August 2024, more than a year will have passed, and the economic landscape could change significantly. Factors to consider: 1. Inflation trends: If inflation shows consistent signs of cooling down, the ECB might consider rate cuts. 2. Economic growth: If the Eurozone faces economic slowdown or recession, it could prompt rate cuts. 3. Global economic conditions: Changes in major economies like the US or China could influence ECB's decision. 4. Geopolitical factors: Ongoing conflicts or new geopolitical tensions could impact economic outlook. Given the extended timeframe and the cyclical nature of monetary policy, there's a moderate chance the ECB might announce a rate cut by August 2024, especially if inflation pressures ease. However, the ECB is known for its cautious approach, which might delay such a decision. (b) Apple finalizing a union contract with store employees in Arizona by July 31, 2024: Apple has been resistant to unionization efforts in its stores. The first Apple store to unionize in the US was in Towson, Maryland, in June 2022. Since then, progress on union contracts has been slow. Factors to consider: 1. Current union activities: As of 2023, there's no public information about active unionization efforts in Arizona Apple stores. 2. Apple's stance: The company has shown resistance to unionization, which could slow down the process. 3. Legal and regulatory environment: Changes in labor laws or increased pressure from regulators could accelerate unionization. 4. Precedent: If other Apple stores successfully negotiate contracts, it could pave the way for Arizona. Given Apple's current stance and the lack of known unionization efforts in Arizona, the probability of this occurring by July 2024 seems relatively low. Combining these assessments: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. The ECB rate cut seems more likely than the Apple union contract in Arizona.

Florida has already shown interest in further restrictions, with a 6-week ban signed into law in April 2023, though it's currently not in effect. 3. Legal challenges: The 15-week ban is currently facing legal challenges. The Florida Supreme Court is reviewing the law's constitutionality under the state constitution's privacy clause. Their decision could significantly impact the law's status. 4. Timing: The question resolves in August 2024, which is after the 2024 legislative session and close to the 2024 elections. Major changes to abortion laws often happen during legislative sessions, which typically end earlier in the year. 5. Public opinion: Florida is a swing state with diverse views on abortion. Public opinion could influence lawmakers' decisions, especially close to an election year. 6. Potential for stricter laws: Given the 6-week ban already signed (but not in effect), there's a significant possibility that Florida might move to implement stricter abortion laws if legal hurdles are cleared. 7. Supreme Court decision timeline: The Florida Supreme Court's decision on the 15-week ban's constitutionality is crucial. If they uphold the law, it's more likely to remain unchanged. If they strike it down, changes are almost certain. The timing of this decision is uncertain but could come before August 2024. Considering these factors, there's a substantial chance that the law will change, either becoming more restrictive or being struck down. However, legal and legislative processes can be slow, and the proximity to the 2024 elections might make some lawmakers hesitant to push for changes."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6ebb3803-d2a7-4bba-a4fc-9dd8e6f0a15a", "title": "Will Wisconsin enact new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, Wisconsin enacts new laws or regulations that impose stricter requirements on abortion providers compared to other healthcare providers.

Part A: Florida's abortion law remaining unchanged by August 2024. The current situation shows that Florida's 15-week abortion ban is in effect, but it's being challenged in court. The political landscape is such that Florida has a Republican-controlled legislature and governor who support stricter abortion laws. Recent trends indicate a push for more restrictive abortion laws in Republican-controlled states after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Given that we have until August 2024, which is over a year away, there is ample time for potential changes to the law. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the law will remain unchanged, leading to an estimated probability for Part A of 0.3 (30% chance of remaining unchanged). Part B: Wisconsin enacting stricter abortion regulations by July 2024. The current situation shows that Wisconsin's abortion laws are contested, with an 1849 near-total ban. The political landscape features a Democratic governor who supports abortion rights, while the state legislature is controlled by Republicans. Recent trends show increased focus on abortion regulations in many states, including those with divided government. The timeframe until July 2024 allows for potential political maneuvering. However, the divided government in Wisconsin makes it less likely for extreme changes, although some additional regulations could potentially pass. The Democratic governor would likely veto any significantly stricter regulations, leading to an estimated probability for Part B of 0.4 (40% chance of enacting stricter regulations). Combining these probabilities (0.3 * 0.4) gives us a 0.12 probability, indicating a 12% chance that both conditions will be met.

However, with a conservative-leaning state government and Supreme Court, there's a significant chance this law could remain in place. The resolution date is relatively soon (about 14 months from now), which reduces the likelihood of major legislative changes. Still, there's always a possibility of court rulings or new legislation that could alter the law. 2. Wisconsin enacting stricter abortion regulations by July 2024: Wisconsin has a divided government, with a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature. This division makes it challenging to pass new abortion regulations. However, the state has a pre-Roe abortion ban that was recently reinstated, creating a complex legal landscape. There's potential for new regulations to be proposed or enacted, especially if there are changes in the political balance or public pressure. Considering both scenarios: - The Florida scenario seems more likely to occur, as maintaining the status quo is often easier than enacting new laws, especially in a state with aligned conservative leadership. - The Wisconsin scenario is less certain due to the political division, but not impossible given the state's complex abortion law history.

In 2022, they recalled about 239,000 cars due to seatbelt pretensioners that could explode and injure occupants. This shows they are willing to conduct large recalls when safety issues are identified. However, 720,000 is a significantly larger number. The automotive industry has been facing increased scrutiny on safety issues, and seatbelts are a critical safety component. If a widespread seatbelt issue is identified, it's likely Hyundai would act quickly to address it. Given the specific nature of the recall mentioned (seatbelts not properly securing passengers), it suggests there might be some information or investigation already underway.

However, $500 million is a significant amount for a single company. While the government has been supportive of EV initiatives, such a large grant to one company might be seen as favoritism.

The short timeframe makes this scenario less likely. (b) United Auto Workers endorsing Elizabeth Warren for president: Elizabeth Warren is not currently a declared candidate for the 2024 presidential election. While she has been a prominent figure in the Democratic party, she has not indicated any plans to run. The incumbent, Joe Biden, is likely to be the Democratic nominee. UAW typically endorses Democratic candidates, but they would be unlikely to endorse someone who isn't running. Furthermore, even if Warren were to make a surprise late entry into the race, it would be unusual for a major union to endorse a non-frontrunner this close to the election.

The Biden administration has shown a strong commitment to climate action, but reinstating the exact Clean Power Plan might be challenging due to several factors: a) The Supreme Court's 2022 decision in West Virginia v.

This suggests that either the outbreak hasn't reached a level of global concern yet, or it's being managed effectively. 2.

This is a relatively short period for a disease outbreak to escalate to global emergency status and then be declared no longer an emergency. 3. WHO's decision-making process: The WHO typically takes time to assess disease outbreaks before declaring them global emergencies, and even more time before declaring them no longer emergencies. Two months is a very short period for this process. 4. Historical context: Rift Valley fever outbreaks have occurred in East Africa before, but they haven't typically been declared global emergencies by the WHO. The disease is endemic to the region, and while outbreaks can be severe, they are often localized. 5. Lack of current global attention: The fact that this question is being asked suggests there might be some concern about a potential outbreak, but the lack of widespread media coverage or WHO statements about a current emergency indicates that the situation is not currently at a global emergency level. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the WHO would declare the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa no longer a global emergency by August 2024. The main reason for this is that it doesn't appear to be considered a global emergency at present, and the timeframe is too short for it to become one and then be declared over. However, there is a small chance that there is an ongoing situation that could be declared an emergency and then resolved quickly, or that a sudden outbreak occurs and is swiftly contained."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "b2e58b44-b2ff-44bb-ad66-13bee3f0f95d", "title": "Will Hormel Foods issue a recall of deli meats due to a listeria outbreak by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, Hormel Foods officially announces a recall of any of its deli meat products due to a listeria outbreak.

Hormel Foods issuing a recall of deli meats due to a listeria outbreak: - Listeria outbreaks in deli meats are not uncommon in the food industry. - Hormel Foods is a major producer of deli meats, which increases the potential for such an incident. - Food safety measures have improved over time, but recalls still occur periodically. - The timeframe of two months (from question creation to resolution) is reasonable for a potential listeria outbreak to be detected and a recall to be issued. Considering these factors: - The Rift Valley fever scenario seems less likely due to the short timeframe and the hypothetical nature of the outbreak. - The Hormel Foods listeria recall scenario is more plausible, given the nature of the food industry and the reasonable timeframe. Given that only one of these events needs to occur for a YES resolution, and the Hormel Foods scenario is more likely, I would estimate a moderate probability for this question resolving as YES."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.09208286172960677, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Oil prices: As Russia's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, fluctuations in oil prices could impact the ruble's stability and potentially trigger a need for intervention. 7. Domestic political considerations: The Russian government may push for currency stability to maintain public confidence, especially if there are any significant political events or elections approaching. However, there are also factors that could reduce the likelihood of such an announcement: 1.

Time frame: The question gives about a year for this announcement to happen, which is a reasonable amount of time for negotiating and finalizing a major partnership. 5. Market trends: There's a growing trend of tech companies entering the sports broadcasting space, which could encourage Meta to follow suit. 6. Meta's financial position: Meta has the financial resources to invest in such partnerships if they choose to do so. 7. Potential benefits: A major sports partnership could help Meta attract users to its platforms and potentially boost its metaverse ambitions. However, there are also factors that might decrease the likelihood: 1. Meta's recent focus on AI and the metaverse might mean sports partnerships are not a top priority. 2. The company has faced some financial challenges and layoffs recently, which might make them more cautious about major new investments. 3. Many major sports rights are locked up in long-term deals, potentially limiting immediate opportunities. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of Meta announcing a major sports media partnership by July 2024. While they have the resources and potential motivation to pursue such a deal, it's not certain that they will prioritize this over other strategic initiatives. The timeframe of about a year provides a reasonable window for such an announcement, but it's not guaranteed."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "92193eba-208e-4a9a-af60-59e1ab501d1a", "title": "Will Facebook and Twitter receive final regulatory approval for their proposed merger by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by August 31, 2024, Facebook and Twitter receive final regulatory approval from all necessary U.S. government agencies for their proposed merger.

Spain was one of the most affected countries in Europe during the 2022 outbreak, but cases have dropped dramatically since then. 2.

Time frame: The question allows for a full year (from July 2023 to July 2024) for the outbreak to be declared over, which is a considerable amount of time for further progress to be made. 5. Criteria for declaring an outbreak over: Typically, an outbreak is declared over after a certain period with no new cases. This period is usually twice the maximum incubation period of the disease.

Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa: Rift Valley fever is a viral disease that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans. Outbreaks are often associated with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding. The WHO has not currently declared the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa a global emergency, which makes it less likely that they would need to declare it 'no longer a global emergency' by August 2024. However, climate change and increasing extreme weather events could potentially lead to more severe outbreaks in the future. Given the timeframe (by August 2024) and the fact that there isn't currently a global emergency declaration, it seems relatively likely that this condition could be met. 2. Mpox outbreak in Spain: Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) outbreaks have been declining globally since their peak in 2022. Many countries have successfully controlled their outbreaks, and the WHO declared the global mpox outbreak was no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in May 2023. Spain was one of the countries affected by the 2022 outbreak, but like many European countries, it has seen a significant decline in cases. Given the current trend and the time frame (by July 2024), it seems highly likely that Spain will declare its mpox outbreak over by then, if it hasn't already done so.

The Central Bank of Turkey has been implementing various measures to control inflation, but progress has been slow. A monthly increase of 0.5% is relatively small compared to recent trends in Turkey.

In 2022, the state reverted to an 1849 law that banned nearly all abortions after Roe v. Wade was overturned. However, this law is currently being challenged in court. Given the state's political climate and the ongoing legal battles, it's plausible that Wisconsin might attempt to enact new, stricter regulations on abortion providers.

While there have been legal challenges to this law, Idaho is a conservative state with a history of supporting restrictive abortion laws.

The state legislature is controlled by Republicans, but any new restrictive abortion laws would likely be vetoed by Governor Evers.

The Idaho Supreme Court upheld the law in January 2023, but legal challenges continue. Given the ongoing legal battles and the potential for federal court intervention, there is a higher likelihood of this ban being overturned compared to the Wisconsin scenario. However, the conservative makeup of the federal judiciary, including the U.S. Supreme Court, makes it less likely that the ban will be overturned quickly. Considering both scenarios: The Wisconsin scenario has a low probability due to the political landscape and the governor's veto power. The Idaho scenario has a higher probability due to ongoing legal challenges, but still faces obstacles given the current judicial climate. Given that only one of these needs to occur for a YES resolution, the overall probability is increased.

For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.05 * 0.15 = 0.0075 or 0.75%.

Oklahoma's political climate: Oklahoma is a conservative state with a history of passing restrictive abortion laws. The state government is currently controlled by Republicans who generally support stricter abortion regulations. 2. Recent trends: In recent years, many conservative states have been enacting stricter abortion laws, especially following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. Oklahoma has been at the forefront of this trend. 3. Existing laws: Oklahoma already has some of the strictest abortion laws in the United States. In 2022, the state passed a near-total ban on abortions, making it illegal to perform an abortion at any stage of pregnancy, with few exceptions. 4. Time frame: The question asks about new regulations by July 2024, which is about a year from now. This provides ample time for the state legislature to propose and pass new regulations if they choose to do so. 5. Potential areas for new regulations: Given that abortion is already nearly banned in Oklahoma, new regulations might focus on areas such as: - Stricter licensing requirements for abortion providers - Additional reporting requirements - More stringent facility standards - Regulations on medication abortions or out-of-state abortions 6. Legal challenges: Any new regulations would likely face legal challenges, which might delay implementation. However, the conservative-leaning federal courts in the region might be more likely to uphold such laws. 7. Political motivation: With 2024 being an election year, there might be additional motivation for conservative lawmakers to pass stricter abortion regulations to appeal to their base. Given these factors, I believe there is a high probability that Oklahoma will enact new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers by July 2024. The state's history, political climate, and recent trends all point towards continued efforts to restrict abortion access.

Current political climate: Illinois is generally considered a Democratic-leaning state, with a history of supporting abortion rights. The state has already taken steps to protect abortion access, including passing the Reproductive Health Act in 2019. 2. Existing legal protections: Illinois already has strong abortion protections in place. The state's Reproductive Health Act enshrines the right to abortion as a fundamental right. This reduces the immediate need for a referendum to further protect these rights. 3. Timeframe: The question asks about a referendum by August 2024, which is a relatively short timeframe. Organizing a statewide referendum requires significant planning, resources, and political will. 4. Lack of current momentum: As of now, there doesn't appear to be any significant public push or political movement in Illinois for holding such a referendum. Usually, these initiatives are preceded by public discussions, legislative proposals, or grassroots campaigns. 5. National context: While some states have been moving to restrict abortion rights following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Illinois has been moving in the opposite direction, further solidifying abortion protections. This reduces the urgency for a referendum. 6. Legislative process: In Illinois, to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot (which would be the most likely form for enshrining abortion rights), it needs to be approved by a three-fifths majority in both houses of the state legislature. There's no indication that such a process is currently underway. 7. Election cycle: 2024 is a presidential election year, which might make it less likely for state officials to push for a separate referendum on a contentious issue like abortion rights. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Illinois will hold a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024.

Brown University is a prestigious institution with significant resources, which makes this more plausible. However, there's no current public information suggesting Brown is planning such a move.

However, there's no current indication of a planned referendum specifically on labor union laws. Referendums are typically planned well in advance, and with the resolution date being August 2024, there's limited time for such a significant event to be organized. The requirement for a statewide vote specifically on labor union laws makes this scenario less likely. Given these factors, the probability of this part occurring seems quite low, perhaps around 10-15%. Part B: Virginia's Medicaid plan with work requirements enrolling 25,000 beneficiaries by July 2024 - Virginia has been attempting to implement Medicaid work requirements for several years. However, work requirements in Medicaid have faced legal challenges in multiple states, and the Biden administration has been generally opposed to such requirements. As of 2023, Virginia's work requirement plan has not been implemented due to federal resistance and legal issues. Even if implemented, reaching 25,000 enrollees by July 2024 could be challenging given potential implementation delays and the time needed for enrollment processes. The ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency has also complicated Medicaid policies and enrollment procedures. Considering these factors, the probability of this part occurring also seems low, perhaps around 20-25%. Combined Probability: To resolve YES, only one of these events needs to occur. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), and assuming independence: P(YES) = 0.15 + 0.25 - (0.15 * 0.25) = 0.3625.

Recent policy stance: The BOJ has been one of the last major central banks to maintain an extremely accommodative monetary policy.

If global economic conditions deteriorate, there might be a shift towards easing policies again. Given these factors, I believe the probability of a rate cut announcement is low but not negligible. The BOJ has been reluctant to cut rates further into negative territory, and their focus has been on other policy tools. However, if economic conditions worsen significantly or if deflation pressures intensify, they might consider a rate cut. The relatively long time frame until August 2024 increases the uncertainty and leaves room for unexpected economic developments that could necessitate a rate cut.

Recent legislative history: In 2022, North Carolina enacted a law banning most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. This indicates a willingness to restrict abortion rights, but falls short of a total ban. 3. Time frame: The question asks about passage by July 2024, which is about a year away. This provides ample time for the legislature to draft and vote on such a bill. 4. National context: Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many Republican-led states have moved to enact stricter abortion laws. This national trend could influence North Carolina lawmakers. 5. Public opinion: North Carolina is a swing state, and public opinion on abortion is divided. Lawmakers may be cautious about passing extremely restrictive laws that could face significant public backlash. 6. Upcoming elections: The 2024 elections could influence legislative priorities. Lawmakers might push for such a bill to energize their base, or they might avoid it to appeal to moderate voters. 7. Legal challenges: Even if passed, a total abortion ban would likely face immediate legal challenges, which might make some lawmakers hesitant. 8. Definition of 'total ban': The question allows for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life. This makes passage somewhat more likely than an absolute ban with no exceptions. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that the North Carolina Senate could pass such a bill, but it's far from certain. The Republican majority and national trends favor passage, but potential public backlash, election considerations, and the governor's opposition create substantial uncertainty."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "c0def93e-9ee2-4162-bc08-709ff65c2e14", "title": "Will both of the following occur by July 2024: (a) An enforceable ethics code for U.S. administrative law judges is established, and (b) The North Carolina Senate passes a total abortion ban?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following events occur by July 31, 2024: (a) An enforceable ethics code specifically for U.S. administrative law judges is officially adopted by the United States government.

(b) North Carolina Senate passing a total abortion ban: North Carolina currently has a 12-week abortion ban, which was passed in May 2023. This law already includes exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. Given that a significant restriction has already been implemented, there might be less immediate pressure to pass a total ban. However, the political climate around abortion rights remains volatile, and some states have moved towards more restrictive laws. North Carolina has a Republican-controlled legislature, which could potentially push for stricter measures.

They have been operating their Waymo One service in Phoenix, Arizona, since 2018, and have expanded to other cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. 2. Existing partnership: Waymo and Lyft have had a partnership since 2019, which suggests an established relationship and potential for collaboration. 3. Regulatory environment: The regulatory landscape for autonomous vehicles is evolving, with some cities and states being more welcoming than others. This could affect the speed of deployment in different areas. 4.

Political climate: Oregon is a predominantly Democratic state with a history of supporting reproductive rights. There might not be a pressing need for additional protections via referendum. 3. Recent legislative actions: In 2022, Oregon passed a law to protect abortion providers and patients from out-of-state legal action. This suggests that the state government is proactive in protecting abortion rights through legislative means rather than referendums. 4.

If inflation starts to cool down, there might be room for an interest rate cut. The central bank typically adjusts rates gradually, so a cut by August 2024 is possible but not certain. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%. (b) Mexico's Senate passing a major economic reform bill opposed by President L\u00f3pez Obrador: This is a more complex political situation. President L\u00f3pez Obrador, known for his populist policies, has significant influence over his party, which holds a majority in the Senate. However, his term ends in September 2024, just after the resolution date of this question. As his presidency nears its end, there might be more willingness among senators to pass reforms that he opposes, especially if public opinion shifts. Additionally, opposition parties might gain more influence as the next election approaches. Still, passing a 'major' economic reform bill that the President explicitly opposes is a significant challenge. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18 or 18%.

However, Hillary Clinton is not currently running for president in 2024, and there's no indication she plans to do so.

Condition (b): Indiana's near-total abortion ban being declared constitutional by August 2024.

The legal landscape around abortion rights is complex and evolving, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade. However, given that the Indiana Supreme Court has already ruled against the ban based on the state constitution, it would be challenging for a lower court to overturn this decision. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for such a significant legal reversal to occur, considering potential appeals and the usual pace of the legal system. While it's not impossible for the ban to be declared constitutional, it seems unlikely given the recent state Supreme Court decision and the limited timeframe.

Wade has led to increased scrutiny of state-level abortion laws. - However, many conservative states have been successful in implementing strict abortion laws. - The composition of the Indiana Supreme Court or lower courts could change by August 2024, potentially affecting future rulings. - There's a possibility that the law could be modified to address constitutional concerns and then be upheld. Considering both scenarios, it seems more likely that the Indiana abortion ban could be declared constitutional than the UAW endorsing a former secretary of state. However, both events are still relatively unlikely. The abortion ban being declared constitutional is perhaps a 30% chance, while the UAW endorsement of a former secretary of state is extremely low, perhaps 1% or less.

The current policy rate is at a record high of 11.25%. Inflation trajectory: The central bank's primary mandate is to control inflation. If inflation shows a consistent downward trend towards the target rate of 3%, it could pave the way for rate cuts. Global economic environment: The actions of major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, influence Mexico's monetary policy. If global economic conditions improve and other central banks begin to ease their policies, it could create room for Mexico to follow suit. Economic growth: If Mexico's economic growth slows significantly, it might prompt the central bank to consider rate cuts to stimulate the economy. Time frame: The question allows for over a year (from June 2023 to August 2024) for this announcement to occur, which is a considerable amount of time for economic conditions to change. Historical context: Central banks typically move cautiously, especially after a period of tightening. They often wait to ensure inflation is firmly under control before cutting rates. Forward guidance: The central bank's communications and forward guidance will be crucial indicators of their intentions. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of a rate cut announcement by August 2024.

While it's possible that economic conditions could change significantly by 2024, allowing for rate cuts, it's important to note that central banks typically move cautiously. The bank would likely need to see sustained evidence of cooling inflation and stable economic growth before considering rate cuts. However, given the extended timeframe (over a year), there is a reasonable chance that economic conditions could improve enough to warrant a rate cut by August 2024.

WHO criteria for declaring an outbreak over: Typically, the WHO considers an outbreak over after two incubation periods have passed without new cases. For mpox, the incubation period is usually 6-13 days, so this would mean about 26 days without new cases. 4.

Considering the definition of recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth) and the timeframe (until July 2024), there is a good chance that Spain will avoid this scenario.

The current government is unlikely to feel pressure to hold a referendum to enshrine these rights further. 3. Recent legislative actions: In 2023, Washington passed laws to protect abortion providers and patients from out-of-state prosecution.

Timeline: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which gives the program about a month to reach the target enrollment after the question's creation date. 2. Work requirements: Medicaid work requirements have been controversial and faced legal challenges in other states. They can potentially reduce enrollment by creating additional barriers for eligible individuals. 3. Historical context: Other states that have implemented work requirements for Medicaid have seen significant drops in enrollment. For example, Arkansas saw thousands lose coverage when it implemented similar requirements. 4. Legal challenges: The question mentions potential legal challenges or federal interventions. Given the Biden administration's opposition to Medicaid work requirements, there's a possibility of federal intervention. 5. Tennessee's specific plan: Without more details about Tennessee's implementation strategy or current enrollment numbers, it's difficult to gauge how successful they might be in reaching 25,000 beneficiaries. 6. Short timeframe: With only a month between the question's creation and resolution, it seems unlikely that Tennessee could implement the program and enroll 25,000 people so quickly, especially with work requirements in place. 7. Political climate: The current federal administration is generally not supportive of Medicaid work requirements, which could impact the program's implementation or continuation. Given these factors, especially the short timeframe, the historical difficulties with work requirements in Medicaid programs, and the potential for legal or federal intervention, it seems unlikely that Tennessee's program will reach 25,000 enrollees by July 2024. The work requirement is likely to slow down enrollment rather than encourage it. However, there is still some uncertainty. If Tennessee has already been implementing this program for some time before the question was created, or if they have a particularly effective outreach and enrollment strategy, they might be closer to the goal than we can determine from the given information.

In 2019, the state passed a 'trigger law' that went into effect after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, banning nearly all abortions except to save the mother's life. Given this existing strict stance, it's less likely that Arkansas would pass an even more restrictive total ban. However, political climates can change, and there's always a possibility of further restrictions. The probability of this occurring is relatively low, perhaps around 15-20%. (b) Virginia holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 31, 2024: Virginia's political landscape regarding abortion rights has been contentious. In 2023, there were discussions about potentially holding a referendum on abortion rights, but no concrete plans were made. The state currently allows abortions up to the third trimester, but there have been efforts from both sides to either restrict or protect these rights. Given the ongoing debate and the fact that referendums on contentious issues are not uncommon in the US, there's a moderate chance this could occur. However, organizing a referendum takes time and political will. The probability of this happening is perhaps around 30-35%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the probability rule for independent events (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), and assuming these events are independent: P(YES) = P(Arkansas ban) + P(Virginia referendum) - P(Both occur) \u2248 0.20 + 0.35 - (0.20 * 0.35) \u2248 0.55 - 0.07 \u2248 0.48.

Historical precedent: Barclays has previously engaged in similar transactions. In 2023, Barclays Bank issued pass-through certificates worth \u20b97,016 crore (approximately $850 million) in India. This demonstrates that the bank has experience with this type of financial instrument and is willing to use it as a strategy. 2. Market conditions: The global financial market has been experiencing volatility due to various factors, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions. In such conditions, banks often look for alternative funding sources or ways to manage their loan portfolios, which could increase the likelihood of issuing pass-through certificates. 3. Regulatory environment: Banks are under constant pressure to maintain healthy balance sheets and meet regulatory requirements. Pass-through certificates can be an effective tool for managing risk and improving liquidity, which aligns with regulatory expectations. 4. Time frame: The question allows for a period of about 14 months from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a reasonable timeframe for a large bank like Barclays to plan and execute such a financial transaction. 5. Amount threshold: The $1 billion threshold is significant but not unreasonable for a bank of Barclays' size. Given that they issued certificates worth about $850 million in 2023, reaching $1 billion is plausible. 6. Global presence: Barclays operates in multiple countries, which provides various opportunities for such transactions across different markets. 7. Economic uncertainties: The ongoing economic challenges globally might push banks to explore various financial instruments to manage their portfolios effectively. However, we must also consider potential counterarguments: 1. Alternative strategies: Barclays might choose other financial instruments or strategies to manage its loan portfolio or address funding gaps. 2. Market saturation: If Barclays has recently issued a large amount of pass-through certificates, they might not need to do so again in the near future. 3. Regulatory changes: Any significant changes in banking regulations could affect the likelihood of such issuances. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high probability that Barclays will issue pass-through certificates worth at least $1 billion by August 2024. The bank has demonstrated willingness and ability to use this instrument, and the economic conditions suggest it could be a useful tool.

Many institutions have already removed the Sackler name from their buildings. 2. Harvard's stance: Harvard has been more resistant to removing the Sackler name compared to other institutions. In 2019, Harvard President Lawrence Bacow stated that the university would not remove Arthur Sackler's name from the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, citing that Arthur Sackler died before OxyContin was developed and marketed. 3. Pressure on Harvard: There has been ongoing pressure from students, alumni, and the public to remove the Sackler name from Harvard's buildings. This pressure may continue to grow. 4. Precedent: Other prestigious institutions like the Louvre, Tate Modern, and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art have already removed the Sackler name from their buildings. 5. Time frame: The question asks about a relatively short time frame (by August 2024), which gives Harvard limited time to change its stance and implement such a decision. 6. Specific focus on Arthur Sackler: The question specifically asks about Arthur Sackler's name, not other Sacklers. This is important because Arthur died before OxyContin was introduced, which has been Harvard's main argument for keeping his name. 7. Harvard's decision-making process: Such a decision would likely require approval from various university bodies and could take considerable time to implement. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that Harvard will remove Arthur Sackler's name by August 2024. Harvard has maintained its position for years despite growing pressure, and they have a specific argument for keeping Arthur Sackler's name as opposed to other Sacklers. The short timeframe also works against a change happening. However, public opinion and pressure can shift rapidly, and if new information comes to light or if other major institutions make similar moves, Harvard might reconsider its stance. There's also always a possibility of a change in university leadership that could lead to a different approach.

(b) University of Sydney removing a name due to historical controversies: Australian universities, like many around the world, have been grappling with their colonial past and the legacies of historical figures. The University of Sydney, as one of Australia's oldest institutions, likely has buildings or spaces named after controversial historical figures. There's been a global trend of universities reassessing such names. However, these processes often take time and can be contentious. The specific timeframe (by August 2024) gives some time for such a decision to be made, but it's not guaranteed.

The University of Sydney, as a prominent institution, may face pressure to address any controversial names on its campus. 4. However, there's less specific information about ongoing controversies or campaigns at the University of Sydney compared to the Harvard situation. Considering these factors: - The Harvard situation seems more likely to result in a name removal, given the ongoing controversy and precedent of removing other Sackler names. - The University of Sydney situation is less clear, but the global trend and Australia's ongoing discussions about historical issues make it a possibility. - The timeframe of over a year provides enough time for either institution to make and implement such a decision.

Time frame: The question asks about enactment by July 2024, which is about a year away. This provides ample time for legislation to be proposed, debated, and passed if there is political will. 5. Public opinion: Minnesota tends to be more liberal on social issues, which could support legislation protecting transgender youth rights. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Minnesota would enact a law restricting medical care for transgender youth. However, the question asks about modifying restrictions, which could also mean strengthening protections or codifying the executive order into law. Considering the state's political leanings, the existing executive order, and the trend of some states moving to protect rather than restrict transgender rights, there is a moderate to high probability that Minnesota might enact a law that further protects or clarifies rights to medical care for transgender youth. However, we must also consider that the current executive order might be seen as sufficient, potentially reducing the urgency for new legislation.

Given the timeframe (by August 2024), which includes the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, there might be increased scrutiny on political statements.

Historical precedent: The FDA has issued recalls for spices due to lead contamination in the past. For example, in 2019, there was a recall of turmeric powder due to elevated lead levels. 2. Lead contamination in spices: Lead contamination in spices, including paprika, is a known issue. Spices can become contaminated through various means, including soil contamination, processing equipment, or storage containers. 3. Increased awareness and testing: There has been growing awareness about heavy metal contamination in foods, which may lead to increased testing and scrutiny of spice products. 4. Short timeframe: The question specifies a relatively short timeframe (about a month) for the FDA to issue a recall, which reduces the likelihood of occurrence. 5. Specificity to ground paprika: The question is specific to ground paprika, not all spices, which narrows the scope and reduces the probability. 6. FDA's recall process: The FDA typically issues recalls after receiving reports of contamination or conducting its own tests. This process can take time, especially if initial reports are just emerging. 7. Regulatory focus: While food safety is a priority, the FDA deals with numerous issues across various food products. Ground paprika may not be a top priority unless a significant contamination issue is discovered. 8. Industry self-regulation: Many spice companies conduct their own quality control tests, which might prevent severely contaminated products from reaching the market in the first place. Given these factors, while it's possible for the FDA to issue a recall for ground paprika due to lead contamination, the probability seems relatively low within the specified timeframe. The short time frame and specificity to ground paprika are particularly limiting factors.

Historical context: Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) has been endemic in parts of Africa for decades. The recent global outbreak brought more attention to the disease, but it's important to note that Africa has been dealing with this issue for a long time. 3. WHO's approach: The WHO is generally cautious about declaring global emergencies and equally cautious about ending them. They typically wait for clear evidence of sustained control before making such declarations. 4. Time frame: The question asks about August 2024, which is more than a year away.

Global health priorities: With the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be more resources and attention available for addressing other health issues, including mpox in Africa. 6.

Considering these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that the WHO will declare the mpox outbreak in Africa no longer a global emergency by August 2024. The main reasons for this are: - The extended time frame allows for significant progress in controlling the outbreak. - Increased global attention and resources post-COVID could be directed towards this issue. - Ongoing vaccine and treatment developments may prove effective. - The WHO has already ended the global emergency status for mpox, indicating a positive trend.

(b) WHO declaring mpox outbreak in Africa no longer a global emergency by August 2024: The mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) outbreak was declared a global health emergency by the WHO in July 2022. As of June 2023, the WHO has not yet declared the emergency over. However, there are several factors to consider: 1. The global response to mpox has been relatively swift and effective, with vaccination campaigns and increased awareness helping to control the spread. 2. The WHO typically maintains emergency status for some time after the peak of an outbreak to ensure it's truly under control. 3. By August 2024, over two years will have passed since the initial declaration, which is a significant amount of time for managing and potentially resolving such an outbreak. 4.

The state currently has a Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, who is pro-choice. This could influence the legal and political landscape surrounding abortion rights. 3.

Resistance: Some justices and conservative groups argue that an externally imposed code could threaten judicial independence. 6.

The requirement for the code to be legally binding and enforceable adds another layer of complexity that makes it less likely to be achieved by July 2024. The recent announcement by Chief Justice Roberts shows that the Court is aware of the issue and taking steps, which is a positive sign.

(a) Pennsylvania's near-total abortion ban being declared constitutional by August 2024: The current political climate in the US is highly divided on abortion rights, especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor and a divided legislature, which makes it less likely for a near-total abortion ban to be upheld. Courts have been generally skeptical of near-total abortion bans in other states. The timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively short for such a significant legal decision to be made and upheld through potential appeals. Given these factors, the probability of this condition being met seems low, perhaps around 20%. (b) An enforceable ethics code for U.S. Supreme Court justices being established by July 2024: There has been increasing public pressure for Supreme Court ethics reform. However, the Supreme Court has historically been resistant to external regulation. The timeframe (by July 2024) is quite short for such a significant change to be implemented. There are constitutional questions about Congress's authority to impose ethics rules on the Supreme Court. The current political division in Congress makes passing such legislation challenging. Considering these factors, the probability of this condition being met also seems low, perhaps around 15%.

There has been increasing pressure for the Supreme Court to adopt a formal ethics code, especially in light of recent controversies involving some justices. However, the Supreme Court has historically resisted external regulation, and the justices themselves would likely need to agree to such a code. The requirement for the code to be 'legally binding' and have 'clear mechanisms for enforcement' makes this even less likely within the given timeframe.

Some states have enacted restrictive laws, while others have moved to protect access to care. 5. Potential opposition: Even in progressive states, there can be opposition to expanding rights or access to care for transgender youth. This could potentially slow down or block legislation. 6.

This suggests that we're considering the possibility of a second bankruptcy filing and emergence within this timeframe. 3. Financial performance: Since emerging from bankruptcy in 2021, Frontier has been focusing on expanding its fiber network and improving its financial position. However, the telecom industry is highly competitive and capital-intensive, which could put pressure on the company's finances. 4. Industry trends: The telecommunications industry is experiencing rapid technological changes, with a focus on 5G and fiber networks.

The company has already gone through a bankruptcy process recently, and while challenges may persist in the telecom industry, there are no immediate indications of another bankruptcy filing.

The brand continues to exist as an online retailer under Overstock's ownership. Given that the company's assets have been largely liquidated and its operations have been fundamentally altered, it's unlikely that Bed Bath & Beyond, as it existed before bankruptcy, will 'emerge' from bankruptcy in the traditional sense. The bankruptcy process for this company is more likely to result in a complete dissolution rather than a reorganization. 2.

Let's analyze each part: 1. Utah's abortion law remaining unchanged by August 2024: Utah's current abortion law allows procedures up to 18 weeks. This law has been in place since 2019, surviving legal challenges. Given that it has already withstood scrutiny and aligns with the more moderate stance on abortion restrictions, there's a good chance it will remain unchanged. However, the political climate around abortion is volatile, and changes could occur, especially if there are shifts in state leadership or public opinion. 2. Kentucky enacting stricter abortion regulations by July 2024: Kentucky has historically been a conservative state with a tendency to impose restrictions on abortion. In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have denied any right to abortion in the state constitution. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the state won't try to enact new regulations. Given the ongoing national debate on abortion rights and the tendency of conservative states to push for more restrictions, there's a significant possibility that Kentucky might attempt to pass new, stricter regulations on abortion providers. Considering both scenarios, there's a reasonably high chance that at least one of these conditions will be met. Utah's law has a good chance of remaining unchanged, while Kentucky has a history of attempting to restrict abortion access. The timeframe (until August 2024) also provides ample opportunity for political action in either state. However, we must also consider potential obstacles: - Legal challenges could prevent new restrictions in Kentucky or alter Utah's existing law. - Changes in political leadership or public opinion could influence legislative actions. - The upcoming 2024 elections could impact state-level politics and abortion legislation. Given these factors, I believe there's a higher than average chance of this question resolving as YES, but it's far from certain."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.015794462652826968, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.003948615663206742, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17790565376222625, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, these are not considered exceptionally strict compared to other states. 5. National trends: While some states have enacted stricter abortion laws following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many others have moved to protect abortion rights. Pennsylvania's mixed political landscape makes it less likely to follow the trend of more conservative states. 6. Public opinion: Polls have shown that a majority of Pennsylvanians support keeping abortion legal in most or all cases, which could influence lawmakers' decisions. 7. Legislative process: Enacting new regulations would require agreement between the divided legislature and the governor's signature, which is unlikely given the current political makeup. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Pennsylvania will enact new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers by July 2024.

California enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024: California is known for its progressive stance on LGBTQ+ rights. However, the prompt suggests that there are current restrictions on medical care for transgender youth, which is somewhat surprising for California. The state has generally been supportive of transgender rights. Given California's political leanings and the ongoing national conversation about transgender healthcare, it's more likely that California would move to ease any existing restrictions rather than impose new ones. Considering these factors, the second scenario (California modifying laws related to transgender youth healthcare) seems more probable. California's legislative process can move relatively quickly when there's political will, and given the state's history of progressive policies, it's plausible that they might adjust or clarify their stance on this issue within the given timeframe. While either event occurring would result in a YES, the California scenario appears more likely to happen within the specified timeframe.

I would estimate the probability of Italy avoiding a recession by July 2024 at around 0.7. 2. Norwegian oil workers remaining on strike through August 2024: This is a more challenging prediction as labor disputes can be unpredictable and depend on many factors. Currently, there is no major ongoing strike among Norwegian oil workers, and predicting a strike that would last until August 2024 is highly speculative. Labor relations in Norway are generally good, with most disputes resolved through negotiation. Long-lasting strikes in the oil sector are rare due to their economic impact. The probability of a strike lasting through August 2024 is quite low, perhaps around 0.1. For the question to resolve as YES, both events must occur. We multiply the probabilities: 0.7 (avoiding recession) * 0.1 (ongoing strike) = 0.07.

Current economic conditions: As of June 2023, Canada is facing high inflation, which typically calls for higher interest rates to cool down the economy. The BoC has been raising rates to combat inflation. 2. Inflation targets: The BoC aims to keep inflation at 2%. If inflation shows signs of consistently moving towards this target, it might consider rate cuts. 3. Economic projections: The BoC and other economic institutions' projections for the Canadian economy in 2024 will play a crucial role in determining interest rate decisions. 4. Global economic conditions: International economic trends, particularly in the US (Canada's largest trading partner), influence BoC's decisions. 5. Time frame: The question allows for over a year (from June 2023 to August 2024) for economic conditions to change significantly. 6. Historical patterns: Central banks typically don't rush to cut rates after a tightening cycle without clear evidence of economic slowdown or achievement of inflation targets. 7. Forward guidance: Any hints or statements from BoC officials about future rate directions will be important indicators. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a rate cut by August 2024. The extended timeframe allows for potential economic shifts, including a possible recession or significant progress in taming inflation, which could prompt a rate cut. However, the BoC will likely be cautious about cutting rates too soon after a period of tightening, especially if inflation remains above target."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "a977edaf-2812-436b-a07d-360c18602c2e", "title": "Will both of the following occur by August 2024: (a) the average rate on a 15-year mortgage exceeds 5.5% and (b) the Bank of Canada announces a reduction in its key interest rate?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if both of the following conditions are met: (1) At any point during August 2024, the average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, as reported by Freddie Mac in its Primary Mortgage Market Survey, exceeds 5.5%.

Let's analyze each condition separately and then combine our assessments. 1. 15-year mortgage rate exceeding 5.5%: As of June 2023, the average 15-year fixed mortgage rate in the US is around 5.75-6%. While rates have been volatile, they have generally been on an upward trend due to the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation. However, predicting rates more than a year into the future is challenging. The Fed has indicated it may slow or pause rate hikes, which could lead to a stabilization or even a slight decrease in mortgage rates. Still, given the current level and the historical tendency for rates to remain elevated for extended periods, it's quite possible that rates will remain above 5.5% by August 2024. 2. Bank of Canada announcing a reduction in its key interest rate: As of June 2023, the Bank of Canada's key interest rate is at 4.75%, the highest level in 22 years. The BoC has been aggressively raising rates to combat inflation. For the BoC to announce a rate cut by August 2024, we would need to see a significant improvement in inflation and potentially some economic slowdown. While it's possible that inflation could come under control by then, central banks are typically cautious about cutting rates too quickly after a tightening cycle. They often prefer to hold rates steady for an extended period to ensure inflation is truly under control. Combining these factors: The first condition seems more likely than not, given current rate levels and historical patterns. However, the second condition is less certain. For both to occur, we would need to see a divergence in monetary policy between the US and Canada, with US rates remaining high while Canadian rates start to decrease. While not impossible, this scenario is less common. Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of both conditions being met as relatively low, but not negligible."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "b67c9f85-3a5b-410e-9bae-8e87bccbdbd6", "title": "Will either the average rate on a 15-year mortgage exceed 5.5% or the Bank of Canada announce a reduction in its key interest rate by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) At any point during August 2024, the average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, as reported by Freddie Mac in its Primary Mortgage Market Survey, exceeds 5.5%.

While rates have been volatile, they have generally been trending upward due to the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation. However, predicting rates more than a year in advance is challenging. The Fed has signaled potential rate cuts in 2024, which could lead to lower mortgage rates. Given the current rate and potential for economic changes, there's a moderate chance rates could exceed 5.5% in August 2024. b) Bank of Canada announcing a rate reduction by August 2024: The Bank of Canada's current overnight rate is 4.75% (as of June 2023). The BoC has been in a tightening cycle to combat inflation, but there are expectations that rate hikes may pause or reverse in 2024 as inflation potentially moderates. Many economists predict that central banks, including the BoC, might start cutting rates in 2024 to support economic growth. However, this depends on how quickly inflation comes under control and the overall economic conditions. Combining these factors: - There's a moderate chance of mortgage rates exceeding 5.5% by August 2024. - There's a significant chance of the BoC announcing a rate cut by August 2024. Given that only one of these conditions needs to be met for a YES resolution, and considering the time frame allows for various economic scenarios to unfold, I believe there's a relatively high probability of this question resolving as YES."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.005090559130239702, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0012726397825599256, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.10840148207519457, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
