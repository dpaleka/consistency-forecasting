The questions revolve around whether he will not show up (P), show up (not_P), or miss the event (para_P), and whether he will make a surprise appearance at another cryptocurrency event (Q). \n\n1. **P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This event is directly tied to the actual occurrence of the event. If he is not present, the question resolves positively. I estimate a moderate probability of 0.60 based on the current public sentiment and past behavior of Musk at similar events.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This is the complementary event to P. Therefore, not_P should equal 1 - P. Given my estimate for P, not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Elon Musk missing the event)**: This is closely related to P. If he does not show up, he is technically missing the event. Thus, I would assign a probability of 0.60 to para_P as well since it aligns with the P estimate.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk making a surprise appearance at another cryptocurrency event)**: This is more uncertain. Given the number of events in 2024, I estimate a lower probability of 0.30 that he will make such an appearance, as it depends on his schedule and commitments.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q happening)**: If both events occur, it would mean he is not at the Nashville event but is at another. Given the probabilities of P and Q, I would estimate this at 0.18, which is a product of their probabilities, adjusted for any correlation.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q happening)**: This is the union of P and Q. I would estimate this at 0.72, which is a higher probability since it covers both scenarios.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q happening while not P)**: This would mean he is at another event but not at Nashville. I estimate this at 0.12, considering some overlap but also independence between these events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q happening given P)**: This conditional probability would depend on the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. I estimate this at 0.40, as there is still a chance he could attend another event even if he misses Nashville.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are complementary and conditional, as they revolve around Musk's attendance. I must ensure that the probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly the relationships between P, not_P, and the various combinations of Q.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.18,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 -

Given his prominence in the cryptocurrency space, there is a reasonable chance he might not attend, so I estimate this at 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P, and thus will be 1 - P. Therefore, not_P is 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will miss the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 event?)**: This is similar to P, so I can assign it the same probability, which is 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a surprise appearance at another cryptocurrency event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of surprise appearances, I estimate this probability at 0.50.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (2) Elon Musk makes a surprise appearance at another cryptocurrency event in 2024?)**: This is a joint probability and would be lower than either individual probability. I estimate this at 0.30.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either of the following occur: (a) Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (b) Elon Musk make a surprise appearance at another cryptocurrency event in 2024?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q, so I estimate it at 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both of the following occur: (a) Elon Musk makes a surprise appearance at another cryptocurrency event in 2024, and (b) Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is unlikely to happen as these events are contradictory, so I estimate this at 0.05.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will he make a surprise appearance at another cryptocurrency event in 2024?)**: This conditional probability is likely to be higher than Q alone, as not attending Nashville might free up his schedule for other events. I estimate this at 0.60.\n\nConsidering the relationships, P and not_P are complements. The probabilities of Q and P are independent, but Q and not_P are not mutually exclusive. Hence, the estimates should respect the consistency rules outlined. \n\nI will now calculate the probabilities based on this reasoning.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 -

The questions can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. **P and not_P**: These are direct opposites. If P (Elon Musk not showing up) is true, then not_P (Elon Musk showing up) must be false, and vice versa. Therefore, if I assign a probability to P, I can directly calculate not_P as 1 - P.\n\n2. **para_P**: This question is synonymous with P, so I would expect para_P to have the same probability as P. \n\n3. **Q**: This question is independent of P and not_P, as it pertains to Musk's attendance at another event, not the Bitcoin Nashville event. Hence, I can assign a separate probability to Q based on external factors like past behavior or scheduled events.\n\n4. **P_and_Q**: This question asks for both P and Q to be true. Since P and Q are independent, I can calculate the probability of P_and_Q as P * Q. \n\n5. **P_or_Q**: This question asks whether either P or Q occurs. Using the independence of P and Q, I can calculate this as P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\n6. **Q_and_not_P**: This question requires both Q to be true and P to be false. Since these events are independent, the probability can be calculated as Q * not_P.\n\n7. **Q_given_P**: This question asks about Q given that P is true. Since P and Q are independent, the probability remains the same as Q.\n\nBased on these relationships, I will assign probabilities to P, not_P, para_P, Q, P_and_Q, P_or_Q, Q_and_not_P, and Q_given_P in a way that respects the consistency rules outlined. This means ensuring that the calculated probabilities align with the logical relationships between the events.\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.20,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.70 + 0.20 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.40, 0.50) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.50) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.70 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.20 / 0.50 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.20,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
