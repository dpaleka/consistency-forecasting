For instance, it was damaged by Ukrainian strikes in October 2022 and July 2023.\n    - Recent reports indicate that Russia has fortified the bridge with underwater barriers and increased the number of barges to protect it from Ukrainian naval drones.\n    - Despite these fortifications, there have been ongoing attempts to attack the bridge. For example, on August 15, 2024, Russia's air defenses reportedly repelled an attack involving 12 U.S.-provided ATACMS missiles targeting the Crimean Bridge.\n\n    Given that the question's resolution date is June 30, 2024, and considering the recent and ongoing nature of these attacks, it is clear that the bridge has been subject to attacks even after the created date of May 3, 2024.\n\n    Therefore, based on the available information, the question can be resolved as **NO**, because there have been attacks on the Crimean Bridge after May 2, 2024.", "answer": false}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 5.52246141819583, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 2.761230709097915, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 18.226980419426035, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
