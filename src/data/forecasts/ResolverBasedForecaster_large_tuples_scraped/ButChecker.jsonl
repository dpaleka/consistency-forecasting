There are multiple drafts of letters circulating among House Democrats and at least one would call on Biden to end his campaign, according to five people familiar with the efforts.\n\nThis market resolves YES if a group of at least five named Democratic Party US House Members/US Senators work together to ask Joe Biden to consider ending his 2024 re-election campaign, or to urge him to do so, before Saturday July 20th (Pacific Time).\n\nThis could be by signing a letter like what is reported above, but it could also be in another form such as a group speaking with Biden in person and collectively asking him to drop out.\n\nThis market requires that all five individuals be part of the same group message. Five people separately telling reporters they think Biden should drop out is not sufficient for a YES resolution.\n\nReports of any number of unnamed democrats writing to Biden and asking him to step aside will not satisfy this market's criteria unless at least 5 qualifying names are later made public before this market's end date. In any ambiguous cases where such names are reported but not confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt, this market will err towards resolving NO. \n\nIf these criteria are not met before July 20th, this market resolves NO.\n\n(b) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nResolves the same as the original on Metaculus.\n\n(https://www.metaculus.com/questions/question_embed/25755/?theme=dark)Resolution criteria\n\nThis question will resolve as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.\n\nTo qualify for a Yes resolution, the statement must be unambiguous and conclusive: it should leave no room for the possibility that Biden would accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nIf such a definitive statement is not made prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, this question will resolve as No.\n\nFine print and additional background information can be found on Metaculus.\n\nOnce the original resolves, its resolution will be applied to this market automatically.

However, we can infer from other polls around that time: A July 2024 poll by Emerson College Polling shows Trump leading Biden by 3 percentage points (46% to 43%). A Pew Research poll from July 2024 indicates Trump leading Biden by 4 percentage points (44% to 40%). A CBS News poll from July 2024 also shows Trump with a growing lead, though the exact margin on July 15 is not specified.

There is no indication in the provided sources or general knowledge up to September 2024 that Tucker Carlson was ever selected or considered as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. It is clear that Donald Trump was the primary candidate for the Republican nomination, and there is no mention of Tucker Carlson in this context.
