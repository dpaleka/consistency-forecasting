For example, Fox News was the first to report the news at 1:50 p.m., and other networks followed shortly after.\n    - However, there is no indication that any media outlet had an unofficial confirmation and reported it at least 6 hours before the official announcement. The coverage began almost immediately after Biden's announcement at 1:46 p.m. ET.\n\n    ### Part 2: Donald Trump Jr. as the Republican Nominee\n    - The question asks whether Donald Trump Jr. will be selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.\n    - There is no information in the provided sources indicating that Donald Trump Jr. has been selected or is likely to be selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Instead, the focus has been on Donald Trump's involvement in the debates and the political landscape following Biden's withdrawal.\n\n    Given the current information, we can conclude the following:\n    - For Part 1, there is no evidence that any reliable media outlet covered Joe Biden's dropout with an unofficial confirmation at least 6 hours in advance.\n    - For Part 2, there is no indication that Donald Trump Jr. will be the Republican nominee.\n\n    Since both conditions need to be met for the question to resolve as YES, and neither condition is satisfied based on the available information, the question cannot be resolved positively.\n\n    However, the question's structure suggests it is well-formed but lacks the necessary evidence to confirm either part.

He made the announcement on Sunday, July 21, 2024, via a letter posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n    - The media coverage of his dropout was extensive and immediate.
