The focus is on security measures, terrorist threats, and logistical challenges rather than athletic achievements.\n\n    Given that:\n    - We do not have confirmation of a terrorist act meeting the criteria.\n    - There is no information about an armed forces conflict death between China and Taiwan.\n    - There is no data on the number of world records broken during the Olympics.\n\n    It is clear that the question cannot be resolved with the available information.", "second_call_metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To determine the resolution of the question, we need to evaluate two main conditions and then assess if at least 24 world records were broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Condition (a): Terrorist Act in Metropolitan France - There is evidence of malicious acts, including arson attacks, targeting France's high-speed TGV rail network on the day of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony. These acts were described as 'outrageous criminal acts' and 'sabotage' by French authorities, which aligns with the definition of a terrorist act in the context of this question. Condition (b): Armed Forces Conflict Death Between China and Taiwan - There is no provided evidence or credible reports indicating an armed forces conflict death between China and Taiwan before June 6, 2024, in the sources. Since one of the conditions (condition b) is not met based on the available information, the question's criteria are not fully satisfied. World Records Broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics - While the sources mention several notable performances and achievements during the 2024 Paris Olympics, such as L\u00e9on Marchand securing four gold medals and Armand Duplantis setting a new world record, they do not provide a comprehensive count of world records broken. However, given that at least one world record was broken (by Duplantis), it is plausible that more records could have been broken, but the exact number is not specified in the provided sources. Given the absence of explicit evidence that both conditions were met and the lack of a definitive count of world records broken, we cannot definitively resolve the question as YES or NO. Probability Assessment - Since we have no clear evidence that both conditions (a and b) were met, and we cannot verify the exact number of world records broken, the best approach is to assign a probability based on the available information. Condition (a) is met. Condition (b) is not met. There is some evidence of world records being broken but not enough to confirm at least 24. Given these points, the probability that the question resolves as YES is low due to the unmet condition (b) and the lack of detailed information on the number of world records. Final Output - Given the uncertainty and the fact that one of the critical conditions was not met, a definitive YES or NO is not possible. However, based on the information provided, the likelihood of the question resolving as YES is low. Thus, a reasonable probability assessment would be close to 0, given the critical condition (b) was not satisfied."}}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "e6f647a4-5c0c-4b28-b250-083556359979", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) A terrorist act in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics, (b) An armed forces conflict death between China and Taiwan in 2024 before June 6, 2024, and (c) At least 24 world records broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics?", "body": "(a) The question about a terrorist act in metropolitan France will resolve as Yes if a terrorist attack in [Metropolitan France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_France) injures and/or kills at least one person, other than the terrorist(s), between, and inclusive of, the day of the Opening Ceremony (26 July 2024) and the day of the Closing Ceremony (11 August 2024).

While multiple records were broken, the exact number is not provided in the sources.\n\n    ### Condition 3: The USA wins more Gold than Silver medals\n    - The sources provide details about the medal count for the USA. For instance, Simone Biles, Torri Huske, and Gabby Thomas each won three gold medals, and several other athletes contributed to the overall medal count.\n    - However, the sources do not provide a complete breakdown of the total gold versus silver medals for the USA.

BJP Forming the Government: The question assumes that the BJP forms the government after the next Indian general election in 2024. However, the provided sources do not confirm the outcome of the Indian general elections in 2024. The relevant source discusses the expectations and policies related to the BJP and the Indian government but does not provide the actual election results. 2. CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS): The question asks whether the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) will be higher on July 20, 2024, compared to July 20, 2023. The resolution depends on the actual values reported by the St. Louis Fed.
