However, this does not precisely match the date of July 15, 2024.

While the exact polling average on July 15, 2024, is not specified in the sources, the context suggests Trump was leading around that time, and it is reasonable to infer that the lead could have been within the range of greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points. However, since we do not have the exact polling data for July 15, 2024, from 538's national polling average, we cannot be certain. Therefore, the best approach is to assign a probability based on the available information.
