Donald Trump's Lead Over Joe Biden. The question specifies a condition about Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden on July 15, 2024, but this condition does not directly impact the nomination process of the Republican Party. 2. Glenn Youngkin as the Republican Nominee. We need to verify if Glenn Youngkin was selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. From the provided sources: - There is no indication that Glenn Youngkin was considered or selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election. Instead, sources suggest that Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee. - Youngkin has expressed support for the eventual Republican nominee and has specifically mentioned he would support Trump if he is the candidate.
