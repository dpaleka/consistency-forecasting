Given his active engagement with the cryptocurrency community, I would assign a relatively high probability to P (showing up) and a correspondingly lower probability to not_P. \n\nWhen considering para_P, which is essentially the same event as P, I would assign it the same probability since it is asking the same question in a different format.\n\nFor Q, which involves Musk making a public statement about Bitcoin before the conference, I would evaluate his recent social media activity and any upcoming statements he might make. If he has been vocal about Bitcoin recently, I would assign a moderate probability to Q.\n\nIn terms of the relationships between these events, P and Q are somewhat independent but can influence each other; if Musk shows up at the conference, it may increase the likelihood of him making a statement about Bitcoin. Therefore, I would expect P_and_Q (both events happening) to be less than the individual probabilities of P and Q, since both events happening together is a more specific scenario.\n\nP_or_Q would be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses the possibility of either event occurring. \n\nQ_and_not_P would be a unique scenario where Musk makes a statement but does not show up, which I would assign a lower probability to, as his attendance may correlate with making a statement. \n\nLastly, Q_given_P would be expected to be higher than Q alone, as the premise of him showing up could increase the likelihood of him making a statement. \n\nOverall, I would ensure that the probabilities assigned to each event adhere to the consistency rules provided, adjusting them as necessary to ensure that all relationships hold true mathematically.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.50 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-27T01:39:33.446931", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('bb92f6d7-86d2-45b6-b4ed-0291f567eb4d'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('e8e5e2ca-865d-4102-9b07-17caf1298bf1'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('b1097a25-c035-4c39-841f-d56c61f0b10d'), title='Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('8a114ece-fc1e-46e0-a4e3-bde4cbaf46af'), title='Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin before the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 conference?', body='This question will resolve YES if Elon Musk makes a public statement regarding Bitcoin that is widely reported in the media before July 25, 2024.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 25, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_and_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('6e581cbe-f495-45aa-b4ce-ed38ed2a3af1'), title='Will both of the following occur: (1) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?

Given his history with cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, let's say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question essentially mirrors P, so I would assign it the same probability as P, 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin before the conference?)**: Given the timing and the media attention surrounding the conference, I estimate a slightly lower probability for this event, perhaps around 0.55.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The occurrence of both events is dependent, but not perfectly correlated. I estimate this probability to be around 0.40, as both events are likely but not guaranteed to happen together.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is where I need to apply the formula for the union of two events. The probability should be higher than either individual event but less than 1. I would estimate this to be around 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?)**: This scenario is less likely as it requires Musk to make a statement without attending the event. I estimate this to be around 0.15.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: If Musk shows up, the likelihood of him making a statement increases. I would estimate this probability to be around 0.75.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that the probabilities I assign adhere to the consistency rules outlined, particularly ensuring that the relationships between P and not_P, P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and other combinations align mathematically. The independence of events will also be a consideration, especially in how P and Q relate to each other.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.40 - 0.55 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and:  andor, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.38,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09431067947124139, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047155339735620694, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44426165831931935, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
