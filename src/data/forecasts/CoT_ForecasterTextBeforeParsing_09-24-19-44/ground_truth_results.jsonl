The situation is often volatile, with military operations and retaliatory strikes being common.\n\n3. **Intelligence and Prevention**: Israel has a robust intelligence and military infrastructure that works to prevent attacks. However, the effectiveness of these measures is not absolute, especially if Iran or its proxies manage to coordinate an attack successfully.\n\n4. **Geopolitical Considerations**: Various geopolitical factors, including the involvement of other nations and changes in international relations, could influence Iran's decision-making. For example, if Iran perceives a window of opportunity or faces internal pressures, it might resort to more aggressive actions.\n\n5. **Time Frame**: The timeframe until May 1, 2024, is relatively short, but given the historical context and ongoing tensions, the risk of a significant attack cannot be dismissed entirely.\n\nTaking into account these factors, while there is a considerable risk of violence, the specific requirement of an attack leading to the death of at least five individuals adds a layer of uncertainty.

However, as noted in the above article, Lodge has found support of island nations - such as Kiribati - who stand to benefit immensely from DSM.\n\nOne DSM company - [The Metals Company (TMC)](https://metals.co) - has been a major supporter of DSM and has carried out extensive environmental studies supporting its position of allowing the practice.

However, the outcome can be influenced by emerging candidates and shifts in member state support.

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\n\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\n\n>Tesla\u2019s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\n\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\n\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\n\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\n\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\n\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\n\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis.

The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\n\n---------------------\n\nSee related question:\n\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)"}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the likelihood of ISS advising against Elon Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election, we need to consider a few factors.

Additionally, Kimbal Musk's re-election could be scrutinized if there are concerns about board independence or conflicts of interest. However, Tesla has a strong market position and a dedicated shareholder base, which might influence ISS to support management decisions unless there are significant governance issues. Given Musk's prominence and the overall positive sentiment around Tesla, it's possible that ISS may not find sufficient grounds to advise against either the pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election.

However, AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.\n\n> AI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm. However, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\n\n> So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues. Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated.

Therefore, once an adequate process for anonymously raising concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise exists, we accept that concerns should be raised through such a process initially.

The \"Deadpool\" character, in particular, has gained immense popularity since the first film's release, and the inclusion of Wolverine, a fan-favorite character from the X-Men series, could attract even more viewers. 2. **Cultural Context**: The superhero film genre has been incredibly lucrative in recent years, with many films breaking box office records. The combination of two popular characters in one film is likely to generate significant interest and hype, potentially leading to a higher opening weekend. 3. **Marketing and Promotion**: The marketing strategy for \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" will play a critical role. If the marketing campaign is robust and effectively targets both existing fans and new audiences, it could drive higher ticket sales. 4. **Release Timing**: The timing of the release can also impact box office performance. If the film is released during a favorable window (e.g., summer or holiday season) when audiences are more likely to attend theaters, this could further increase the chances of a strong opening. 5. **Comparative Analysis**: The combined opening of \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine\" is $185,548,391. Given the trajectory of superhero films and the heightened interest in crossover events, it is reasonable to predict that \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" could surpass this figure, especially if it manages to attract both returning fans and new viewers.

Additionally, the increasing global participation in sports and the development of athletic programs in various countries suggest that more nations are becoming competitive.\n\nHowever, the exact number of countries that will win their first medal can be difficult to predict, as it heavily depends on the performance of athletes and the competitiveness of the events.

As of my last training data in October 2023, the inflationary pressures and economic indicators leading up to July 2024 are critical in making this determination. If the economy is experiencing steady growth, increased consumer spending, or if there are supply chain disruptions, these factors could contribute to a higher Core CPI. Conversely, if the Federal Reserve has been successful in controlling inflation, we might see a lower increase or even a decrease in the Core CPI. Additionally, recent trends in Core CPI data leading up to July 2024 would provide insight into whether a 0.1% increase is plausible. If the monthly increases have been consistently above this threshold in the preceding months, that would suggest a higher probability of a similar trend continuing.

The film \"Old,\" for example, grossed approximately $16.8 million during its opening weekend, which is relatively close to the $20 million mark. Considering the current cinematic landscape, which includes competition from other films, audience interest, marketing efforts, and critical reception, it is reasonable to assess the likelihood of \"Trap\" surpassing the $20 million threshold. The film's marketing strategy and audience anticipation will play critical roles in its performance.

In Season 1, the ratings varied, with several episodes scoring above 8.5, notably the finale (E10: 9.2) and E8 (9.3). However, the ratings in Season 2 have been less consistent. The first few episodes of Season 2 have ratings lower than 8.5, with E1 and E2 both at 8.4, E3 at 7.9, and E5 at 7.6. E4 was an outlier with a high rating of 9.6, which suggests that there are fluctuations in audience reception. The significant factor to consider is that the show has a dedicated fan base and a high level of anticipation for the finale, which typically tends to receive better ratings due to the culmination of story arcs and character development. Given that the previous finale (E10 of Season 1) scored highly, it is reasonable to expect that the series will aim to deliver a strong conclusion for Season 2 as well. However, the performance of the preceding episodes in Season 2 raises some concerns. The low ratings for episodes like E5 and E6 could indicate a decline in audience interest or satisfaction, which may affect the finale's score. Ultimately, while there is a historical precedent for strong finale ratings, the recent trend in Season 2 suggests a potential risk for a lower score.

The geopolitical context between these two nations is crucial in assessing the likelihood of such events. Historically, tensions in the South China Sea and other regional disputes have led to diplomatic strains between the Philippines and China. Recent events, such as military maneuvers, territorial disputes, and public statements from both governments, suggest that the relationship remains fraught.  Given the current trajectory of diplomatic relations, there is a reasonable chance that either country could take steps to expel or recall diplomats as a show of discontent or in response to specific incidents. While these actions are often seen as last resorts, they are not uncommon in diplomatic relations, especially in tense situations. Furthermore, both nations have a history of using diplomatic measures to express grievances.

Next, we should consider the publication pattern of Chainsaw Man and any announcements that have been made regarding breaks. If there have been previous instances of breaks in the series or if there is a pattern of breaks in similar series, that would increase the likelihood of a break occurring. Additionally, since the question will be resolved on the official release date, any announcements made before that time will also influence the probability. If there has been no prior indication of a break in the lead-up to chapter 173's release, this would suggest a lower probability of a break.

The character's popularity and the comedic tone have garnered a strong fanbase, which is likely to carry over to a sequel featuring Wolverine. 2. **Wolverine's Popularity**: Wolverine is one of the most iconic characters in the X-Men universe and has a strong following. His inclusion in the film is likely to attract additional viewers, especially since Hugh Jackman's portrayal has been well-received over the years. 3. **Box Office Trends**: The box office performance of superhero movies has been on an upward trend, particularly for those that feature popular characters and are part of well-established franchises. The first \"Deadpool\" film had a strong opening weekend, and even the more modestly received \"The Wolverine\" had a significant box office showing. 4. **Market Conditions**: The film industry has been recovering from the pandemic, and box office numbers have been improving. If the movie is released during a favorable time with little competition, it could perform exceptionally well. 5. **Expectations and Marketing**: The marketing strategy leading up to the release and the overall anticipation for the film will also play a crucial role.

Next, we should consider the teams they are driving for and their relative competitiveness. If Tsunoda is in a car that generally performs better than Ricciardo's, that would further enhance his chances. Additionally, factors such as the track characteristics of Spa-Francorchamps (the location of the Belgian Grand Prix) and how each driver has performed there in the past would also play a role. We would also need to consider the impact of sprint races, as points can be earned in those as well. If Tsunoda has a history of performing well in sprints, that could give him an edge.

The upward trend suggests that as time progresses and advancements in AI continue, more respondents may become convinced that weak AGI has been achieved. Furthermore, the lack of a strict definition for \"weak AGI\" allows respondents to interpret the term based on their understanding, which could lead to a broader acceptance of the idea that we are closer to achieving it. Given the steady progress in AI technologies and the increasing public and expert discourse around AGI, it is plausible that the percentage of respondents agreeing will surpass the 30% threshold.

It's also common for series to have planned breaks, which are often announced at the end of chapters. Given that the question is about a specific upcoming chapter, we should look for any recent announcements or trends regarding Kagurabachi. If there have been consistent patterns of breaks in the past, or if there has been an official announcement regarding a break after chapter 40, that would increase the probability of a YES. However, if there have been no announcements and the series has been consistent in its release schedule, then the likelihood of a break occurring may be lower. Without specific information indicating a break, one might lean towards the probability of NO being higher. Considering the timing of the question and the typical release schedule of Shonen Jump, it is reasonable to estimate that there may not be a break, especially if the series has been maintaining a regular release pattern.

If the Panama match occurred shortly before the US match, it is plausible that the coach would look to rest key players. 2. Match Importance: If the match against the US is viewed as critical for advancing in the tournament, the coach might opt to field a stronger lineup. Conversely, if the outcome of the match does not significantly impact their chances of progressing, they may choose to rotate more players. 3. Player Condition: The physical condition of the players after the Panama match will also be a factor. If several starters are showing signs of fatigue or minor injuries, it would increase the likelihood of rotation. 4. Historical Precedent: Looking at past Copa America tournaments, it is common for teams to rotate players, particularly in the group stages where managing player fitness is crucial. Taking these considerations into account, while it is certainly possible that Uruguay could rotate four or more starters, the decision will heavily depend on the context of the tournament, the coach's philosophy, and the specific circumstances surrounding the matches.
