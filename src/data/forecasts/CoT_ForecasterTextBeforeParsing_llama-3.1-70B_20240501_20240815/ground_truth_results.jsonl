While RESP-NET does not collect data on all hospitalizations caused by respiratory illnesses, it can describe hospitalizations caused by three viruses that account for a large proportion of these hospitalizations. Surveillance is conducted through a network of acute care hospitals in select counties or county equivalents in 12 states for RSV surveillance, 13 states for COVID-19 surveillance, and 14 states for influenza surveillance.

To answer this question, we need to consider the typical patterns of these respiratory viruses and how they interact with each other. Firstly, COVID, influenza, and RSV typically have distinct peaks during the winter season in the US. However, the exact timing and magnitude of these peaks can vary from year to year due to factors such as vaccination rates, population immunity, and climate conditions. Given the complexity of these factors and the potential for interactions between the viruses, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations for each virus will occur within four weeks of the combined peak. However, we can make an educated estimate based on historical data and general trends.

However, qualification is not guaranteed, and the competition is fierce. The selection process for Eurovision involves two semi-finals, where countries compete to secure a spot in the Grand Final. The top 10 countries from each semi-final, as determined by a combination of jury and public voting, qualify for the Grand Final. Albania's qualification will depend on the performance of its selected artist and song, as well as the voting patterns of the other participating countries. Historically, Albania has had mixed results in the contest, with some years seeing them qualify comfortably and others narrowly missing out. Without information on the specific artist, song, or voting trends for Eurovision 2024, it's challenging to make a precise prediction.

Given its strategic importance and the ongoing conflict in the region, there is a possibility of an attack on the bridge. However, predicting the likelihood of such an event is challenging due to the complexity of geopolitical factors and the unpredictability of military actions. That being said, there are a few factors to consider: 1. Ongoing conflict: The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been ongoing since 2014, and there have been instances of attacks on critical infrastructure in the region. This increases the likelihood of an attack on the Crimean Bridge. 2. Strategic importance: The Crimean Bridge is a critical transportation artery, providing a direct link between Crimea and mainland Russia. Its destruction or damage could have significant economic and military implications, making it a potential target for Ukrainian or other opposing forces. 3. Security measures: Russia has likely taken extensive security measures to protect the bridge, including military patrols, surveillance, and potential defensive systems. These measures could reduce the likelihood of a successful attack. 4. International tensions: The current geopolitical climate is tense, with increased military presence and rhetoric from both Russia and NATO. This could lead to an increased risk of miscalculation or escalation, potentially resulting in an attack on the bridge.

Without knowledge of the investigation's progress or any leads, it's challenging to predict the likelihood of charges being filed. 2. Political Climate: The political climate in Slovakia and the relationship between the government and opposition parties could influence the likelihood of charges being filed. However, without specific information on the current political situation or any tensions that might lead to such charges, it's difficult to factor this into the prediction. 3. Legal Process: The legal process in Slovakia, including how quickly investigations are typically resolved and how charges are filed, could also impact the likelihood. However, without specific knowledge of Slovak legal procedures and their timelines, it's hard to estimate how likely it is for charges to be filed within the given timeframe. 4. Precedents: Past instances of similar situations in Slovakia or comparable countries might offer insights. However, without specific examples or knowledge of how those situations were handled, it's challenging to draw relevant conclusions. Given these considerations, the prediction is largely speculative. However, it's reasonable to assume that investigations into assassination attempts are typically thorough and can take significant time.

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\n\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\n\n>Tesla\u2019s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\n\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\n\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\n\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\n\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\n\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\n\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has [advised](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1) shareholders *not* to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\n\n---------------------\n\nSee related question:\n\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)"}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "Reasoning: The decision by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) to advise shareholders against Elon Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election will depend on various factors, including the overall sentiment towards Musk's leadership, the performance of Tesla, and the specific details of the pay package. Given the significant public scrutiny and discussions surrounding executive compensation, there is a plausible chance that ISS could recommend against the package, especially if they find it excessive or misaligned with shareholder interests. However, the historical context shows that ISS often supports management unless there are compelling reasons to oppose them.

Factors such as the number of candidates, their popularity, and the overall political landscape leading up to the convention will play a significant role.

According to the Olympic Games' history, the number of participating countries has consistently risen, with some fluctuations. This trend is likely to continue in 2024. Secondly, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been actively working to increase diversity and inclusion in the Olympics, which could lead to more countries winning their first medals. The IOC has introduced various initiatives, such as the Olympic Solidarity program, which provides financial and technical assistance to National Olympic Committees (NOCs) from developing countries. These initiatives aim to help smaller and less experienced NOCs to develop their sports programs and compete more effectively at the Olympic Games. Thirdly, the Olympics feature a wide range of sports and events, providing opportunities for countries to win medals in different disciplines. Some sports, like athletics, swimming, and gymnastics, tend to have a higher number of participating countries and medal winners, while others, like equestrian, sailing, and modern pentathlon, may have fewer participants but still offer opportunities for new countries to win medals. Lastly, it's worth noting that the Olympics often see a few countries winning their first-ever medals. For example, at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 6 countries won their first-ever Olympic medals.

As of the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), the 538 national polling average shows Trump leading Biden by 2.4 points. However, it's essential to note that polling averages can fluctuate over time due to various factors such as changes in voter sentiment, polling methodology, and sampling variability.

Geomagnetic storms are caused by changes in the Earth's magnetic field, often due to solar activity such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or high-speed solar wind streams. The Kp index is a measure of the intensity of geomagnetic storms, with higher values indicating stronger storms. Historical data from the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) shows that geomagnetic storms with Kp values greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 are relatively rare, but not uncommon. According to the GFZ's 30-day history data product, the Kp index typically ranges from 0 to 3, with occasional storms reaching Kp values of 4 or 5. However, predicting the exact intensity of geomagnetic storms is challenging, as it depends on various factors such as the strength and direction of the solar wind, the density of the solar plasma, and the Earth's magnetic field configuration. Given the uncertainty in predicting geomagnetic storm intensities, I will rely on historical probabilities to estimate the likelihood of a Kp value greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 between July 17 and July 28, 2024. According to the GFZ's data, the probability of a Kp value greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 on any given day is around 10-20%. However, since we are considering a 12-day period, the probability of at least one day with a Kp value in this range is higher. Assuming independence between days, the probability of at least one day with a Kp value greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 between July 17 and July 28, 2024, can be estimated using the binomial distribution. Let's assume a probability of 15% per day (a rough estimate based on historical data). The probability of at least one day with a Kp value greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 in 12 days is: 1 - (probability of no days with Kp > 4 and \u2264 5)^12 = 1 - (0.85)^12 \u2248 0.79.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the historical performance of video game adaptations and the factors that might influence the film's reception. Firstly, video game adaptations have had mixed success in the past, with some receiving high praise and others being panned by critics and audiences alike. However, the \"Borderlands\" franchise has a dedicated fan base and a unique blend of action, humor, and style that could translate well to the big screen. Secondly, the film's marketing and production team will play a significant role in shaping the final product. If the film is well-made, faithful to the source material, and effectively marketed, it could resonate with both fans of the game and new audiences. Lastly, CinemaScore is a measure of audience reception, not critical reception. While critical reviews can influence audience perception, a film can still receive a high CinemaScore even if it receives mixed or negative reviews from critics. Given these factors, I would estimate that the probability of \"Borderlands\" (2024) receiving a CinemaScore of B- or above is around 0.7.

To answer this question, we need to consider the current trends and fluctuations in Nate Silver's model. As of the current date (August 3rd), we do not have real-time access to Nate Silver's model or its current probabilities. However, we can make an educated guess based on general knowledge of how election models work and the typical volatility of election polls. Election models like Nate Silver's typically aggregate polling data and other factors to estimate a candidate's chances of winning. These models can fluctuate daily based on new polling data, changes in voter sentiment, and other factors. Given that the question asks about a specific probability threshold (46.6%) on a specific date (August 9th), we need to consider the likelihood of Kamala's probability increasing or remaining above this threshold. Without access to real-time data, we can't make a precise prediction. However, we can consider the following: Election models can be volatile, and probabilities can fluctuate significantly over short periods. Kamala's current probability might be close to the threshold, making it plausible that it could increase or remain above 46.6% by August 9th. The time frame of one week is relatively short, which might limit the potential for significant changes in the model.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) will gross more than $20 million during its domestic opening weekend, let's consider several factors: 1. Director's Track Record: M. Night Shyamalan has a history of creating suspenseful, often twist-ending films that attract a wide audience. Movies like 'The Sixth Sense,' 'Unbreakable,' and more recently, 'Split' and 'Glass,' have performed well at the box office. This suggests a loyal fan base and a certain level of commercial success. 2. Recent Performance of Similar Films: Looking at Shyamalan's recent films, 'Old' (2021) opened with $16,854,735, as mentioned in the prompt. While this is below the $20 million threshold, it indicates a consistent level of interest in his work. Given the right marketing and word-of-mouth, it's plausible that 'Trap' could perform similarly or slightly better, especially if it garners positive reviews. 3. Market Conditions and Competition: The success of a film's opening weekend can be heavily influenced by the competitive landscape and current market trends. Without specific information on what other films are releasing around the same time as 'Trap,' it's difficult to assess this factor accurately. However, if 'Trap' is well-marketed and receives positive early reviews, it could carve out a successful opening weekend despite competition. 4. Marketing and Anticipation: The level of anticipation and the effectiveness of the marketing campaign can significantly impact a film's opening weekend. If the trailer and promotional materials for 'Trap' generate a lot of buzz and interest, this could push the opening weekend gross above $20 million. Considering these factors, while there's no guarantee of success, the combination of Shyamalan's track record, the performance of similar films, and the potential for strong marketing and anticipation suggest that 'Trap' has a reasonable chance of grossing more than $20 million during its domestic opening weekend."}, "prob": 0.7}, "prob": 0.7, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.737, "brier_score": 0.49, "brier_score_scaled": -96.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.7906, "calibrated_prob": 0.43, "brier_score": 0.1849, "brier_score_scaled": 26.0, "log_score": 0.8109}}

Recent trends and announcements: Disney has been investing heavily in new attractions, shows, and experiences across its parks, including the Magic Kingdom. This trend suggests that the company is continually looking to enhance the guest experience and stay competitive. 2. D23 as a platform for announcements: D23 Expo is a significant event for Disney, serving as a platform to announce new projects, attractions, and experiences. Given its importance, it's plausible that Disney would use this opportunity to reveal a new night parade, especially if it aligns with their current development timelines. 3. Night parades' popularity and rotation: Night parades are popular among Disney guests and contribute to the magical experience of the parks. Disney periodically updates and rotates these parades to keep the experience fresh for repeat visitors. The absence of a new night parade announcement for the Magic Kingdom in recent years might suggest that the time is ripe for such an announcement. 4. Competition and market dynamics: The theme park market is competitive, with other parks continually updating their offerings. Disney might see the introduction of a new night parade as a strategic move to maintain its market position and attract visitors. 5. Internal factors and planning timelines: While we can't know Disney's internal planning and decision-making processes, the company typically plans its major announcements and project unveilings well in advance. If a new night parade is in the works, D23 2024 could be an opportune time to announce it, given the typical timelines for such projects.

In general, it is relatively rare for a large number of Senators from the same party to publicly call for their party's president to drop out, especially if the president is not facing an imminent election or a severe scandal. However, the fact that there is a dedicated New York Times interactive page tracking this issue suggests that there may be some momentum or interest in this topic. Given the time frame of less than a week before the resolution date, it is uncertain whether 10 or more Senators will make such calls.

These organizations have a strong track record of breaking news stories, often with advance notice. 2. Advance notice: A 6-hour window is a relatively short period for a major news story. However, in today's fast-paced news environment, where journalists and news organizations closely follow political developments, it's plausible that a reliable media outlet could obtain unofficial confirmation of Biden's dropout and report on it before the official announcement. 3. Unofficial confirmation: The question allows for unofficial confirmation, which means that the media outlet doesn't need to have direct confirmation from Biden himself. This could come from sources close to the Biden campaign, party officials, or other insiders. 4. Motivation to break the story: News organizations are often driven by the desire to break exclusive stories and gain a competitive edge. If a reliable media outlet has credible information about Biden's dropout, they would likely want to report on it as soon as possible to be the first to break the news. 5. Past precedents: There have been instances in the past where major news outlets have broken stories about significant political developments, including candidate dropouts, ahead of official announcements.

To answer this question, we need to consider the differences in how respondents might perceive Trump when paired with a specific opponent (Biden) versus a generic Democrat. In general, public opinion polls have shown that Biden tends to perform worse than other Democrats when paired with Trump. This could be due to various factors, such as Biden's relatively low favorability ratings or the perception that he is too moderate or too old. On the other hand, a generic Democrat might be seen as a more appealing alternative to Trump, as respondents may project their ideal candidate onto the generic option. Given these considerations, it's possible that Trump might gain some support when facing Biden specifically, as respondents may view Biden as a weaker opponent. However, the question asks whether Trump will gain at least 3%, which is a relatively significant margin.

First, the director, Lee Isaac Chung, has received critical acclaim for his previous work, 'Minari', which won several awards, including the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. This suggests that he has a track record of producing high-quality films that resonate with critics. Second, the cast, including Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar Jones, have both shown promise in their previous roles, with Powell receiving praise for his performance in 'Top Gun: Maverick' and Jones earning critical acclaim for her role in 'Normal People'. A talented cast can contribute to a film's overall quality and critical reception. Third, the fact that 'Twisters' is a standalone sequel to the 1996 original, which has a Tomatometer score of 63%, suggests that the new film may have a similar or potentially higher score, given the advancements in filmmaking technology and the experience of the director and cast. However, it's also important to note that sequels can be unpredictable, and the critical reception of a film is ultimately subjective. There is always a risk that the film may not meet expectations or that critics may be overly harsh. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of 'Twisters' (2024) having a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of at least 75% to be around 0.6.

Given the current trend of revamping and reimagining classic attractions, it's plausible that Disney might consider reviving the Peoplemover in some form. Moreover, the D23 Expo is a significant event where Disney often announces new projects, expansions, and attractions. The fact that the question specifically mentions the Disney Experiences Showcase on August 10, 2024, suggests that the announcement might be a part of a larger presentation or panel discussion. However, it's essential to note that the question requires the new attraction to meet specific criteria, such as having portions with views above Tomorrowland and incorporating at least two of the mentioned characteristics (e.g., using existing track structure, rebuilding the station, etc.).
