Let's say 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. So, not_P would be 1 - P, which is 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend)**: Since this is essentially the same as P, I would assign it the same value, 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference)**: Given Musk's active engagement in the cryptocurrency space, I would estimate this probability to be high, around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This is a joint probability, and I would estimate it using the formula P_and_Q = P * Q, assuming independence. So, P_and_Q = 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P occurs)**: This would be a more complex calculation, but for simplicity, I might estimate it as Q * not_P, which gives Q_and_not_P = 0.70 * 0.35 = 0.245.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: This is a conditional probability and can be estimated as Q_given_P = Q / P, which gives Q_given_P = 0.70 / 0.65 = 1.077, but since probabilities cannot exceed 1, I would cap it at 1.0.\n\nOverall, I believe these estimates are reasonable based on the context and relationships between the events. I will now check these estimates against the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.46,\nP_or_Q: 0.89,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 1.00\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.89 + 0.46 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.89 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.89 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 1.00 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, or consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.46,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 1.00\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "82de541f-594f-4b3a-8a96-979cf5271090", "title": "Is it expected that Iran will execute a lethal assault inside Israel by May 1, 2024?", "body": "This question will be answered with a **Yes** if, after the publication date of this question and before May 1, 2024, there are credible reports of an attack linked to Iran that takes place within Israel's borders and results in the death of at least five people.", "resolution_date": "2024-05-01T17:53:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-10T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-26T17:12:44.990553", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d205d63f-5a46-4b58-a2bb-6c28810bae6e'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('68db4565-8580-450d-b08e-e8e74aec4927'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('f26f5ebd-0503-4c2b-a62f-653600962842'), title='Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('563341f3-679f-423f-944b-566d30ad8556'), title='Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This question will resolve YES if Elon Musk publicly discusses Bitcoin in any form during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 conference, regardless of his attendance on stage.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 27, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_and_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('dc12b1c1-e1ef-4af4-9f64-6b15fee7e94a'), title='Will both of the following occur during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024: (a) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?

However, factors such as his schedule and other commitments could impact this.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P, and thus it is directly influenced by the estimate for P. If I estimate a 0.70 for P, then not_P would be 0.30.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of Elon Musk attending)**: This is similar to P, so I would expect it to have a similar probability estimate, indicating the high interest in his participation.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: Given his active engagement on social media and public platforms, I estimate a higher probability for this event, independent of his attendance.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability should be lower than either P or Q, as both events must occur simultaneously. I estimate this based on the independence of the two events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one of P or Q occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the occurrence of either event. I calculate this using the formula for the union of two probabilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs but not P)**: This scenario would depend on estimating Q while assuming P does not happen. It should be less than Q since it adds the condition that P does not happen.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. I would estimate this based on how likely Musk is to make a statement if he is present.\n\nOverall, I must ensure that the estimates I provide obey the consistency rules outlined, particularly those concerning the relationships between probabilities. For instance, the sum of probabilities for P and not_P should equal 1, and the estimates for P_and_Q and P_or_Q must adhere to their respective formulas based on the independent probabilities of P and Q.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.90 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.90 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given Musk's previous involvement in Bitcoin discussions and events, I estimate a moderate probability (for example, 0.60) that he will show up. \n\n**not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, thus it will be estimated as 1 - P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. \n\n**para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same question as P, so I expect this to have the same probability as P (0.60). \n\n**Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is somewhat independent of whether he shows up or not, as he could make a statement even if he doesn't attend. However, I expect that if he does attend, the likelihood of him making a statement increases. I estimate this probability at 0.50, considering his history of public statements about Bitcoin. \n\n**P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability should be calculated based on the joint occurrence of both events. If we assume that P and Q are somewhat correlated (i.e., if he shows up, he is more likely to make a statement), I might estimate this around 0.30. \n\n**P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This will involve the union of the probabilities of P and Q. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.50, I would calculate this using the formula for the union of two probabilities, which might yield a value around 0.80. \n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?)**: This assesses the situation where he makes a statement but does not show up. Given our estimates, I would expect this to be lower than P_and_Q, possibly around 0.20. \n\n**Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will he make a public statement about Bitcoin?)**: This conditional probability should be high if P is true, perhaps around 0.70. \n\nIn summary, I will assign probabilities based on the relationships and dependencies among these events, ensuring that they comply with the consistency rules outlined.

I could estimate a moderate probability for this event, considering Musk's active engagement with the cryptocurrency community.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. The probability of not_P should be calculated as 1 - P. Thus, if P is estimated at a certain value, not_P will naturally follow.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is similar to P and should have a close probability estimate, as both questions are essentially asking about the same event. I would expect para_P to be roughly equal to P.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is somewhat independent, as it does not necessarily depend on his attendance. However, if he does attend, the likelihood of him making a statement may increase. Thus, I would estimate Q to be a bit higher than the chance of him attending.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The probability of both events happening should be lower than either P or Q alone. Thus, I would estimate this value based on the individual probabilities of P and Q, considering the relationship between them. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This should be higher than either P or Q, as it accounts for both possibilities. I would derive this using the formula for the union of two probabilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?)**: This is a more complex interaction, as it requires Q to happen while P does not. I would estimate this based on the independence of Q from P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability could be estimated based on the assumption that if Musk attends, he is more likely to make a statement. Therefore, I would expect this value to be higher than the unconditional probability of Q.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that my estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, especially considering the relationships between P and not_P, as well as the joint and conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.40 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "b9b45085-c107-456f-8af6-7546b87e196b", "title": "Will Croatia advance to the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final?", "body": "This question will be answered with a **Yes** if Croatia competes in a Semi-final and is subsequently declared by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to have advanced to the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Given his previous engagements and interest in Bitcoin, I would estimate a moderate probability for this event, perhaps around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P. Its probability will be derived directly from P, ensuring that P + not_P = 1, which is a fundamental consistency rule.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance Musk will attend)**: This is similar to P, so I expect it to have a similar probability. However, I might assign it a slightly higher value, reflecting the more general nature of the question (0.65).\n\n4. **Q (Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: This event is somewhat independent of P, as he could make a statement without attending. Given Musk's history of commenting on Bitcoin, I would estimate this probability at around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This is a joint probability that requires both events to be true. I would estimate this as the product of their individual probabilities, adjusted for any potential overlap (e.g., if attendance increases the likelihood of making a statement).\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability will be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle, ensuring that we account for the overlap between P and Q appropriately.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not_P occurs)**: This situation would require that Musk makes a statement without showing up, which is plausible but less likely than either event occurring separately. I would assign a lower probability to this scenario.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q given P)**: This conditional probability will reflect the likelihood of Musk making a statement if he does show up. Given that attendance may lead to public statements, I would expect this to be higher than the unconditional probability of Q. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that all estimates adhere to the consistency rules, particularly those governing complements, conjunctions, and disjunctions.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.78,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.78 + 0.42 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.78 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.78 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.85 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.65 is FALSE\n\npara consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.78,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0026707053388299595, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013353526694149798, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his past involvement, I might estimate this probability to be relatively high, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attendance)**: This is essentially the same as P, so it will also be around 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Public statement about Bitcoin)**: Musk has a history of making statements about Bitcoin, so I would estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This would be calculated using the multiplication rule, assuming some degree of independence between showing up and making a statement. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.70, then P_and_Q could be estimated as P * Q = 0.60 * 0.70 = 0.42.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.70, then P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.70 - 0.42 = 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Statement made, but not showing up)**: This would require some estimation of the probability that Musk makes a statement without attending, which might be lower than Q alone.

I will assign a relatively high probability based on his previous engagements with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency events, as well as the significance of this conference. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P. Given the assignment of P, not_P will be calculated as 1 - P. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance of Musk attending)**: This question is similar to P but is phrased differently. Since it essentially asks the same thing, I will assign it a probability similar to that of P. \n\n4. **Q (Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: This question is independent of P but may correlate with it. If he attends, the likelihood of him making a statement increases. I will assign a moderate probability to this based on the context of the event. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q individually since it requires both events to occur. I will calculate it based on the probabilities of P and Q. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This will be higher than both P and Q individually since it allows for either event happening. I will calculate it using the appropriate formula for the union of two events. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P)**: This question is interesting because it requires that Musk makes a statement but does not show up. This is possible, so I will assign a lower probability based on the likelihood of him making a statement without attending. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This is a conditional probability that will likely be high because if Musk shows up, he is more likely to make a statement. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that the assignments obey the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the relationships between the events and ensuring that the probabilities adhere to the constraints set by the rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.55 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{failed_check_cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0026707053388299595, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013353526694149798, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his interest in Bitcoin, I estimate a moderate to high probability of him attending, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, calculated as 1 - P. Therefore, if P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same question as P, so I will assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This probability will depend on his general engagement with Bitcoin and whether he feels the need to make a statement at this conference. Given his history of public statements about Bitcoin, I estimate this probability at around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q, as both events need to happen. I will estimate this as the product of the two probabilities, assuming independence: P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This can be calculated using the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while not_P occurs?)**: This is a bit tricky as it requires Q to happen while not_P is true. If Musk makes a statement but does not show up, the chance is reduced. I will estimate this at around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability will likely be higher than Q alone, as attendance may increase the likelihood of making a statement. I will estimate this at around 0.80.\n\nAfter establishing these probabilities, I will check them against the consistency rules to ensure they adhere to the mathematical relationships defined.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.46,\nP_or_Q: 0.89,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.89 + 0.46 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.89 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.89 - 0.20 is FALSE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and, but, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "1a17caaf-6dde-4f90-a0e2-183a9b3aed51", "title": "Will the United States lead the medal count at the 2024 Paris Olympics?", "body": "This inquiry will be affirmed if the United States Olympic Team secures the top position as the sole leader in the rankings at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

However, there are uncertainties regarding his schedule and other commitments.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at a certain probability, not_P will be 1 minus that probability. Therefore, if P is high, not_P will be low, and vice versa.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is similar to P, so I would expect it to have a similar probability, reflecting the likelihood of his attendance.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Musk has a history of making public statements about Bitcoin, especially during significant events. Therefore, I would assign a moderate to high probability for this event as well.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This event's probability must consider the intersection of P and Q. If both events are somewhat independent, I can use the multiplication rule for independent events, but if they are dependent, I must adjust accordingly.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q alone, but it cannot exceed 1. This is calculated as the sum of the probabilities of P and Q minus the probability of both occurring (P_and_Q).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This event is interesting as it reflects a scenario where Musk makes a statement but does not show up. This will require careful consideration of the relationship between Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of Q occurring if we know P has occurred. This is crucial as it can be higher than the unconditional probability of Q if P influences Q positively.\n\nIn terms of independence, P and Q may not be entirely independent, as Musk's attendance could influence whether he makes a statement about Bitcoin. Therefore, I must carefully consider the relationships between these probabilities when estimating their values.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

I will assign a probability based on the general perception of Elon Musk's interest in Bitcoin and his attendance at major events. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Since this is the negation of P, it will be calculated as 1 - P. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is expected to be equal to P since both questions essentially ask about the same event, just phrased differently.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference)**: This event could occur independently of his attendance. However, his presence might increase the likelihood of making a statement. I'll assign a probability considering his history of public statements about Bitcoin.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This will be determined by the multiplication of the probabilities of P and Q, reflecting the likelihood of both events happening together.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This will need to account for the overlap between P and Q, ensuring that both probabilities are included without double counting the intersection (P_and_Q).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This is a scenario where Musk makes a statement without showing up.

The key probabilities to estimate are whether he will show up at the conference (P), whether he will not show up (not_P), whether he will make a public statement about Bitcoin (Q), and whether both events (P and Q) will occur. \n\n1. **P (Show Up)**: This probability reflects the likelihood of Elon Musk attending the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 conference. Given his previous engagement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I estimate this to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (Not Show Up)**: This is the complement of P. If P is high, not_P will be low. I will estimate this based on the assumption of P.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of Attendance)**: Given that para_P is essentially another way of asking about P, it will likely have the same probability as P.\n\n4. **Q (Public Statement)**: This reflects the likelihood of him discussing Bitcoin at the conference. Given his history of public statements on Bitcoin, this probability might be moderate to high.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events)**: For both P and Q to occur, the probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both to happen simultaneously. I will estimate this based on the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event)**: This probability will be higher than the individual probabilities of P and Q, as it encompasses both scenarios. I will calculate this using the formula for the union of two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This scenario considers the likelihood of Musk making a public statement without attending the conference. This is plausible, especially if he chooses to discuss Bitcoin remotely or through other media.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability will estimate the likelihood of Musk making a public statement given that he shows up at the conference. This will likely be higher than Q alone, as his attendance could encourage discussion.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities align with the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, Q, and their combinations. The independence of events will also be considered, as P and Q may be correlated but are not entirely dependent on one another.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.55,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.55 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.55 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.55 / 0.85 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.55,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0026707053388299595, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013353526694149798, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his interest in Bitcoin, I would estimate a moderate probability for this event, around 0.60, considering his past engagements at similar events.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 0.40 (1 - 0.60).\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so it would also be around 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Public statement about Bitcoin)**: Musk is known for making statements about Bitcoin, so I would assign a probability of around 0.70 for him making a public statement during the conference.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both showing up and making a statement)**: This would be a product of the probabilities of P and Q, adjusted for their correlation. Given that if he shows up, he is likely to make a statement, I would estimate this to be around 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either showing up or making a statement)**: This would involve the union of the two events. I would estimate this to be around 0.80, as there is a high likelihood that at least one of the two will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Making a statement without showing up)**: This is more nuanced, as it would depend on whether he makes a statement remotely. I would estimate this to be around 0.20, as it is plausible but less likely.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Making a statement given he shows up)**: If he shows up, the likelihood of him making a statement increases significantly, so I would assign this a high probability of around 0.90.\n\nOverall, the predictions are interrelated, with P and Q being independent events but influencing each other in certain contexts (e.g., if he shows up, he is more likely to make a statement). The estimates will need to follow the consistency rules outlined to ensure they are mathematically sound.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.90,\npara_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.50 / 0.90 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.90,\npara_P: 0.60\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "8344228c-2803-48c4-9056-a094fd9ba034", "title": "Will Wesley So defeat Hans Niemann in the Speed Chess Championship?", "body": "The game is scheduled for August 7th at 18:00 GMT.\n\nhttps://www.chess.com/events/2024-speed-chess-championship-main-event/games\n\nIf the match is called off, it will be considered N/A.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-08T04:13:50Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-08-01T19:48:54Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-26T17:12:46.272611", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d205d63f-5a46-4b58-a2bb-6c28810bae6e'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('68db4565-8580-450d-b08e-e8e74aec4927'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('f26f5ebd-0503-4c2b-a62f-653600962842'), title='Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('563341f3-679f-423f-944b-566d30ad8556'), title='Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This question will resolve YES if Elon Musk publicly discusses Bitcoin in any form during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 conference, regardless of his attendance on stage.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 27, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_and_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('dc12b1c1-e1ef-4af4-9f64-6b15fee7e94a'), title='Will both of the following occur during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024: (a) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?

However, there are uncertainties regarding his schedule and commitments, leading me to estimate a probability of around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P and thus should be calculated as 1 - P, leading to an estimate of approximately 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same question as P, so I expect this to have the same probability estimate of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is somewhat independent of P, as he could make a statement without attending. Given his active engagement with Bitcoin, I estimate this at about 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This requires both P and Q to be true. I estimate this probability to be lower than either P or Q alone because it\u2019s a conjunction. I estimate around 0.45.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is a disjunction, so I expect it to be higher than both individual probabilities. I estimate this at about 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while P does not?)**: This is a more complex relationship, as it requires Q to be true while P is false. I estimate this at around 0.25, considering the independence of Q from P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability should be relatively high, as Musk's attendance may lead to a statement.

I estimate a moderate probability of 0.60 based on his previous engagements with Bitcoin events and his public persona.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. Therefore, I estimate this as 0.40 (1 - 0.60).\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I will set it to 0.60 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Given his history of making statements about Bitcoin, I estimate this probability at 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This combines both events. I will estimate this at 0.50, considering that both events are somewhat correlated but not perfectly dependent.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Substituting the values gives me 0.60 + 0.70 - 0.50 = 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?)**: This is a more complex event, but I estimate this at 0.15 based on the likelihood that he could make a statement without attending.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This is a conditional probability. If he shows up, the likelihood that he will make a statement increases, so I estimate this at 0.85.\n\nOverall, I believe the estimates reflect a reasonable assumption based on historical data and the nature of the events in question.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.50 / 0.85 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_cond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.59\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0026707053388299595, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013353526694149798, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his past involvement in similar events and the significant interest in Bitcoin, I estimate a relatively high probability that he will attend, perhaps around 0.70.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially a rephrasing of P, so I would assign it the same probability as P, 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Musk is known for his public statements on Bitcoin, and given the timing of the conference, I believe there's a moderate probability he will make a statement, perhaps 0.60.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The occurrence of both events is dependent on Musk attending and making a statement. I would estimate this probability to be lower than either P or Q alone, perhaps around 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than either individual probability but less than 1. I would estimate it at approximately 0.80, considering that it's likely at least one of the events will happen.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?)**: This scenario involves Musk making a statement while not attending, which is less likely. I would assign a lower probability, perhaps around 0.15.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: If Musk attends, the likelihood of him making a statement increases. I would estimate this at around 0.85.\n\nIn summary, the estimates are interrelated. If P is high, not_P is low. Similarly, if Q is high, then Q_and_not_P is low. The estimates should respect the consistency rules provided, which govern the relationships between these probabilities. For example, the values for P_and_Q must be less than or equal to both P and Q, and P_or_Q must be greater than or equal to the maximum of P and Q.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.70, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.60) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.50 / 0.85 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "74256d76-a3a6-4148-b9f8-c60cbdc10e19", "title": "Is Doug Burgum going to be chosen as the Republican candidate for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This inquiry will be answered with a **Yes** if Doug Burgum is chosen by the Republican National Convention as the candidate for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Factors such as the conference's relevance to his interests and public persona will play a role. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This probability is simply the complement of P, which means if P is estimated at, say, 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This question is similar to P and should have the same probability since it asks about the same event. \n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Given Musk's history of engaging with Bitcoin publicly, I would assign a reasonable probability to this event, but it may be slightly lower than P since it doesn't necessarily require his attendance. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability will depend on the individual probabilities of P and Q. If both are likely, then P_and_Q should also be reasonably high, but it cannot exceed the individual probabilities of P and Q. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This would be calculated based on the probabilities of P and Q, ensuring it does not exceed 1 and follows the rules of probability. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and not_P occurs)**: This situation is possible if Musk makes a statement without attending, so it will be a function of Q and not_P. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability is likely to be higher than Q alone since if Musk attends, he may be inclined to make a statement. \n\nIn summary, I will assign probabilities based on these considerations while ensuring they adhere to the consistency rules provided.

Given his previous engagements with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complementary event to P, and it should equal 1 - P. Therefore, I estimate not_P to be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend)**: As para_P is essentially the same as P in this context, I will assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference)**: This event can occur independently of his attendance. Given Musk's active engagement with social media and public discourse about Bitcoin, I estimate a probability of 0.70 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This event requires both P and Q to occur. Given the probabilities of P and Q, I estimate P_and_Q to be 0.45, which reflects a reasonable overlap between these two events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This is a logical OR event, and I can calculate it using the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Substituting the values, I get P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.45 = 0.90.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P occurs)**: This event is more complex as it requires Q to occur while P does not.

This reflects the general expectation that Musk, being a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, may choose to attend such an event. \n\n**not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Given the probability of P, I estimate not_P at 0.40, which is simply 1 - P. This reflects the complementary nature of the two events. \n\n**para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This aligns with my estimate for P, hence I set it at 0.60 as well. \n\n**Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference)**: I estimate this at 0.65, considering Musk's history of making statements about Bitcoin and his active engagement with the cryptocurrency community. \n\n**P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: I estimate this at 0.50, reflecting the idea that while there is a reasonable chance that both events can occur, they are not completely independent. If Musk attends the conference, there\u2019s a good chance he may speak about Bitcoin. \n\n**P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: Given the probabilities of P and Q, I estimate this at 0.75. This reflects the likelihood that at least one of the two events will happen, which is supported by the individual probabilities. \n\n**Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: I estimate this at 0.25, indicating that there\u2019s a reasonable chance Musk could make a statement about Bitcoin without attending the conference. \n\n**Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: I estimate this at 0.70, suggesting that if Musk does show up, he is likely to make a statement about Bitcoin. \n\nOverall, these estimates are interrelated, and I've ensured that they align with the consistency rules. The estimates for P and not_P complement each other, while the probabilities for P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P consider potential dependencies between the events. I will need to check these probabilities against the consistency rules to ensure they hold true.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nQ: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.70,\npara_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.75 + 0.50 - 0.65 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.65 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.60, 0.65) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.65) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.65) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.75 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.50 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nQ: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.70,\npara_P: 0.60\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0026707053388299595, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013353526694149798, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This takes into account his past engagement with cryptocurrency and Bitcoin-related events. However, considering the uncertainty of his attendance at a specific conference, I also estimate the probability of him not showing up (not_P) to be 0.40.\n\nFor the question regarding whether there is a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (para_P), I would align this with the probability of him showing up (P) since they are essentially the same event, thus estimating it at 0.60.\n\nRegarding the public statement about Bitcoin during the conference (Q), I would estimate this at 0.50. While there is a reasonable chance he may make comments about Bitcoin, it is not guaranteed.\n\nThe joint occurrence of Musk showing up at the event and making a public statement about Bitcoin (P_and_Q) would be estimated at 0.30, as both events are somewhat dependent on each other. If he shows up, he is more likely to speak, but there is still uncertainty.\n\nFor the probability of either event occurring (P_or_Q), I would estimate this at 0.70, as it encompasses the likelihood of at least one of the events happening.\n\nThe scenario where Musk makes a public statement but does not show up (Q_and_not_P) could be estimated at 0.20, as it is less likely but still possible that he might comment without attending.\n\nFinally, given that he shows up at the event, the probability that he will make a public statement (Q_given_P) could be estimated at 0.80, as his presence would significantly increase the chances of him speaking.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.50) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "046b74d6-aec1-44a8-8066-f565ac26322c", "title": "Will OpenAI's ChatGPT be accessible to the general public in the EU on June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question will be answered with a **YES** if [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) is accessible to the general public in the EU on June 30, 2024, and **NO** if it is not.\n\n\"Accessible to the general public\" means that the default situation for individuals in the EU is that they can reach it without the need for a VPN (although they might need to pay for access).

The key questions include whether he will show up at the event (P), whether he will not show up (not_P), and whether he will make a public statement about Bitcoin (Q). \n\n1. **P (Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a binary event that will resolve positively if Musk appears on stage. The probability may be influenced by his past attendance at similar events and his public interest in Bitcoin.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P, so its probability is directly related to P. If P is high, not_P should be low, and vice versa.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is essentially similar to P, so we expect the probabilities to align closely.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This event is independent of P; Musk could make a statement regardless of his attendance. However, if he attends, the likelihood of him making a statement may increase.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability depends on both P and Q. If either P or Q is unlikely, this combined event will also be less likely.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This event will be more likely than either P or Q alone, as it includes the possibility of either happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?)**: This event is particularly interesting because it requires Musk to make a statement without showing up, which could happen if he engages remotely.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability needs to be evaluated in the context of whether Musk's attendance increases the likelihood of him making a statement.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: P and Q are not strictly independent; the occurrence of one may influence the probability of the other. For instance, if Musk shows up (P), he might be more inclined to make a statement (Q). However, they are not mutually exclusive, as he can make a statement regardless of his attendance.

I would need to consider how likely it is for both events to happen together, which may be influenced by the nature of the conference and Musk's agenda.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it includes the possibility of either event happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while not P occurs?)**: This is a more complex scenario, as it requires both a public statement and no attendance. I would estimate this probability as relatively low, given that Musk's public statements often coincide with his appearances at significant events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability would likely be high, as Musk making a statement about Bitcoin is more plausible if he is present at the event. \n\nOverall, I will ensure that my estimates for these probabilities adhere to the consistency rules, particularly those related to complements, joint probabilities, and conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "44a3a90c-436e-4f94-8e66-b2ec6d6ea338", "title": "Will BJP form the government after the next Indian general election in 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if the BJP has a member sworn in as the next Indian Prime Minister following the next general elections.

Given the timing of the conference and his engagement with the topic, I estimate a moderate probability of him making a statement.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This is the joint probability of both attending and making a statement. Given that both events are likely but not guaranteed, I would estimate this probability lower than either P or Q individually.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability must be higher than either P or Q alone since it encompasses the likelihood of either event happening. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This is a scenario where Musk makes a statement but does not attend. This is less likely since if he is making a public statement, he may also choose to attend, but it is still possible.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability considers the likelihood of him making a statement if he is present.

Given his prominence in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.65 that he will attend. \n\n**not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, so I estimate it to be 0.35. \n\n**para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is essentially a rephrasing of P, so I assign it the same probability of 0.65. \n\n**Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of making public statements about Bitcoin, I estimate this probability to be around 0.70. \n\n**P_and_Q (Will both occur: Musk shows up and makes a statement?)**: The occurrence of both events is less likely than either occurring alone. I estimate this probability to be 0.45, factoring in the dependence between the two events. \n\n**P_or_Q (Will either occur: Musk shows up or makes a statement?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone but lower than the sum of both probabilities. I estimate it to be 0.80. \n\n**Q_and_not_P (Will Musk make a statement but not show up?)**: This scenario is plausible if Musk chooses to make a statement remotely or through other channels. I estimate this probability to be 0.25. \n\n**Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will he make a statement?)**: If Musk attends, the likelihood that he will make a statement increases. I estimate this probability to be around 0.85.\n\nIn summary, I expect all these events to have interrelated probabilities, with P and Q being positively correlated.

The key variables are:  \n\n1. **P**: The probability that Elon Musk will show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024.  \n2. **not_P**: The probability that Elon Musk will not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024.  \n3. **para_P**: The probability that there is a chance Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024.  \n4. **Q**: The probability that Elon Musk will make a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference.  \n5. **P_and_Q**: The probability that both P and Q will occur.  \n6. **P_or_Q**: The probability that either P or Q will occur.  \n7. **Q_and_not_P**: The probability that Q occurs while P does not.  \n8. **Q_given_P**: The probability that Q occurs given that P has occurred.  \n\n### Reasoning for Probability Estimates:  \n- **P** is likely influenced by Elon Musk's prior engagements and public interest in Bitcoin, leading to a moderate probability estimate (e.g., 0.60).  \n- **not_P** directly relates to **P**, and should be calculated as 1 - P.  \n- **para_P** is closely related to **P** and should reflect similar probabilities; hence, it might also be around 0.60.  \n- **Q** depends on Musk's public statements about Bitcoin. If he has shown interest in Bitcoin, this might have a probability of around 0.50.  \n- **P_and_Q** should reflect the joint occurrence of both events, likely lower than either individual probability due to the intersection.

Given his previous involvement in Bitcoin discussions and events, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for him showing up.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 1 - P. Thus, not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, so I would assign it the same probability, which is 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Public statement about Bitcoin)**: Given Musk's history of making statements about Bitcoin, I estimate a probability of 0.70 that he will make a public statement during the conference.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both show up and make a statement)**: This probability would be the joint occurrence of P and Q. Given that these events are not completely independent, I estimate this at 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either show up or make a statement)**: This is the probability that either event occurs. Given that P and Q are somewhat correlated, I estimate this at 0.85.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Make a statement but not show up)**: This scenario is plausible since Musk could make a statement without attending. I estimate this probability at 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Statement given attendance)**: If Musk shows up, I would expect a higher likelihood of him making a statement. I estimate this at 0.80.\n\nIn terms of consistency rules, I will ensure that the probabilities adhere to the mathematical relationships defined in the CONSISTENCY RULES.

Given his active involvement in the cryptocurrency space, I might estimate this probability to be relatively high.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, and its value will depend on how likely I think he is to attend the event.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance Elon Musk will attend)**: This is similar to P, so I expect this to have a similar probability as P, given that they are essentially asking the same question.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: The probability of him making a statement could be influenced by his recent activities and statements regarding Bitcoin. If he has been vocal about Bitcoin recently, I would assign a higher probability to this.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability would be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be true. I would estimate it based on the joint likelihood of both events happening.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability is expected to be higher than either P or Q alone since it allows for either event to occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs but not P)**: This scenario is plausible if Musk makes a statement without attending. The probability would depend on how often he makes statements without being present at events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given that P occurs)**: This conditional probability would typically be higher than the overall probability of Q since if he shows up, he may be more likely to make a statement.\n\nIn terms of independence, P and Q are not entirely independent since Musk's attendance may influence whether he makes a statement. Therefore, I need to carefully consider how these probabilities interact with each other when assigning values.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.50) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.60 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.32,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "a61b7f53-8dc4-49e6-b612-22dac613bc96", "title": "Will Michael Lodge secure a third term as Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority in the July elections?", "body": "The outcome will be **Yes** if the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and/or [reliable sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) confirm that the current Secretary-General Michael Lodge has been re-elected for a third term during the July elections.

Given his past involvement with Bitcoin and the high-profile nature of the event, I would estimate a moderate probability, let's say around 0.60, reflecting a reasonable chance of attendance.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P, and I would assign it the same probability as P, which is 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of engaging with Bitcoin publicly, I would estimate this probability at around 0.70, as he may still comment on Bitcoin regardless of his attendance.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The occurrence of both P and Q is dependent on Musk attending and making a statement. Assuming a moderate correlation, I would estimate this at around 0.40.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is a broader question. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.70, I would estimate this at around 0.80, accounting for the overlap between P and Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This is a more complex scenario, but I would estimate this at a lower probability, say around 0.15, as it relies on Musk making a statement without attending.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: If Musk shows up, the likelihood of him making a statement increases. Hence, I would estimate this at around 0.85.\n\nIn summary, I would assign the following probabilities based on the reasoning above, ensuring they align with the consistency rules. Each question is interrelated, with P and Q being the most significant, and their probabilities reflecting the likelihood of their occurrence.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.40 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.40 / 0.85 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, or, cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0026707053388299595, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013353526694149798, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
