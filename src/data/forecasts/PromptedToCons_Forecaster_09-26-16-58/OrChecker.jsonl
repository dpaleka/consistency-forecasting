Given Musk's public persona and history with Bitcoin, I estimate a moderate likelihood of him attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P and should logically reflect the remaining probability. If P is set to a certain value, not_P should equal 1 minus that value.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attending)**: This is closely related to P, as it essentially asks the same question but in a slightly different phrasing. Therefore, I expect this probability to align closely with P.\n\n4. **Q (Public statement about Bitcoin)**: Musk's history of making statements about Bitcoin and his influence in the cryptocurrency space suggest that there is a reasonable chance he will make a statement during the conference, regardless of his attendance.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both attending and making a statement)**: The probability of both events occurring is typically lower than either event occurring alone. I estimate this probability based on the likelihood of each event happening independently.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either attending or making a statement)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses the possibility of either event occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Making a statement without attending)**: This situation is plausible since Musk could make a public statement without being physically present. I estimate this probability based on the independence of the two events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Making a statement given attendance)**: If Musk attends, the likelihood of him making a statement should increase. Therefore, I would expect this probability to be higher than the overall probability of making a statement.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided, checking for relationships like complements, intersections, and unions to maintain logical coherence.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.33,\nP_or_Q: 0.82,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.22,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.82 + 0.33 - 0.55 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.33 <= min(0.60, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.55) <= 0.82 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.55) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.82 - 0.22 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.33 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, or consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.22,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "5f6acc26-df54-4b6b-8dfa-e9b0ad393067", "title": "Will Nikki Haley be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Nikki Haley is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The probability of this happening could be influenced by Musk's general interest in Bitcoin and his past attendance at similar events. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P. The two probabilities must sum to 1, which means if we have a high probability for P, not_P will be low, and vice versa. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so we expect it to have the same probability. \n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: This event is somewhat independent of P. Musk could make a statement whether or not he attends the conference. However, his attendance might increase the likelihood of making a statement. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability should be less than or equal to both P and Q because it represents the intersection of the two events. If the probabilities of P and Q are high, we would expect a higher probability for P_and_Q, but it can never exceed either P or Q. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability should be at least as high as the maximum of P and Q and at most the sum of P and Q minus the probability of both occurring (P_and_Q). It captures the likelihood of at least one of the events happening. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This captures a scenario where Musk makes a statement without showing up. The probability should be positive if we believe Musk could make a statement without attending. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q given P)**: This conditional probability should be high if we believe Musk's attendance would significantly increase the chances of him making a statement.\n\nIn summary, the interdependencies and relationships between these questions will guide the assignment of probabilities, ensuring they all align with the consistency rules provided. Each probability must be carefully calibrated to ensure that they respect the mathematical constraints outlined in the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.50) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.50) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.60 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.39,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "95b9093e-1f86-4375-9015-4c2399d88f66", "title": "Will either Donald Trump Jr. or Nikki Haley be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Donald Trump Jr. or Nikki Haley is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his history of involvement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, there is a reasonable chance he may attend. I estimate a probability of 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same question as P, so I will assign the same probability of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This depends on whether he attends and his willingness to engage with the media. I will estimate this probability at 0.50, considering both his past statements and the context of the conference.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This requires both P and Q to happen. Assuming independence for simplicity, I can calculate this as P * Q = 0.60 * 0.50 = 0.30.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q.

Given his past involvement in cryptocurrency discussions, I would estimate a moderate probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complementary event to P.

However, his attendance might increase the likelihood of him making a statement. Therefore, I would assign a lower probability compared to P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability should reflect the intersection of P and Q, which would be lower than either individual probability since it requires both events to occur simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the possibility of either event happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This event requires Q to happen while P does not, which can be estimated based on the independence of Q from P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability should be high if P is true since Musk's attendance may lead to a public statement.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities need to reflect the relationships between these events, ensuring that the total probabilities adhere to the consistency rules, such as the complementary relationship between P and not_P, the bounds on P_and_Q, and the independence or dependence of Q on P.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.50) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.32,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "579be34d-93d1-4ee0-b1dd-a1e47ef0aa18", "title": "Will Mike Pence be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Mike Pence is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Factors influencing this include his previous engagements at similar events and the importance of Bitcoin in his public persona. \n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30. This reflects the possibility that he may have other commitments or choose not to attend.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I expect it to have the same probability.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: I estimate a moderate probability here as well, considering that Musk often discusses Bitcoin publicly, regardless of his attendance at the event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: For this to happen, both events must occur simultaneously. I estimate this probability lower than either P or Q individually, as the intersection of these two events is less likely than either occurring alone.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, representing the likelihood of at least one event occurring. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur if not_P occurs?)**: This reflects a scenario where Musk makes a statement without attending. I estimate this probability based on historical behavior where he has commented on Bitcoin without being present at events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q also occur?)**: This conditional probability should be high if I believe that Musk's attendance would likely lead to a public statement about Bitcoin.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these events are interconnected, particularly P and Q, which are mutually influential. I will assign probabilities that respect the consistency rules outlined, ensuring that complementary and conditional relationships are accurately represented.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.70, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.60) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.80 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.50 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "0791f664-4287-45fc-b228-c4e9ad2e4541", "title": "Will either Vivek Ramaswamy or Mike Pence be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Vivek Ramaswamy or Mike Pence is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

I estimate this probability around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Since this is essentially the same question as P, I will assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Given Musk's history with Bitcoin, I believe there is a good chance he will make a statement, so I estimate this probability at 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The probability of both events occurring can be estimated using the multiplication of their individual probabilities, assuming some correlation. I will estimate this to be 0.60 * 0.70 = 0.42.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, it would be 0.60 + 0.70 - 0.42 = 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur and not P?)**: This is trickier since if Q occurs, it may imply that P also occurs, but there could be scenarios where he makes a statement without attending. I will estimate this at 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This is a conditional probability. If Musk shows up, he is likely to make a statement, so I will estimate this at 0.80.\n\nIn summary, the estimates are based on historical behavior, the nature of the events, and logical correlations between them.

Given his prominence in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate to high probability that he will attend.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate a high probability for P, then not_P will have a correspondingly lower probability.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P, and I expect it to have a similar probability since both inquire about his attendance.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of making public statements about Bitcoin, I estimate a moderate probability for this question as well. However, it is independent of his attendance.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability is likely lower than either P or Q individually because it requires both events to happen. I estimate it based on the likelihood of both scenarios occurring together.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it allows for either event happening. However, I have to be cautious not to exceed 1.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur and not P?)**: This scenario is interesting because it requires Musk to make a public statement without attending. I estimate this to be lower than Q alone since attendance could influence his willingness to speak.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability should reflect how likely Q is if P happens. If I believe that Musk's attendance increases the chance of him making a statement, this probability should be higher than Q alone.\n\nIn summary, I expect a complex interplay between these probabilities, particularly between P and Q, given their relationship.

The questions can be categorized into three main events: \n\n1. **P**: Whether Elon Musk shows up at the conference.\n2. **not_P**: Whether he does not show up at the conference.\n3. **Q**: Whether he makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference.\n\nGiven that these events are binary and mutually exclusive, the probabilities must add up to 1 for P and not_P. Therefore, if I assign a probability to P, not_P must be 1 - P. \n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n- **P** and **Q** are related but not dependent. Elon Musk can attend the conference without making a public statement, and he can also make a statement without attending. However, if he does attend, it might increase the likelihood of him making a statement, which leads to the **Q_given_P** question.\n- **P_and_Q** involves both events occurring together, which is a joint probability that must be calculated based on the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n- **P_or_Q** indicates that at least one of the events occurs, so its probability must be higher than either P or Q alone.\n- **Q_and_not_P** explores the scenario where he makes a statement but does not attend, which is again independent of P.\n\n### Probability Estimates:\n- For **P**, I would estimate a moderate probability based on Musk's general interest in Bitcoin and past attendance at similar events. \n- For **not_P**, it would be the complement of P.\n- For **Q**, I would assess the likelihood of Musk making a statement based on his recent engagement with Bitcoin topics. \n- The probabilities for **P_and_Q** and **P_or_Q** will be derived from the individual probabilities of P and Q, ensuring they respect the consistency rules outlined previously.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.50) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0035501910385588586, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.001183397012852953, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Factors influencing this include his popularity in the Bitcoin community and the nature of the event. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attendance)**: This is essentially the same as P, as it asks if he will attend. Therefore, it should have the same probability. \n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement)**: Given Musk's history of making statements about Bitcoin, even if he does not attend the conference, there is still a reasonable chance he might make a public statement during the event. This could be through social media or other channels. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both occur)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring is generally lower than either event happening independently, as it requires both conditions to be met. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the occurrence of at least one event. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Statement made without attendance)**: This situation can happen if Musk makes a statement without attending. Therefore, this probability should reflect scenarios where he engages with Bitcoin without being physically present at the conference.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Statement given attendance)**: If Musk shows up, the likelihood that he will make a statement increases, so this probability should be higher than Q alone.\n\nIn terms of consistency, I will ensure that the probabilities I assign to these events adhere to the rules given, particularly regarding complements, independence, and conditional probabilities. The relationships between these events will guide how I estimate their probabilities, ensuring that they align with the logical structure of the questions.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.70, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.60) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.80 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6b1a778b-0cb9-4935-91c5-f4ca0a59f755", "title": "Will Asa Hutchinson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Asa Hutchinson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his history of involvement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I estimate a moderate to high probability that he will attend, perhaps around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be around 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This should be aligned with P, thus also around 0.65. \n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Considering Musk's tendency to engage in public discourse about Bitcoin, I estimate this to be around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability would depend on both P and Q being true. If both have reasonably high probabilities, I estimate this to be lower than either P or Q, possibly around 0.45.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This would be higher than both P and Q individually, so I estimate it to be around 0.85, assuming a significant overlap between the two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while not P occurs?)**: This scenario represents a specific condition where Musk makes a statement but does not attend. Given that he has made statements without attending events in the past, I estimate this to be around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: The occurrence of Q is likely higher if P occurs, so I estimate this to be around 0.80.\n\nIn summary, I expect a strong relationship between P and Q, as Musk tends to make statements when he is present at significant events. The probabilities are interrelated, and I will ensure that they respect the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_6 consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.002854147902610349, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0009513826342034496, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07550665054113241, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This leads me to assign a probability of around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P and should equal 1 - P. Given my estimate for P, I calculate not_P to be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of commenting on Bitcoin, I estimate this probability to be 0.70, slightly higher than P because he might comment even if he doesn't attend.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both occur: Musk shows up and makes a statement about Bitcoin?)**: This probability would be lower than either P or Q, so I estimate it to be 0.50, reflecting that while both events are likely, they are not guaranteed to happen together.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either occur: Musk shows up or makes a statement?)**: This probability should be higher than both P and Q, so I estimate it to be 0.85, reflecting that at least one of these events is very likely to happen.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Musk make a statement but not show up?)**: This is a more complex estimate, as it requires Musk to comment without attending. I estimate this at 0.20, as it is plausible but less likely than the combined attendance and statement.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will he make a statement?)**: This probability would be higher if he attends, so I estimate it to be 0.80, reflecting the likelihood of him making a statement if he is present.\n\nIn summary, the estimates reflect a coherent view of the events, with probabilities assigned based on historical behavior and the nature of the events. I will need to ensure these probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\n{failed_check_cond consistency check failed!}\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "2675858d-1898-4d9e-9127-20dbfa6ec8f3", "title": "Will Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

I anticipate a similar probability here, possibly slightly adjusted based on the wording.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference)**: Given Musk's history of public statements about Bitcoin, I estimate a moderate probability that he will make such a statement, regardless of his attendance.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question requires both P and Q to be true. Thus, its probability is influenced by the intersection of the two events. I estimate it to be lower than either individual probability, as both need to occur.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone since it considers the occurrence of either event. I expect this to be a higher value than both P and Q. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This represents a scenario where Musk makes a public statement but does not attend. This is a specific combination, and I would estimate this probability based on the likelihood of Q occurring independently of P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. Given that Musk's attendance may influence his likelihood of making a statement, I would expect this probability to be higher than Q alone.\n\nThroughout this reasoning, I will ensure that my estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, ensuring that the relationships between the probabilities are mathematically sound. For example, the relationship between P and not_P must hold true, and the probabilities for P_and_Q and P_or_Q must be consistent with the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.40 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.55 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "e0f59c9a-b431-42b8-b173-526fb12aefed", "title": "Will either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Mike Pence or Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his previous engagements, I estimate this at a moderate level (e.g., 0.65).\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, estimated at 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is expected to be similar to P since it essentially asks the same question in a different format, so I estimate this also at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a separate event but could be influenced by whether he attends. I estimate this probability at a lower level (e.g., 0.50) since he might not make a statement even if he attends.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This requires both P and Q to be true. Given the independence of these events, I estimate this at a lower probability (e.g., 0.30).\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is the union of both events. I estimate this at a higher level, as it is likely at least one will happen (e.g., 0.80).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while not P?)**: This scenario is less likely since if he makes a public statement, it might be more likely he attends. I estimate this at a low probability (e.g., 0.10).\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**: If he attends, the likelihood of him making a statement increases.

I might estimate this at 0.75.\n\nP_and_Q, the probability that both P and Q occur, would be lower than the individual probabilities since both events are not guaranteed to happen together. I might estimate this at 0.50.\n\nP_or_Q, the probability that at least one of P or Q occurs, should be calculated based on the individual probabilities of P and Q and their joint probability. I would estimate this at around 0.85.\n\nFor Q_and_not_P, this would be the probability that he makes a statement but does not show up, which I would estimate at a lower probability, perhaps around 0.20.\n\nLastly, Q_given_P, the probability that he makes a statement given that he shows up, would likely be high, perhaps around 0.90, as his attendance would likely lead to a public statement.\n\nOverall, these estimates should respect the consistency rules, particularly concerning the relationships between the probabilities of P, not_P, Q, and their combinations.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.90\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.90 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.75,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "508eddd7-6cea-4444-b409-896f69f0edea", "title": "Will Larry Elder be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The probability of this happening depends on Musk's previous involvement in similar events and his interest in Bitcoin, which historically has been high. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P and should logically be 1 - P. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attendance)**: This is expected to be similar to P, as it essentially asks the same thing but in a slightly different phrasing. \n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: This is somewhat independent of P but can be influenced by it. If he attends, the likelihood of him making a statement increases. However, he could also make a statement without attending, so this probability needs to reflect that. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability should be lower than both P and Q since it requires both events to occur simultaneously. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the occurrence of at least one of the events. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs but P does not)**: This situation is plausible if Musk makes a statement without attending. The probability should be evaluated based on the likelihood of him making a statement independently of his attendance. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q given P)**: This conditional probability should reflect the increased likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. \n\nOverall, the relationships between these probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules, particularly the negation and conditional relationships. For instance, not_P must equal 1 - P, and P_and_Q must be less than or equal to both P and Q. \n\nI will set the probabilities based on these considerations and ensure they adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "8991b8b8-8762-45a2-adae-af71e21e43da", "title": "Will either Glenn Youngkin or Larry Elder be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Glenn Youngkin or Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

The questions revolve around whether he will show up, make a public statement about Bitcoin, or both. \n\n1. **P (Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This prediction is likely influenced by Musk's historical involvement in cryptocurrency discussions and events, suggesting a moderate probability of him attending. \n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P and should be directly related to the probability of P. If P is estimated at a certain value, then not_P should be 1 minus that value.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially similar to P, so it should have the same probability estimate.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is more independent as it does not necessarily depend on his attendance. However, given Musk's tendency to comment on Bitcoin, the probability may be moderate.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability is likely lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both events to happen simultaneously. The relationship between P and Q will influence this estimate.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This should be higher than both P and Q individually, as it captures the probability of at least one event happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur while not P occurs?)**: This is a more complex relationship, as it requires Q to happen while P does not. The estimate will depend on how likely Q is compared to the likelihood of P not happening.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability will likely be higher than the unconditional probability of Q, as his attendance may increase the likelihood of him making a public statement.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these questions are interconnected, with many of them being complements or conditional on each other. The estimates need to respect the consistency rules, ensuring that they align with mathematical relationships such as complements (neg), and the bounds set by the logical operations (and, or, etc.).\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.40 - 0.55 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.50 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, if he does show up, the likelihood of him making a statement increases significantly. I might estimate this probability at around 0.60.\n\n5. **P_and_Q** (Will both P and Q occur?): This would require both events to happen. If I estimate P at 0.65 and Q at 0.60, I would use the formula for the intersection of independent events, resulting in a probability of about 0.39.\n\n6. **P_or_Q** (Will either P or Q occur?): This probability would be calculated using the formula for the union of two events. Given the estimates for P and Q, I would expect this to be around 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P** (Will both Q and not_P occur?): This combination requires Q to happen while P does not.

Given these factors, I estimate this probability to be moderate to high.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P to be moderate to high, then not_P will be lower.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is similar to P, so I expect this to be in line with my estimate for P.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This probability may be influenced by his current stance on Bitcoin and whether he feels the need to address it publicly at the conference. Given his previous engagements and public statements, I would expect this probability to also be moderate.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring is likely lower than either P or Q alone, as it combines two events. Therefore, I will estimate this to be a product of the individual probabilities, adjusted for potential correlation.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the possibility of either event happening. I will estimate this accordingly.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This is a more specific scenario, which is likely to have a lower probability than P_and_Q, as it requires Q to happen while P does not.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability may be higher than the unconditional probability of Q, as Musk's attendance could increase the likelihood of him making a statement about Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, the events are interrelated, with P and Q being somewhat dependent on each other.

I estimate this at 0.45, reflecting a reasonable overlap between attendance and public statements. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: I estimate this at 0.85, as I believe it is quite likely that at least one of these events will happen. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This is a more nuanced event, and I estimate it at 0.20, reflecting the possibility of Musk making a statement without attending. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: I estimate this conditional probability at 0.80, as I believe that if Musk attends, he is likely to make a statement about Bitcoin. \n\nIn terms of consistency, I will ensure that the probabilities align with the rules provided. The independence and relationship between P and Q are particularly important here, as they influence the calculations for combined events.

However, since attendance is not guaranteed, I will assign a probability of around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, so I will estimate it as 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same question as P, so I will assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Given Musk's history of discussing Bitcoin publicly, I will estimate this probability to be slightly higher than attendance, around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both events to happen. I will estimate this as 0.42, assuming some correlation between attendance and making a statement.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability can be calculated using the formula for the union of two events, which can be estimated as P + Q - P_and_Q. I will estimate this as 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur and not P?)**: This situation is less likely, so I will estimate this at 0.10, recognizing that it's possible for Musk to make a statement without attending.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability is likely to be higher than the unconditional probability of Q due to the correlation between showing up and making a statement. I will estimate this at 0.80.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that these probabilities respect the consistency rules, particularly considering the relationships between P, Q, and their combinations.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.88 + 0.42 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.88 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.88 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, or consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "2e7bde58-f7e7-4fd4-917e-45459dbcb905", "title": "Will Glenn Youngkin be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Glenn Youngkin is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his previous engagement with the Bitcoin community, I would estimate this probability to be moderate, around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attendance)**: This question is essentially the same as P, so I would assign the same probability of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Public statement about Bitcoin)**: Musk has a history of making public statements about Bitcoin, especially during events. Thus, I would estimate this probability to be slightly higher, around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both show up and make a statement)**: The probability of both events occurring can be estimated by considering the independence of P and Q. If we assume a moderate positive correlation, I might estimate this probability at around 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either shows up or makes a statement)**: This can be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.70, then P_or_Q would be estimated at around 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Makes a statement but does not show up)**: This scenario is plausible, especially if he comments from afar.

Given his significant influence in the cryptocurrency community, I would estimate a relatively high probability that he will attend, say around 0.70.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is essentially the same as P, so I would assign it the same probability of 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Given Musk's tendency to comment on Bitcoin, even if he doesn't attend, I would assign a probability of around 0.60 to this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both occur: Musk shows up and makes a statement?)**: This is a conjunction of P and Q. Assuming some correlation between the two events (if he shows up, he is more likely to speak), I might estimate this at around 0.40.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either occur: Musk shows up or makes a statement?)**: This is the union of P and Q, which would be higher than either individual probability. Given our estimates, I would calculate this as P + Q - P_and_Q. If I estimate P at 0.70, Q at 0.60, and P_and_Q at 0.40, this gives us P_or_Q = 0.70 + 0.60 - 0.40 = 0.90.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both occur: Musk makes a statement and does not show up?)**: This is a more complex scenario. If he makes a statement but does not show up, I would estimate this probability to be lower, around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will he make a statement?)**: In this case, if we assume that showing up significantly increases the likelihood of making a statement, I might estimate this probability at around 0.80.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are intertwined, with attendance likely influencing the likelihood of public statements. I would ensure that the probabilities assigned adhere to the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.90 + 0.40 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.70, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.60) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.90 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.40 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.90,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

I would estimate a moderate probability, say around 0.60, considering the hype around Bitcoin and Musk's previous engagements.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P, so I would calculate it as 1 - P. Hence, if P is 0.60, not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would keep it at 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin on social media and in public forums, I would assign a higher probability, around 0.70, for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability would logically be lower than either P or Q alone but higher than their individual probabilities multiplied together due to potential correlation. I would estimate it around 0.45.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This would be calculated using the formula for the union of two probabilities. Given P and Q, I would expect this to be around 0.85, indicating a high likelihood that at least one of these events occurs.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P occurs)**: This is a more complex event, as it implies Musk makes a statement but does not show up. I would estimate this to be around 0.15, given the likelihood of him making a statement regardless of attendance.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given that P occurs)**: This conditional probability would be high, as Musk making a public statement is likely if he attends. I would estimate this at around 0.80.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are interconnected, with P and Q being positively correlated. The estimates will need to be adjusted to ensure they comply with the consistency rules laid out.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "3a55b444-61bf-4fcf-bddf-b72eb73ac4a3", "title": "Will Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

Given his previous engagements with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency communities, I estimate a moderate to high probability of attendance, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P** (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?): This is the complement of P and should logically be around 0.35, assuming the estimates for P and not_P are complementary and consistent.\n\n3. **para_P** (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?): This is essentially the same as P, so I would assign it the same probability, around 0.65.\n\n4. **Q** (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?): Given Musk's history of making public statements about Bitcoin, I would assign this a moderate probability, say around 0.55.\n\n5. **P_and_Q** (Will both P and Q occur?): This is a joint probability and should be less than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q. If I estimate that both events are somewhat correlated, I might assign it a probability of around 0.40.\n\n6. **P_or_Q** (Will either P or Q occur?): This probability must be greater than or equal to the individual probabilities and should be calculated accordingly. If P is 0.65 and Q is 0.55, I might estimate this around 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P** (Will both Q and not_P occur?): This event is a bit trickier, as it combines the occurrence of a statement without attendance. Given the context, I might estimate this around 0.15, suggesting that Musk could make a statement even if he doesn't attend.\n\n8. **Q_given_P** (Given P, will Q occur?): This conditional probability should be high if P is true. If I estimate that the likelihood of making a statement increases with attendance, I might set this around 0.70.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these events are interdependent, with P and Q influencing each other. I will ensure that the probabilities assigned adhere to the consistency rules outlined, such as ensuring that the probabilities for P and not_P sum to 1, and that the probabilities for P_and_Q and P_or_Q are consistent with their definitions.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.55 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_2, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "a4f1ddd6-0414-4176-85b1-c10a7b48ddcd", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President, or (b) Kamala Harris's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "(a) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?

Given his previous involvement with Bitcoin, I estimate this probability to be relatively high.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is high, not_P will be lower, reflecting the inverse relationship.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attendance)**: This is closely related to P, as it essentially asks the same question. Thus, I would expect this to have a similar probability to P.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: The likelihood of Musk making a public statement is also influenced by his previous engagement with Bitcoin, media presence, and the context of the conference. Given the prominence of the event, I would assign a moderate probability to this happening.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both attendance and statement)**: This would be a lower probability than either P or Q alone, as it requires both events to happen simultaneously. I would estimate this probability based on the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either attendance or statement)**: This probability should be higher than both P and Q individually, as it encompasses any scenario where either event occurs.

Given his past involvement with Bitcoin, I would estimate a moderate to high probability for this event, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P, so I will estimate it as 1 - P. This would be around 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference)**: Musk's engagement with Bitcoin makes it plausible that he might make a statement, but given that he might not attend, I would estimate this at around 0.50.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability would be the product of P and Q if we assume independence, but I might adjust this downward since both events are somewhat dependent. I would estimate this at around 0.30.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This would be the sum of P and Q minus P_and_Q. I would estimate this at around 0.70.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This is a bit tricky since if P does not happen, it might reduce the likelihood of Q. I would estimate this at around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: If Musk shows up, the likelihood of him making a statement might increase. I would estimate this at around 0.80.\n\nIn summary, I will assign probabilities based on the above reasoning while ensuring they adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.50) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6fd4477a-68e3-49d9-91ba-961e8ab04214", "title": "Will Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his significant influence in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate this probability to be moderately high but not certain, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. \n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is essentially the same as P, so it should also be around 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This probability is likely influenced by his previous statements and actions regarding Bitcoin. Given his active engagement with the cryptocurrency community, I estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability would depend on the joint occurrence of both events. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.70, and assuming some positive correlation, I might estimate this to be around 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, likely around 0.80, considering the likelihood of at least one of the events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not P occur?)**: This is a more complex event, as it requires Q to happen while P does not. If Q is 0.70 and not_P is 0.40, I might estimate this to be around 0.28, accounting for some dependency.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: If P occurs, the likelihood of Q should increase, so I might estimate this to be around 0.80.\n\nAfter considering these probabilities, I will check them against the consistency rules to ensure they align with the logical relationships defined.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.50 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nandor, or consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "ee641ec1-388e-411f-b547-09af876e0fa9", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Donald Trump be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, or (b) Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if either of the following conditions is met:\n\n(a) As of July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

The key events to consider are:\n\n1. **P**: Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024? This is a binary event that will resolve positively if he appears on stage.\n2. **not_P**: This is the negation of P, meaning it will resolve positively if he does not show up.\n3. **para_P**: This is essentially a rephrasing of P, asking if there is a chance he will attend. It should logically align with the probability of P.\n4. **Q**: Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference? This is independent of his attendance but could be influenced by it.\n5. **P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to occur, meaning Musk needs to attend and make a statement. The probability of this event should be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires the occurrence of both.\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event will resolve positively if either P or Q occurs. The probability should be higher than either P or Q individually but not exceeding 1.\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to occur while P does not. This means Musk makes a statement but does not attend, which could be a plausible scenario if he chooses to speak without being physically present.\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional event assesses the likelihood of Q occurring given that P has occurred. This probability should logically be high if P occurs, as attending might increase the likelihood of making a statement.\n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n- P and not_P are complementary events, meaning their probabilities should sum to 1.\n- P and Q may be independent, but the relationship can also be influenced by the context of the conference and Musk's interests in Bitcoin at that time. \n- The events P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P are dependent on the outcomes of P and Q, respectively.\n- The probabilities assigned should respect the consistency rules, ensuring that they do not contradict each other based on logical relationships.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.50) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Each question has a binary outcome, which allows us to apply the consistency rules effectively.\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk shows up)**: This probability reflects the likelihood of Musk being a guest at the conference. Given his prominence in the Bitcoin community, I estimate a relatively high probability.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P. If P is estimated at a certain level, not_P must be adjusted accordingly to maintain the relationship defined by the negation rule.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance he will attend)**: This is similar to P, but may have a slightly different interpretation. However, I will keep it aligned with P to ensure consistency.\n\n4. **Q (Public statement about Bitcoin)**: This reflects the likelihood of Musk making a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference. Given his history of engaging with the Bitcoin community, I estimate a moderate probability for this.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both occur)**: This probability combines the likelihood of both P and Q happening. It should be lower than either P or Q alone, reflecting the joint occurrence.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either occurs)**: This probability reflects the likelihood of at least one of the events occurring. It should be higher than both individual probabilities but cannot exceed 1.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Public statement without showing up)**: This reflects the likelihood of Musk making a statement while not attending the conference. This can happen if he engages with the audience remotely, which I will estimate based on the previous probabilities.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Public statement if he shows up)**: This conditional probability represents the likelihood of Musk making a statement given that he shows up.

I estimate this probability at around 0.60. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: Since this is the complement of P, it will be calculated as 1 - P, resulting in a probability of 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend)**: This is similar to P, so I will assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: Given his history and the nature of the event, I believe there is a reasonable chance he will make a statement, so I estimate this at 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: The probability of both events happening is generally lower than either event occurring alone. If I estimate P at 0.60 and Q at 0.70, I can calculate P_and_Q using the formula: P_and_Q = P * Q, which gives approximately 0.42.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This will be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Using the probabilities above, this results in around 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This is a more complex scenario. If we assume Q is likely (0.70) but P is not (0.40), I estimate this probability to be around 0.28.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: If P occurs, it might increase the likelihood of Q occurring as well, so I would estimate this at around 0.80.\n\nOverall, the questions are interrelated, especially P and Q, where the occurrence of one can influence the likelihood of the other.

The key questions involve whether he will show up, whether he will make a public statement about Bitcoin, and the implications of these events occurring together or separately.\n\n1. **P (Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a binary question that hinges on Elon Musk's attendance. Given his prominence in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate probability of around 0.60 for his attendance, considering factors like previous engagements and the significance of the event.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40, indicating a reasonable chance that he may not attend.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is similar to P, so I would assign it the same probability, 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: I would estimate this probability to be slightly higher, around 0.70, because even if he doesn't attend, he may still choose to make a statement given the media attention surrounding the event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: The joint occurrence of P and Q would be influenced by the probabilities of both events happening together. I would estimate this to be around 0.42, calculated as P * Q, considering they are somewhat independent but not perfectly so.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This would be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. I would estimate this to be around 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?)**: This scenario considers the possibility of him making a statement while not attending. This could be estimated at around 0.28, indicating a reasonable chance that he might still engage with the Bitcoin community even if he does not attend in person.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: Given that he shows up, I would expect a high likelihood that he will also make a statement, so I would estimate this at around 0.85.\n\nOverall, these estimates are interrelated, with P and Q being dependent on each other to some extent. The probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.88 + 0.42 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.88 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.88 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.85 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, or consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.002670692257312257, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.000890230752437419, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07304915670714032, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given the significance of the conference, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complementary event to P. If P has a probability of 0.60, then not_P would be 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would set this at 0.60 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: Given Musk's tendency to engage with Bitcoin publicly, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This is the joint probability of both events happening. Given that both events are somewhat independent, I would estimate this at P * Q = 0.60 * 0.70 = 0.42.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This is the probability of at least one of the events happening. Using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, I would calculate it as 0.60 + 0.70 - 0.42 = 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not_P occurs)**: For this, I would estimate a lower probability since it requires Q happening without P. Assuming there's a reasonable chance for Q to happen even if P does not, I might set this at around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: This is the conditional probability of Q given P. Since P and Q are somewhat correlated, I might estimate this at around 0.80, indicating a high likelihood that if Musk shows up, he will also make a statement.\n\nOverall, these estimates reflect the relationships between the events while adhering to the consistency rules. The estimates for P and Q are based on Elon Musk's known behavior and public persona in relation to Bitcoin.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.88 + 0.42 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.88 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.88 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "01e0b03e-bba2-43e2-a4b4-a02668606704", "title": "Will Nikki Haley be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Nikki Haley is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

If P is estimated at a certain value, not_P should reflect the remaining probability.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend)**: This is closely related to P, as it is essentially asking the same question but with a different phrasing. Therefore, I expect para_P to have a similar probability to P.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference)**: This probability is independent of P, as it is possible for Musk to make a statement without attending the event. However, it may be influenced by his general interest in Bitcoin and public engagement.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: The probability of both events happening simultaneously. Since these events are not mutually exclusive, I need to ensure that the probability reflects the joint occurrence without exceeding either individual probability.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This combines the probabilities of P and Q, ensuring that if both occur, it does not double count that scenario.

Given Musk's history with cryptocurrency and public appearances, I estimate a moderate probability for this event, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attending)**: This is closely related to P. Since it is essentially asking the same thing, I would estimate para_P at the same probability as P, which is 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Public statement about Bitcoin)**: Elon Musk has a history of making statements about Bitcoin, whether he is present at events or not. Therefore, I would estimate Q at a higher probability, around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This is the intersection of P and Q. Given that both events are somewhat dependent (his attendance may influence his statements), I would estimate P_and_Q to be lower than either P or Q, perhaps around 0.40.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one occurs)**: This probability can be calculated using the formula for the union of two events. Since both events are not mutually exclusive, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Public statement without attendance)**: This is a scenario where Musk makes a statement but does not attend. Given his history, I would estimate this at about 0.30, as he often comments on Bitcoin regardless of attendance.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Statement given attendance)**: If Musk attends, the likelihood of him making a statement increases significantly. Therefore, I would estimate this probability at a high value, perhaps around 0.90.\n\nNow, I will proceed to calculate the probabilities based on these estimates while ensuring that they comply with the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.90,\npara_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.40 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.40 / 0.90 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30,\nQ_given_P: 0.90,\npara_P: 0.60\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The questions are interconnected, where the occurrence of one event can influence the others, particularly between P (Elon Musk showing up) and Q (making a public statement about Bitcoin).\n\n1. **P (Elon Musk showing up)**: This is a specific event that may depend on various factors, such as his schedule and interest in the event. Given his past engagement with the cryptocurrency community, I would estimate a moderate probability of around 0.65 for him showing up.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, reflecting the likelihood of him not attending.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so it should also be around 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Public statement about Bitcoin)**: Elon Musk's engagement with Bitcoin is well-documented, and given the context of the conference, I would estimate a probability of around 0.70 that he will make a public statement.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both showing up and making a statement)**: This probability would be lower than both P and Q individually, as it represents the intersection of two events. I would estimate this around 0.45, assuming some correlation between showing up and making a statement.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either showing up or making a statement)**: This combines the probabilities of P and Q, accounting for overlap. Given the estimates, I would place this probability at approximately 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Making a statement but not showing up)**: This scenario is plausible, especially if he makes a statement via social media. I would estimate this at around 0.15.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Making a statement given he shows up)**: This would likely be higher than Q alone, as his presence at the conference increases the chance of a statement. I would estimate this at around 0.85.\n\nGiven these estimates, I will now check for consistency with the rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.85 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\n{failed_check_cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "7be4f03c-e31b-4e56-b17b-d041f4a10324", "title": "Will Biden drop out before July 20?", "body": "If Biden drops out or is otherwise unable to continue the race before July 20 midnight Eastern Time, this market will resolve to yes.

The events are interconnected, and their probabilities will reflect the likelihood of Musk showing up at the event, making a public statement about Bitcoin, and the implications of these actions on the related questions. \n\n1. **P (Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This event is likely influenced by Musk's public persona and his historical involvement in cryptocurrency discussions. I would estimate a moderate probability, say around 0.60, reflecting the uncertainty of his attendance.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is similar to P, and I would set it equal to P, so it would also be around 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This event is somewhat independent but could be influenced by his attendance. I might estimate this at 0.50, as he may choose to comment regardless of his physical presence.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This probability would be calculated as the product of P and Q, assuming independence. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.50, then P_and_Q would be 0.30.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This probability can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. With P at 0.60, Q at 0.50, and P_and_Q at 0.30, P_or_Q would be 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This situation would likely be less probable since if Musk makes a statement, it might be more likely that he is present. I would estimate this lower, perhaps at 0.15.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This is a conditional probability. If Musk shows up, the likelihood of him making a statement might increase, so I would set it higher, around 0.70.\n\nAfter estimating these probabilities, I will check each against the consistency rules provided. The relationships between the events (P, Q, and their combinations) must adhere to the specified mathematical constraints. If any inconsistencies arise, adjustments will be made to ensure that all rules are satisfied.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.30 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.50) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.70 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "502a96cd-b48a-41cf-bdf8-96b9e967cb27", "title": "Will either Kamala Harris be president by July 26 or Biden drop out by July 20?", "body": "This question resolves to \"Yes\" if either of the following occurs: (a) Vice President Kamala Harris is formally designated as President or Acting President of the United States at any point before July 26, 2024, 11:59 PM ET.

The main question, P, focuses on whether Musk will show up at the conference, while not_P assesses the opposite. The para_P question is essentially a rephrasing of P, which is expected to have a similar probability due to the overlapping nature of the events.\n\nThe question Q concerns Musk making a public statement about Bitcoin during the event, which could happen independently of his attendance. However, there may be some correlation between P and Q, as his presence might increase the likelihood of him making a statement. The P_and_Q question combines both events, so its probability should reflect the joint occurrence of both events.\n\nFor P_or_Q, the probability should be higher than either individual probability since it encompasses either event occurring. The Q_and_not_P question focuses on the scenario where Musk makes a statement but does not attend, which again could be independently assessed but would likely be lower than either event occurring alone.\n\nThe Q_given_P question looks at the probability of Musk making a statement given that he shows up, which should be higher than the standalone probability of making a statement, as his presence could influence that likelihood.\n\nIn terms of consistency rules:\n- The negation rule (not_P) should equal 1 - P.\n- The and/or rule must hold true where the joint probability (P_and_Q) reflects the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n- The and rule ensures that the joint probability does not exceed the minimum of the two individual probabilities.\n- The or rule ensures that the probability of at least one event occurring is bounded correctly.\n- The but rule assesses the relationship between the union and intersection of events.\n- The conditional probability rule (Q_given_P) should reflect the relationship between the two events.\n\nConsidering these aspects, I will estimate the probabilities based on the described relationships and the expected outcomes.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.50) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.50) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.50,\nP_and_Q: 0.32,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his prominence in the Bitcoin community, I would estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at a certain value, not_P would be 1 minus that value.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is essentially a rephrasing of P, so it should have the same probability as P.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin during the conference)**: This is influenced by his interest in Bitcoin and whether he feels compelled to address it publicly during the conference. Given his prior engagement with Bitcoin topics, I would estimate this probability as being reasonably significant but lower than P.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: The probability of both events happening is the intersection of the two events. This would likely be lower than either P or Q alone, as both need to occur simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which states it should be greater than or equal to the maximum of P and Q and less than or equal to the sum of P and Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not_P occurs)**: This is a more complex relationship, as it requires Q to happen while P does not. This probability would likely be low, as it suggests that Musk makes a statement without attending the event.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Probability of Q given P)**: This conditional probability would likely be high, as if Musk shows up, he may be more inclined to make a public statement about Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these probabilities need to adhere to the defined consistency rules. For instance, the relationship between P and not_P must satisfy the negation rule, and the intersection of events must adhere to the rules of conjunction and disjunction. I will ensure that the probability estimates reflect these relationships accurately.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.61\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.40 - 0.55 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.61 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.61\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "ac036195-6036-4101-b798-388334547826", "title": "Will Francis Suarez be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Francis Suarez is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his high profile and the potential media attention, I estimate this to be moderately likely, around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P, which equals 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is similar to P and should have a similar estimate, hence I set it at 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: Considering Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin on social media and public platforms, I estimate this probability to be higher, around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both occur: Musk shows up and makes a statement?)**: This is the joint probability of P and Q. Given the correlation between attending and making a statement, I estimate this to be 0.50.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either occur: Musk shows up or makes a statement?)**: This is calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Substituting the values gives me 0.60 + 0.70 - 0.50 = 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Musk make a statement and not show up?)**: This scenario is less likely since making a statement without attending is less common for high-profile figures. I estimate this to be around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will he make a statement?)**: If Musk shows up, the likelihood of him making a statement increases significantly. I estimate this probability to be around 0.90.\n\nBy ensuring these probabilities are consistent with each other and adhere to the rules provided, I can maintain a logical framework for my estimates.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.90\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.50 / 0.90 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.50,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.56\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "32789bcb-b559-4e80-ab04-95819f978a7b", "title": "Will either Donald Trump or Francis Suarez be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Donald Trump or Francis Suarez is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his past engagements, I would estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, say around 0.65. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance he will attend)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would estimate this also at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: This question is somewhat independent of P, as he can make a statement whether or not he attends. Given his interest in Bitcoin, I might estimate this at 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both occur)**: This is a conjunction of P and Q. Assuming P and Q are somewhat independent, I would estimate this as P * Q, which would be 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either occurs)**: This is calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q. So, it would be 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Public statement and does not show up)**: This situation involves Q occurring while not P occurs. Assuming some independence, I would estimate this as Q * not_P, which would be 0.70 * 0.35 = 0.245.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q given P)**: This is a conditional probability. If he shows up, I would estimate that the likelihood of him making a statement increases, perhaps to 0.85. \n\nIn summary, I would summarize the relationships as follows: P and not_P are complements, Q is independent from P, P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P are derived from their respective probabilities, and Q_given_P reflects the increased likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. \n\nOverall, these estimates will be aligned with the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.46,\nP_or_Q: 0.89,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.89 + 0.46 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.89 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.89 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 0.85 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nandor, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.85\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his past involvement with Bitcoin and the significance of the event, I estimate a moderate to high probability for this event occurring (e.g., 0.65).\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance Musk will attend)**: This is essentially the same as P, so it should be equal (0.65).\n\n4. **Q (Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: This event may occur independently of his attendance. Given his history of discussing Bitcoin publicly, I estimate this probability at around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This is the joint probability of both events happening. Given that both events are likely, I estimate this at around 0.45, reflecting a reasonable overlap between the two events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one of P or Q occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either individual probability. Given that P is 0.65 and Q is 0.70, I estimate P_or_Q at around 0.85, as it's likely that at least one of the events will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs but not P)**: This probability is likely lower since if Musk makes a public statement, it may be more likely that he is present.

However, since attendance at conferences can be unpredictable, I estimate this probability around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is the complement of P, and since the probability of P is estimated at 0.65, not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public statement about Bitcoin)**: Given Musk's tendency to make public statements about Bitcoin, I estimate this probability at 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q happen)**: The probability of both events occurring would be lower than either occurring individually. I estimate this at 0.45, considering some overlap but also the chance that he could attend without making a statement.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q happens)**: This probability should be higher than either individual event but less than 1. I estimate it at 0.85, as there is a good chance at least one will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q happens while not P)**: This is a scenario where Musk makes a statement but does not attend. I estimate this at 0.25, acknowledging that while possible, it is less likely than both attending and speaking.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P happens, will Q happen)**: This conditional probability should be higher than the base probability of Q since attendance may encourage a statement. I estimate this at 0.80.\n\nNow, I will check these probabilities against the consistency rules to ensure they align properly. Each probability must adhere to the mathematical relationships defined in the consistency rules, ensuring that they are logically coherent and do not contradict one another.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.80 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.85,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "ad04028c-b31a-4129-af49-c1f075f8f518", "title": "Will either Donald Trump Jr. or Nikki Haley be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Donald Trump Jr. or Nikki Haley is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given his previous engagements and public interest in Bitcoin, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P, so it should be 1 - P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is similar to P, so I would expect it to have a similar probability, around 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public statement about Bitcoin during the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This event is somewhat independent of P but still related, as his attendance may influence whether he makes a statement. I might assign a probability of 0.55, considering he may choose to address Bitcoin regardless of his attendance.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This is a conjunction of P and Q. To estimate this, I would consider the probabilities of both events occurring together. If I assume P and Q are positively correlated, I might estimate this at around 0.40.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This represents the union of P and Q. Using the formula for the union of two probabilities, I would estimate this around 0.70, considering both events have a reasonable chance of occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P?)**: This is a more complex event that requires both a public statement and Musk's absence. I might estimate this at around 0.15, as it would depend on the specific circumstances.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This is a conditional probability, and I would estimate this at around 0.75, as his attendance may increase the likelihood of him making a public statement.\n\nThe relationships between these events are important. P and Q are somewhat independent but can influence each other. The consistency rules will help ensure that the probabilities I assign do not contradict one another.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.40 - 0.55 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.55) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.55,\nP_and_Q: 0.38,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
