To resolve this, we need to look at recent legislative actions in South Carolina regarding abortion.\n\n    1. **Recent Legislative Actions**: \n    - **Bill 474** and **Bill 240** are relevant to this question. Both bills aim to restrict abortion in South Carolina but do not represent a total ban without exceptions.\n    - **Bill 474** focuses on banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, with exceptions for medical emergencies, rape, incest, or fatal fetal anomalies.\n    - **Bill 240** proposes a ban on abortions but includes exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to the mother's life.\n\n    2. **Recent Developments**:\n    - A near-total abortion ban was defeated in South Carolina with the help of three Republican women senators, indicating that a total ban may not have sufficient support to pass.\n    - The South Carolina legislature approved a 6-week abortion ban, which includes exceptions for rape and incest, on May 24, 2023, and it was signed into law by Governor Henry McMaster on May 25, 2023.\n\n    3. **Conclusion**:\n    - Given the recent legislative actions and the defeat of a near-total abortion ban, it is unlikely that the South Carolina Senate will pass a total abortion ban by July 31, 2024.\n    - The approved 6-week abortion ban with exceptions does not meet the criteria for a 'total abortion ban' as defined in the question.\n\n    Since the question specifically asks about a total abortion ban and no such legislation has been passed as of the current date (September 21, 2024), and given the recent legislative trends, we can confidently resolve this question.", "can_resolve_question": true, "answer": false, "agreement": true}}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.3117246378651079, "elicitation_metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.3236956066164981, "elicitation_metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.3483314773547883, "elicitation_metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.4, "elicitation_metadata": null}, {"name": "ParaphraseChecker", "data": {"para_P": {"id": "6423e81c-2ec4-4a0c-aefe-a0407c438483", "title": "Is it possible for the South Carolina Senate to approve a complete ban on abortions by July 2024?", "body": "This inquiry will be answered with a YES if, by July 31, 2024, the South Carolina Senate successfully enacts a law that implements a complete ban on abortions.

For instance, the Commander of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) Admiral Fahd Al-Ghufaili visited Paris and met with the Chief of Staff of the French Navy Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, discussing various defense projects and technologies, including submarines. Additionally, Saudi Arabia and France signed an executive plan for cooperation on capabilities, military industries, and R&D, indicating a deepening of their defense ties. 2. **Economic and Energy Cooperation**: France has been engaging in talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to diversify Europe's energy supplies, aiming to reduce dependence on Russian energy sources. This indicates a new area of cooperation focused on energy security. 3. **Industrial and Technological Collaboration**: The participation of Saudi Arabia in the Eurosatory 2024 defense exhibition in Paris, where the Saudi pavilion showcased the kingdom's military industries and invited global investors, highlights efforts to enhance industrial and technological collaboration between the two countries. Given these developments, it is clear that France and Saudi Arabia have indeed implemented new forms of cooperation, particularly in defense and energy sectors, by July 2024.

For instance, Montgomery County has higher rates starting July 1, 2024 ($17.15 for 51+ employees, $15.50 for 11-50 employees, and $15 for 10 or fewer employees), and Howard County will increase its rate to $16 for 15 or more employees on January 1, 2025.\n    \n    3. **Relevance to Fast Food Workers**: The question specifically asks about fast food workers, but the state minimum wage applies to all employees, including those in fast food restaurants. There is no indication that fast food workers are exempt from the state minimum wage rate.\n    \n    4. **Stability of the Minimum Wage**: There is no information suggesting that the minimum wage in Maryland will be reduced below $15 per hour for fast food workers by July 31, 2024.

Additionally, it introduced e-vouchers for loans up to Rs 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions, with an annual interest subvention of 3% of the loan amount.\n    \n    2. **Education Loan Schemes**: The government has various education loan schemes, including those offering interest subsidies and flexible repayment terms. However, these schemes primarily focus on providing financial assistance rather than specifically lowering monthly payments.\n    \n    3. **Tax Relief**: The Income-tax Act, 1961, provides tax relief under Section 80E for the interest portion of EMIs paid on education loans. This can indirectly help in managing loan repayments but does not constitute a direct plan to lower monthly payments.\n    \n    Given the information available up to July 31, 2024:\n    - The Budget 2024 announcements and existing education loan schemes aim to provide financial assistance and subsidies but do not specifically target lowering monthly payments for student loan borrowers.\n    - There is no evidence of a new initiative implemented by July 31, 2024, that directly aims to reduce monthly payments for a significant number of student loan borrowers.\n    \n    Therefore, based on the current information, the question cannot be resolved affirmatively.
