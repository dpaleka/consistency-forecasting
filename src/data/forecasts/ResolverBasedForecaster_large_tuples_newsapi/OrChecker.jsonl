As of the latest information, parts of the SAVE plan have been blocked by court injunctions.\n    - However, there are other relief programs and payment pauses that have been implemented. For instance, the payment pause due to COVID-19 and subsequent relief programs like \"Fresh Start\" and the \"on-ramp\" program have been in place to help borrowers.\n    - Despite these programs, it is crucial to note that any new plan to defer payments must not be blocked by legal challenges to meet the criteria.

Key Points from the Sources: Multiple Announcements and Plans: A fleet-scale nuclear development company in Kentucky announced plans to construct a series of nuclear power plants, which indicates a significant expansion beyond just two reactors. TerraPower submitted a construction permit for its Natrium small modular reactor (SMR) in Wyoming and began nonnuclear construction work, which is part of a broader trend of advanced nuclear development but does not specifically come from a government source. The Biden administration and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have announced several initiatives to support the development and deployment of advanced nuclear reactors, including SMRs and microreactors. These include federal funding and regulatory support, but these are not necessarily new reactor construction plans announced by the government beyond the existing ones. Federal Support and Legislation: The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 and other federal actions provide significant support for advanced nuclear technologies, including funding for new reactor designs and demonstration projects. However, these actions themselves do not constitute a direct government announcement of new reactor construction plans. State-Level Developments: Dominion Energy Virginia announced plans for a small modular nuclear reactor at North Anna Power Station, but this is a utility company's initiative rather than a direct government announcement. Conclusion: While there are numerous developments and announcements related to nuclear energy expansion, the key criterion is an official government announcement of plans to build additional nuclear reactors beyond the two currently planned.
