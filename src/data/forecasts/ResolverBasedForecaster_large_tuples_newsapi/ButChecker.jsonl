For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a payment pause that was extended multiple times until October 2023.\n    - The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, which includes provisions for reduced monthly payments and potential forgiveness, has been partially implemented but is currently facing legal challenges. Specifically, parts of the SAVE plan were blocked by court injunctions, but some aspects of the plan were already in effect as of July 2024.\n    - Additionally, the Department of Education has temporary relief programs such as the \"on ramp\" and Fresh Start, which help borrowers resume payments and avoid negative credit reporting. These programs indicate ongoing efforts to defer or adjust student loan payments.\n\n    Given this information, it is clear that the U.S. Education Department has implemented plans to defer or adjust student loan payments, even if some parts are under legal challenge.\n\n    ### New Jersey Referendum on Abortion Rights\n    - There is no information provided in the sources about New Jersey conducting a statewide referendum on enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution by July 2024. Without official announcements or reports from major news outlets, we cannot confirm the occurrence of such a referendum.\n\n    ### Conclusion\n    Since the U.S. Education Department has indeed implemented plans to defer student loan payments (despite some legal challenges), the question can be resolved positively based on this part alone.", "answer": true}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 4.999299852576735, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 1.6664332841922451, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 15.76986894602904, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
