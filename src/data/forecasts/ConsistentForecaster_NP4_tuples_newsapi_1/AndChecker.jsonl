The result must be validated by official city announcements or reported by at least two credible news outlets (such as Associated Press, Reuters, or local Alaskan news organizations). If such a vote does not occur, or if it takes place but does not result in approval of the weekday-only limitation, this aspect of the question will be answered as NO. Note that this aspect pertains to the vote itself, not the enforcement of the limitation. (b) There are credible reports from at least two major international news organizations (such as Reuters, Associated Press, BBC, or Al Jazeera) regarding large protests in Canada specifically in reaction to the government's alterations in environmental policies.
