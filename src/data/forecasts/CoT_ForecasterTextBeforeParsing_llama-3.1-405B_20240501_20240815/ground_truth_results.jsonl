Tucker Carlson's Current Position and Influence: Tucker Carlson is a well-known and influential figure within the conservative media landscape, hosting one of the most-watched shows on Fox News. His opinions and commentary often set the agenda for conservative discussions and have the potential to influence a significant portion of the Republican base. However, being a media personality and having political influence do not directly translate to political candidacy or the ability to secure a nomination. 2. Political Experience and Candidacy Indicators: As of my last update, Tucker Carlson has not announced any intention to run for the presidency in 2024. While he has been involved in political commentary for many years, he lacks direct political experience, such as holding elected office, which is often (though not always) a significant factor in successful presidential candidacies. 3. Republican Party Dynamics and Field of Candidates: The Republican Party has a broad field of potential candidates for the 2024 election, including individuals with significant political experience, fundraising capabilities, and national recognition. The competition for the nomination is expected to be intense, with several candidates already positioning themselves for a run. 4. Historical Precedents: While not unheard of, it is relatively rare for individuals without prior political or military experience to secure a major party's presidential nomination. Donald Trump's successful candidacy in 2016 is a notable exception, but this was under a unique set of circumstances and does not necessarily set a new standard for future nominations. 5. Delegate Selection Process: The Republican National Convention's delegate selection process is complex and varies by state. Securing the nomination requires a candidate to appeal broadly across different states and demographics within the party. This process often favors candidates with strong organizational support and the ability to perform well in a variety of electoral settings. Considering these factors, while Tucker Carlson has significant influence within conservative media and could potentially have a strong appeal to parts of the Republican base, the lack of direct political experience, the absence of a declared candidacy, and the competitive nature of the Republican field make it unlikely that he would be selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election."}, "prob": 0.05}, "prob": 0.05, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.074, "brier_score": 0.0025, "brier_score_scaled": 99.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.0938, "brier_score": 0.0088, "brier_score_scaled": 96.5, "log_score": 0.1421}}

Opposition Parties' Strength: The main opposition party, the Indian National Congress (INC), has been struggling to regain its footing after a series of electoral setbacks. Other regional parties have shown strength in their respective states but forming a cohesive national alliance to challenge the BJP has been a challenge for them. 4. Economic and Social Factors: Economic growth, job creation, and social issues will play crucial roles in the next election. The incumbent government's handling of these issues will influence voter sentiment. 5. Electoral Strategies and Campaigns: The BJP has been known for its robust electoral machinery and effective campaign strategies. This has given them an edge in translating their popularity into electoral victories. 6. Regional Dynamics: Regional parties and alliances could play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election, especially in states where the BJP is not traditionally strong. The BJP's ability to form alliances and its performance in key states will be critical.

International Political Climate: The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has led to significant international sanctions against Russia. Many international sporting organizations have also imposed restrictions on Russian participation. Given this context, there's a strong possibility that similar restrictions could be applied to the 2024 Olympics. 2. IOC Stance: The IOC has previously allowed Russian athletes to compete under the Olympic flag or as part of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, due to doping sanctions imposed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). However, the current geopolitical situation might lead the IOC to reconsider or modify its stance on Russian participation. 3. Precedents: In the past, countries have been barred from competing in the Olympics due to various reasons, including political boycotts and doping scandals. The most relevant precedent for this scenario is perhaps the participation of Russian athletes under the ROC flag in the 2020 Olympics, which was a compromise solution to the doping ban. 4. Specific Conditions for Resolution: The question specifies that no more than 34 Russian athletes can compete for the resolution to be 'Yes'. This low threshold suggests that even a minimal representation of Russian athletes could lead to a 'No' resolution, unless there is a near-total ban. Given these considerations: - The international community's stance against Russia due to the ongoing conflict suggests a strong possibility of restrictions. - The IOC's previous handling of Russian doping sanctions indicates a willingness to impose restrictions but also to find compromise solutions. - The specific condition that no more than 34 Russian athletes can compete sets a very low bar for participation. Therefore, considering the geopolitical tensions and the precedents, but also the IOC's tendency to seek compromise and the very specific condition for resolution, the probability of Russian athletes being barred from competing at the 2024 Olympics to the extent that no more than 34 are allowed to participate seems relatively high but not certain."}, "prob": 0.7}, "prob": 0.7, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.5146, "brier_score": 0.09, "brier_score_scaled": 64.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.4329, "brier_score": 0.3216, "brier_score_scaled": -28.6, "log_score": 1.2079}}

These regulations could potentially restrict or impose conditions on the availability of services like ChatGPT. However, OpenAI might adapt to these requirements to ensure compliance. 2. Availability History: ChatGPT has already shown instances of limited availability in certain regions due to regulatory or other concerns. For example, its temporary unavailability in Italy in early 2023. This indicates that while there might be instances of restriction, the overall trend could lean towards broader availability with some exceptions. 3. OpenAI's Expansion Plans: The company has been expanding the availability of ChatGPT to more regions, indicating a desire to make the service widely available. However, this expansion is contingent on compliance with local regulations and addressing ethical concerns. 4. Technical and Ethical Considerations: The definition of 'generally available' allows for some limitations, such as age restrictions or unavailability in certain countries, as long as more than 50% of the EU population can access it.

Current Political Landscape: As of my last update in 2023, the Republican field for the 2024 presidential election is wide open, with several potential candidates expressing interest or already having announced their candidacy. The landscape is subject to change based on various factors, including candidate popularity, fundraising capabilities, and the outcomes of primary elections. 2. Will Hurd's Background and Appeal: Will Hurd is a former CIA officer and has served in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Texas's 23rd congressional district. His background in national security and his experience in a swing district could appeal to a broad range of Republican voters. However, his relatively moderate stance on some issues might also make it challenging for him to win over the more conservative factions within the party. 3. Competition and Republican Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has shown a tendency in recent years to nominate candidates who are strongly aligned with the party's conservative wing. If Hurd faces competition from candidates who are perceived as more conservative or who have stronger ties to the party's base, this could hinder his chances of securing the nomination. 4. Visibility and Fundraising: Successful presidential candidates typically need to have high visibility and the ability to raise substantial funds. While Hurd has a compelling personal story and political experience, his ability to raise funds and maintain a high level of visibility in a crowded field will be crucial. 5. Primary Election Process: The Republican nomination process involves a series of primary elections and caucuses across the country, culminating in the Republican National Convention. The outcome of these primaries, especially in key states, will significantly influence Hurd's chances. Given these considerations, while Will Hurd has a strong background and could appeal to a broad range of voters, the challenges of standing out in a potentially crowded field, appealing to the conservative base of the Republican Party, and overcoming the fundraising and visibility hurdles make his path to the nomination challenging."}, "prob": 0.05}, "prob": 0.05, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.074, "brier_score": 0.0025, "brier_score_scaled": 99.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.0938, "brier_score": 0.0088, "brier_score_scaled": 96.5, "log_score": 0.1421}}

Anthropic's Focus on Safety: Anthropic is known for its emphasis on AI safety. This suggests that they are likely to engage in and publish research related to the safety of their models, including external red-teaming efforts. 2. Red-teaming in AI Safety: Red-teaming is a critical process in AI safety where external or internal teams attempt to find vulnerabilities or flaws in AI models. Given the increasing importance of AI safety and the growing scrutiny of AI models, it's plausible that Anthropic would prioritize such efforts. 3. External Red-teaming: The question specifies external red-teaming. This implies that the assessment must come from outside Anthropic, which adds a layer of independence and credibility to the safety assessment. External red-teaming can be more complex to organize and publish due to potential confidentiality and intellectual property concerns, but it's an essential step for rigorous safety validation. 4. Publication of Results: The publication of results from such an effort would depend on several factors, including the findings themselves, the strategic decisions of Anthropic regarding transparency, and the potential impact on their business and the broader AI safety discourse. 5. Timeline: The question sets a specific deadline of June 30, 2024. Given the time frame, it's reasonable to assume that if Anthropic is planning to engage in such activities, they would likely have enough time to organize, conduct, and publish the results of external red-teaming efforts. Considering these points, Anthropic's commitment to AI safety, the importance of external validation of AI models, and the specified timeline, it's reasonable to infer a moderate to high likelihood of Anthropic publishing a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024."}, "prob": 0.75}, "prob": 0.75, "resolution": false, "log_score": 2.0, "brier_score": 0.5625, "brier_score_scaled": -125.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.4458, "brier_score": 0.1987, "brier_score_scaled": 20.5, "log_score": 0.8514}}

Google DeepMind's Commitment to Safety: Google DeepMind, now a part of Alphabet Inc., has demonstrated a commitment to the ethical development and deployment of AI. They have published numerous papers and reports on the safety and ethics of AI, indicating a willingness to engage with the broader research community on these issues. 2. Red-Teaming in AI Development: Red-teaming, the practice of simulating attacks or critical evaluations by an external party to test the robustness and safety of a system, is increasingly recognized as a valuable tool in AI development. Given the growing awareness of AI safety issues, it's plausible that Google DeepMind would engage in such practices to enhance the credibility and safety of their models. 3. Public Disclosure and Transparency: Google DeepMind has a history of publishing research and findings related to AI safety and ethics. This suggests a culture of transparency that would support the public disclosure of red-teaming results, especially if such disclosure contributes to the broader understanding and improvement of AI safety. 4. Timeline and Feasibility: Given the question's timeline, ending on June 30, 2024, we must consider whether it's feasible for Google DeepMind to organize, conduct, and publish the results of external red-teaming within this timeframe. Given the complexity of organizing such efforts and the time required for thorough evaluation and publication, this might be a challenging but not impossible task. 5. External Pressure and Regulatory Environment: The increasing scrutiny of AI systems by regulatory bodies, media, and the public might incentivize Google DeepMind to proactively demonstrate their commitment to safety through external red-teaming. This could further motivate them to publish such reports to maintain public trust and comply with emerging regulatory requirements. Considering these factors, while there are no guarantees, the culture of transparency and safety at Google DeepMind, combined with the growing importance of red-teaming in AI safety, suggests that it is more likely than not that they will publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024."}, "prob": 0.65}, "prob": 0.65, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.5146, "brier_score": 0.4225, "brier_score_scaled": -69.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.4192, "brier_score": 0.1757, "brier_score_scaled": 29.7, "log_score": 0.7839}}

OpenAI's commitment to safety: OpenAI has consistently emphasized the importance of safety in AI development. They have shown a willingness to engage with external experts and researchers to improve the safety of their models. This suggests a positive inclination towards transparency and external scrutiny. 2. Precedents for external red-teaming: There have been instances where AI companies, including OpenAI, have engaged in some form of external review or red-teaming for their models. This indicates a growing recognition of the value of external perspectives in identifying and mitigating potential safety risks. 3. The growing importance of AI safety: As AI models become increasingly powerful and integrated into various aspects of life, the importance of ensuring their safety grows. This could motivate OpenAI to demonstrate a proactive approach to safety through external red-teaming and transparent reporting. 4. Challenges and limitations: External red-teaming requires coordination with external parties, which can be time-consuming and may involve navigating complex logistical and legal considerations. Additionally, there might be concerns about intellectual property protection and the potential reputational risks associated with publicly disclosing vulnerabilities. 5. Timeline: The question specifies a deadline of June 30, 2024. Given the complexity of organizing and conducting external red-teaming, as well as preparing a comprehensive report, the timeline might be challenging but not impossible, especially if efforts are already underway.

This victory raised his national profile and demonstrated his ability to win in a competitive, swing state. However, his national recognition and appeal within the broader Republican Party, especially compared to other potential candidates, remain limited. 2. Competitive Landscape: The field of potential Republican nominees for the 2024 presidential election could be quite crowded, including figures with higher national profiles and broader bases of support within the party. These may include former President Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence, governors like Ron DeSantis of Florida, and other senators and representatives with national followings. Youngkin would need to significantly raise his profile and appeal to compete effectively against such candidates. 3. Historical Context: Historically, Republican nominees often have national recognition, broad support within the party, and significant political experience at the federal level. While there are exceptions, candidates typically build their case for nomination over several years through national appearances, legislative initiatives, and party leadership roles. Youngkin's relatively recent rise to prominence and limited national exposure compared to other contenders make his path to the nomination more challenging.

The Miami Heat has a history of success, including NBA championships. Their recent performances, particularly in the 2022-2023 season, showed resilience and competitiveness, even without being the top-ranked team in the league. The Heat has maintained a core group of players, including Jimmy Butler, who has been instrumental in their success. The continuity and chemistry among the players are significant factors in their favor. However, the overall strength and depth of their roster compared to other top teams need to be considered. The impact of injuries on key players can drastically change a team's fortunes. As of the last update, if the Heat are going into the 2024 season with their key players healthy, this would be a positive sign. Erik Spoelstra is one of the top coaches in the league, known for his ability to adapt and get the most out of his players. Good coaching can elevate a team's chances, especially in the playoffs. The NBA is highly competitive, with several teams capable of winning the championship. The strength of teams in both the Eastern and Western Conferences, including any offseason moves that significantly strengthen contenders, needs to be assessed. Given these considerations, while the Miami Heat is a strong team with the potential to win the championship, the competition in the NBA is fierce, and several teams have the talent and depth to win it all. Without specific details on offseason changes, injuries, or significant shifts in team dynamics as of my last update, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact probability.

However, predicting these factors is challenging and subject to a high degree of uncertainty. 5.

However, consistency has been an issue, and they often struggle against the league's elite. Considering these factors, while the Pacers have the potential to be a competitive team, they are not among the top contenders for the NBA championship as of the 2023-2024 season.

Current Performance: As of my last update in 2023, Borussia Dortmund has been performing well in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League. They have a strong squad with talented players like Jude Bellingham, S\u00e9bastien Haller, and Julian Brandt. Their performance in the current season's Champions League group stages and their position in the Bundesliga will give an initial indication of their potential. 2. Historical Success: Borussia Dortmund won the Champions League in 1997 and has since appeared in the final once more, in 2013, where they lost to Bayern Munich. While historical success can provide some context, it's less indicative of future performance compared to more recent achievements and the current team composition. 3. Strength of the Competition: The UEFA Champions League is one of the most competitive club football competitions in the world. Teams like Manchester City, Liverpool, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich consistently show strong performances. The competition's knockout stage often brings surprises, but these top teams generally have a higher chance of advancing to the later stages. 4. Notable Changes: Any significant changes in the team's lineup, coaching staff, or injuries to key players can impact their chances. For instance, losing a top scorer or a defensive stalwart could weaken their overall performance. Given these factors, while Borussia Dortmund is a strong team with the potential to go deep into the competition, the Champions League is highly competitive, and several teams could realistically win it. Dortmund's chances are somewhat lower than those of the very top contenders like Manchester City or Real Madrid, who have consistently shown a higher level of performance in recent years.

However, political voting can also affect their chances, as Armenia often faces challenges in receiving points from certain neighboring countries due to regional tensions.

A favorable draw, such as performing late in the show, can increase a country's chances of qualifying. Additionally, we need to consider the voting system used in Eurovision.

Greece has a relatively good track record in Eurovision, having qualified for the Grand Final in most years since the introduction of the semi-final system in 2004. They have also won the contest once, in 2005, with the song 'My Number One' by Helena Paparizou. In recent years, however, Greece's results have been more mixed, with some entries failing to qualify for the Grand Final. Without knowing the specific details of Greece's entry for Eurovision 2024, such as the song and artist, it's difficult to make a precise prediction. However, based on Greece's overall history in the contest and the fact that they usually manage to qualify for the Grand Final, we can make an educated estimate. Assuming that Greece will participate in a semi-final and that their entry will be of average quality compared to their previous entries, the probability of them qualifying for the Grand Final can be estimated as follows: Past performance: 70% (Greece has qualified for the Grand Final in 70% of the years since 2004), Entry quality: 50% (assuming an average-quality entry), Competition: 40% (the competition in Eurovision is always strong, but some years are more competitive than others).

Lithuania has been participating in Eurovision since 1994 and has had mixed results. However, in recent years, Lithuania has shown an improvement in its performances. For instance, in 2022, the country's representative, Monika Liu with the song 'Sentimentai,' qualified for the Grand Final and finished in 14th place. This recent success could indicate a positive trend for Lithuania's participation in the contest. Another factor to consider is the voting system and the alliances within the contest. Eurovision voting is known for its geopolitical and cultural biases, with countries often voting for their neighbors or countries with which they share cultural or historical ties. Lithuania, being a Baltic country, might benefit from votes from neighboring countries or those within the same cultural sphere. However, predicting Eurovision outcomes is inherently uncertain due to the subjective nature of music preferences and the unpredictability of live performances. A country's qualification can be significantly influenced by the quality of the performance on the night of the semi-final, the staging, and how well the song resonates with the audience and jurors. Given these considerations, while there's a positive trend in Lithuania's recent performances and potential support from regional voting, the overall outcome remains highly uncertain. Therefore, without specific information about the 2024 entry, performance, and competition, a cautious approach is to lean slightly towards the possibility of qualification based on recent trends but to remain largely neutral due to the inherent unpredictability of the contest."}, "prob": 0.55}, "prob": 0.55, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.8625, "brier_score": 0.2025, "brier_score_scaled": 19.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.3888, "brier_score": 0.3736, "brier_score_scaled": -49.4, "log_score": 1.3631}}

This mixed record suggests that while Serbia has the capability to produce competitive entries, their qualification is not guaranteed. Second, consider the competition format. The Eurovision semi-finals feature a significant number of countries vying for a limited number of spots in the Grand Final. The qualification process is highly competitive, and even strong entries can fail to qualify due to the voting dynamics. Third, consider the importance of the song and performance. A country's qualification largely depends on the quality of their song and the performance on the night of the semi-final. Factors such as the singer's vocal ability, the song's composition, and the overall stage performance play a crucial role. Lastly, consider the subjective nature of the contest. Eurovision voting is highly subjective, with countries often voting based on regional alliances, cultural affinity, and personal taste.

However, past performance is not a guarantee of future success, and each year's contest is highly competitive. Another factor to consider is the impact of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which may influence voting patterns. Some countries may vote for Ukraine as a show of support, while others may avoid voting for Ukraine due to political tensions. Additionally, the contest's voting system, which combines jury and public votes, can lead to unpredictable outcomes. The jury vote often favors songs with strong musical and artistic merit, while the public vote can be more influenced by factors like stage presence and emotional appeal. Given these factors, it's difficult to make a precise prediction, but we can look at Ukraine's recent performances and general trends.

Member states generally respect and follow WHO's guidelines and recommendations, which could positively influence the voting outcome. 4. Potential Obstacles: Despite the momentum, there could be challenges. Some countries might have reservations due to concerns about sovereignty, the agreement's terms, or other geopolitical reasons. These concerns could lead to a delay or a vote against the agreement. 5. Recent Developments: As of the last available information in early May 2024, if there have been positive developments, such as successful negotiations resolving key issues or a broad expression of support from a majority of member states, this would increase the likelihood of approval.

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\n\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\n\n>Tesla\u2019s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\n\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\n\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\n\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\n\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\n\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\n\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis.

AI companies themselves have acknowledged these risks [1, 2, 3], as have governments across the world [4, 5, 6] and other AI experts [7, 8, 9].\n\n> We are hopeful that these risks can be adequately mitigated with sufficient guidance from the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. However, AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.\n\n> AI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm. However, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\n\n> So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues. Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated. Some of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry.

This principle is advocated by righttowarn.ai, a group that aims to protect individuals who disclose risks associated with AI development. Firstly, we should consider OpenAI's current stance on transparency and accountability. As a leading AI research organization, OpenAI has emphasized the importance of responsible AI development and has taken steps to promote transparency in their research. However, their commitment to the specific principle of 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' is not explicitly stated. Secondly, we need to consider the potential motivations and pressures that might influence OpenAI's decision to commit to this principle. The AI research community is increasingly emphasizing the importance of ethics and accountability, and OpenAI may face pressure from researchers, policymakers, and the public to demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI development. Thirdly, we should consider the timeframe for this commitment. The question specifies that the commitment must be made before July 1, 2024, which is a relatively short timeframe. This may indicate that the question is looking for a specific response to recent events or developments in the AI research community. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of OpenAI publicly committing to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle before July 1, 2024, as follows: Probability: 0.4.

Relevance of Deepfakes in Political Discourse: Deepfakes, which are AI-generated videos, audio recordings, or photos that can be used to create convincing but false content, have become increasingly relevant in political discourse. Their potential to influence public opinion and the outcome of elections has been a topic of discussion among politicians, media, and the public. Given this relevance, it's plausible that the topic could come up in a presidential debate, especially considering the growing concerns about misinformation and disinformation in election campaigns. 2. Previous Mentions and Awareness: Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, as well as various political commentators and debate moderators, have likely been briefed on or are aware of the issue of deepfakes. Trump, in particular, has been known to discuss and sometimes propagate conspiracy theories and misinformation, which could include deepfakes. Biden, on the other hand, might address the issue from the perspective of national security, technology regulation, or the need to protect democracy from misinformation. 3. Debate Dynamics and Topics: The dynamics of a live debate can be unpredictable, with candidates often diverting from planned topics or responding to unexpected questions. If technology, social media, election interference, or misinformation come up as topics, the mention of deepfakes becomes more likely. 4. Moderators' Preparation: Debate moderators are typically well-prepared and might have questions or topics related to technology and misinformation ready, especially given the current political climate. If a moderator brings up the topic, it increases the likelihood of the word 'deepfake' being mentioned. Considering these factors, while it's difficult to predict with certainty what will be said in a live debate, the relevance of deepfakes to current political issues and the dynamics of a live debate make it plausible that the term could be mentioned."}, "prob": 0.35}, "prob": 0.35, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.6215, "brier_score": 0.1225, "brier_score_scaled": 51.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.3112, "brier_score": 0.0968, "brier_score_scaled": 61.3, "log_score": 0.5378}}

Understanding the Movies Involved: - Deadpool (2016): This was a groundbreaking film for its R-rated humor, unique storytelling, and the popularity of the Deadpool character, played by Ryan Reynolds. It had a surprisingly successful opening weekend, which contributed to its overall domestic box office success. - The Wolverine (2013): This film, starring Hugh Jackman, is part of the X-Men film series and focuses on Wolverine's character. While it did well at the box office, its domestic opening was not as strong as some of the other films in the X-Men franchise. - Deadpool & Wolverine: This upcoming film combines two of the most popular characters from the X-Men universe. The success of this film hinges on the popularity of these characters, the storyline, marketing, and how well it resonates with both old and new audiences. 2. Box Office Trends and Predictions: - The success of superhero movies has generally been on an upward trend, with many recent films breaking box office records. However, the landscape is also highly competitive, with audience preferences shifting towards streaming services and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic still being felt. - The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine could attract a broad audience, given their individual fan bases and the potential for a compelling narrative that leverages their contrasting characters. 3. Marketing and Release Timing: - The marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will play a crucial role in generating buzz and attracting viewers. Given the popularity of the characters, a well-executed campaign could significantly boost the film's opening weekend. - The release date and competition around that time will also be factors. A release during a less crowded period could help the film achieve a higher opening weekend. 4. Historical Context and Combined Opening: - The combined domestic opening of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' is $185,548,391. For 'Deadpool & Wolverine' to surpass this, it needs to generate significant interest and positive reviews to ensure a strong opening weekend. Given these considerations, the potential for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' to have a higher domestic box office opening than the combined openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' seems plausible, especially considering the popularity of the characters and the general trend of superhero movies performing well at the box office.

Past Performance: Tadej Poga\u010dar has already demonstrated his capability to win the Tour de France, having done so in 2020 and 2021. His past victories indicate a strong potential for future success. 2. Current Form: As of the last update, Poga\u010dar's form in the 2024 season would be crucial. Assuming he has maintained a high level of performance and hasn't suffered from significant injuries or setbacks, this would positively impact his chances. 3. Team Support: The strength and support of his team, UAE Team Emirates, play a significant role. A strong team can provide essential strategic and physical support during the race, enhancing his chances of winning. 4. Competition: The level of competition, including other top contenders like Jonas Vingegaard, Primoz Roglic, and Egan Bernal, affects Poga\u010dar's chances. The strategies and form of these competitors in the 2024 season would influence the race's dynamics. 5. Course Suitability: The 2024 Tour de France route and whether it suits Poga\u010dar's strengths more than his competitors also need to be considered. A route with more time trials or mountain stages could favor certain riders over others. Given these factors and assuming Poga\u010dar enters the race in good form, with strong team support, and the course layout somewhat in his favor, it would be reasonable to consider him a top contender for the win. However, without specific details on his current form, team dynamics, and the exact route of the 2024 Tour de France as of my last update, it's challenging to assign a very high probability.

The world record is slightly higher, at 6.21m, set by Sergey Bubka of Ukraine in 1994, which is also the current world record. 2.

The emergence of new talent is always a possibility, but the gap to bridge to break the record is quite narrow. 3. Technological and Training Advancements: Advances in training methods, technology (such as shoe technology), and sports science could potentially lead to improvements in performance. However, these factors have already been heavily optimized, and any further gains are likely to be marginal. 4. Environmental Factors: The conditions in Paris during the Olympics, including temperature, humidity, and wind, could affect the performance. Optimal conditions could potentially shave off a few milliseconds, but significantly breaking the record would likely require more than just favorable conditions. 5. Psychological Factors: The mental state of athletes can significantly impact their performance. The pressure of the Olympic stage can either hinder or enhance performance, but predicting this impact is challenging.

Global economic trends and significant events in these countries can have a ripple effect on the BSE SENSEX. 5. Random Events: Finally, random and unforeseen events, such as natural disasters or sudden political changes, can have unpredictable impacts on the market. Given these considerations and without access to the most current data and specific trends leading up to the date in question, a precise prediction is challenging. However, considering the volatility of the market and assuming no drastic events that would significantly skew the market from its historical trends, it's reasonable to expect fluctuations within a certain range.

Historical Performance of Swimmers: Historically, swimmers have been among the top medal winners at the Olympics. Swimmers like Michael Phelps, who holds the record for the most gold medals won by an individual in Olympic history, demonstrate the potential for high medal counts in swimming events. 2. Number of Events: Swimming offers a large number of events, which increases the potential for athletes in this sport to win multiple medals. With events in various strokes and distances, both individually and in relays, swimmers have more opportunities to compete and win medals compared to athletes in sports with fewer events. 3. Competition Level: The level of competition in swimming is extremely high, with talented athletes from around the world competing in each event. However, the same can be said for other sports, such as track and field, gymnastics, and cycling, which also have a high level of competition and multiple events. 4. Emerging Talent: Each Olympic cycle brings new talent to the forefront. The prediction of a swimmer winning the most gold medals would be bolstered if there is a known emerging talent in swimming who is expected to dominate their events. 5. Performance in Other Sports: Other sports, such as track and field, have athletes who compete in multiple events (e.g., sprinters who participate in both the 100m and 200m races, as well as relay events). These athletes also have the potential to win multiple gold medals. 6. Relay Events: Swimming has a strong team component with relay events, which can significantly increase a swimmer's medal count. However, relay events are also present in other sports, offering similar opportunities for athletes in those disciplines. Considering these points, while swimmers have historically performed well and have many opportunities to win medals, the presence of talented athletes in other sports with multiple events means that the competition for the most gold medals is not limited to swimming.

Historically, several players have won multiple medals in tennis at the Olympics. For example, the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, have both achieved this feat in the past. 2.

The decision to participate in multiple events can significantly increase an athlete's chances of winning more than one medal. 4. Skill and Dominance: The tennis world has seen periods of dominance by top players. Athletes like Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and the aforementioned Williams sisters have shown the capability to win multiple titles in a short span, including at the Olympics. 5. Injury and Fatigue: The compact schedule of the Olympics can lead to concerns about player fatigue and injury, especially for those competing in multiple events. However, top players often have the physical conditioning and support teams to manage these challenges effectively.

Warhammer 40,000 is currently the [most popular](https://icv2.com/print/article/56556) miniature wargame in the world.\n\nEach year, the World Team Championship (WTC) is organized, where 8-player teams from around the world compete against each other. The teams are separated into 4 seeding groups based on past performance. In the group stage of the tournament, 10 groups are formed with 4 teams each (one from each seeding group). Group stage performance determines the overall ranking among teams, which then compete in a further 4 games following a [Swiss format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament). The team with the most total points from the group and Swiss stages is crowned the winner.\n\nThis year, the WTC takes place in Mechelen, Belgium from August 8th to 11th. 40 national teams are competing, including 5 first-time competitors: Andorra, China, Mexico, Singapore/Thailand, and South Korea. The full list of teams and seeding groups can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=847246644093139).

Historically, the United States has been one of the top-performing countries at the Olympics, often winning the most overall medals and frequently leading in both Gold and Silver medal counts. However, the specific outcome of winning more Gold than Silver medals can vary from one Olympics to another due to numerous factors such as changes in team composition, new sports or events being added, and varying levels of competition from other countries. One way to approach this question is to look at the United States' performance in recent Olympics. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, for example, the USA won 113 medals, with 39 of them being Gold and 41 Silver. This outcome shows that the margin between Gold and Silver medals can be quite narrow. Given the uncertainty in predicting the exact distribution of medals and the inherent randomness in sports competitions, predicting the USA will win more Gold than Silver medals involves some degree of speculation. However, considering the USA's consistent strong performance and the assumption that the team's preparation and competitiveness remain at a high level, it's reasonable to believe that they could win more Gold than Silver medals. But, because the difference between Gold and Silver medals is often small and subject to a high degree of variability, and without specific data on the current team's strengths and the competition landscape, it's challenging to assign a high probability to this outcome.

Given that the resolution date is August 10th, 2024, and the created date is August 3rd, 2024, we are looking at a very specific and short time frame. In a typical week, there might be several new polls released that could affect the model's predictions. However, the impact of these polls can vary significantly depending on their results, sample sizes, and methodologies. Moreover, Nate Silver's model is known for incorporating a wide range of data, including but not limited to polls, which means other factors like economic indicators, candidate performance, and external events could also influence the model's predictions. Given the short time frame and the inherent unpredictability of political events, making a precise prediction is challenging. However, considering the nature of election forecasting models, which tend to adjust gradually unless there is a major event, a significant shift in a short period is less common but not impossible. Without access to real-time data or specific knowledge of upcoming events that could significantly impact the model, we must rely on general trends. Typically, election models like Nate Silver's do adjust over time in response to new information, but large shifts in a short period are more the exception than the rule unless prompted by a major event."}, "prob": 0.4}, "prob": 0.4, "resolution": true, "log_score": 1.3219, "brier_score": 0.36, "brier_score_scaled": -44.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.3332, "brier_score": 0.4446, "brier_score_scaled": -77.8, "log_score": 1.5854}}

Shonen Jump often publishes chapters of its series on a weekly basis, but breaks can occur for various reasons such as holidays, special events, or the author's personal schedule. Without specific information about the author's schedule, health, or any upcoming holidays that could affect publication, we must rely on general trends. Given that the resolution date is set for August 6, 2024, and assuming the standard weekly publication schedule of Shonen Jump, there would typically be a chapter released every week. However, breaks are not uncommon, especially if the author needs time to prepare for an upcoming arc, take a personal break, or if there are scheduling conflicts with other series or events in the magazine. Without access to the content of chapter 44 or any statements from the author or Shonen Jump regarding a break, we can only speculate based on common practices. The fact that the question allows for 'known-accurate leakers' to influence the resolution suggests that there might be external factors or rumors that could hint at a break, but without concrete evidence, we're left to make a general estimation. Given these considerations, a conservative estimate would lean towards the possibility of no break, simply because the default expectation for a weekly series is that it continues weekly unless otherwise stated.

However, without knowing the source of this information or having more context about Harris's preferences, team dynamics, or strategic considerations, it's challenging to assign a high probability to either of them being chosen specifically. Moreover, the fact that Harris has not yet made her choice public and the existence of this market suggests there is still uncertainty. The resolution date indicates the decision is expected before August 7th, but without real-time updates or insights into Harris's decision-making process, we must rely on general knowledge and the information given. Given these considerations, while there is some indication that Kelly and Shapiro are strong contenders, the lack of concrete evidence or more detailed insights into Harris's preferences makes it difficult to confidently predict that one of them will definitely be chosen.

He has scored points in several races and has been consistently close to his teammate, Nyck de Vries. Tsunoda's experience with the team and his familiarity with the car could give him an edge.

He has a lot of experience in Formula 1 and has won several races, including the Belgian Grand Prix in 2014. However, he has struggled in recent seasons, and his performance has been inconsistent. At the Belgian Grand Prix circuit, both drivers have had mixed results. Tsunoda has not scored any points at this circuit, while Ricciardo has had some success, including his win in 2014. However, Ricciardo's recent form has been poor, and he has not scored any points in the last few races.

Moana's Popularity: Moana is a highly successful Disney movie, and its popularity could justify the creation of a themed ride. However, the movie was released in 2016, so the peak of its popularity might have passed. 2. Magic Kingdom's Expansion: Magic Kingdom, like other Disney parks, is constantly evolving. The park has seen several expansions and renovations in recent years, including the addition of new lands and attractions. This suggests that Disney is open to investing in new experiences for its guests. 3. D23 Convention: D23 is a major event for Disney to announce new projects, including theme park attractions. If Disney is planning a new Moana ride for Magic Kingdom, D23 2024 would be a prime opportunity to announce it. 4. Previous Announcements: The prompt mentions that some attractions were discussed at the previous D23 in a \"spitballing ideas\" sense. This indicates that Disney does use D23 as a platform to gauge interest and discuss potential projects, but not all discussions lead to concrete announcements. 5. Competition and Market Demand: The theme park industry is highly competitive, especially in Florida. Disney needs to continuously innovate and expand its offerings to stay competitive. A Moana ride could be a strategic move to attract fans of the movie and families with young children. 6. Lack of Specific Information: There is no concrete information or leaks about a Moana ride being planned for Magic Kingdom. This lack of information makes it difficult to estimate the probability with high confidence. Considering these factors, while there's a rationale for why Disney might announce a Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024, the lack of specific information and the fact that not all discussions at D23 lead to announcements temper the likelihood."}, "prob": 0.35}, "prob": 0.35, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.6215, "brier_score": 0.1225, "brier_score_scaled": 51.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.3112, "brier_score": 0.0968, "brier_score_scaled": 61.3, "log_score": 0.5378}}

Her profile and political experience make her a viable candidate for the VP position. 2. Party Dynamics: The Democratic Party has shown a tendency to select tickets that offer a balance in terms of geography, ideology, and demographics. Given Harris's background as a woman of color from California, her selection could offer a strategic balance depending on the presidential nominee. 3. Strategic Considerations: The choice of VP often involves considerations about how to strengthen the ticket's appeal to certain demographics or regions. Harris's ability to energize progressive voters, her law enforcement background, and her representation of a significant state like California could make her an attractive choice. 4. Recent Trends and Speculation: Political speculation and trends up to my last update suggested that Harris was among the top contenders for the VP spot, especially if the presidential nominee sought to reinforce their ticket with someone having her profile and experience. Considering these factors, the likelihood of Kamala Harris being selected as the Democratic VP seems substantial.

Recent Trends or Events: Any recent scandals, major policy failures, or significant health concerns related to President Biden could influence Democratic Senators' decisions. However, without specific information on such events, it's difficult to gauge their impact accurately. 4. The New York Times Tracker: The resolution source is based on a tracker by The New York Times, which indicates a level of transparency and reliability in monitoring and reporting the number of Senators calling for Biden to drop out. Given these considerations, without specific recent information that would drastically alter the political landscape or Biden's standing within the Democratic Party, it seems unlikely that a significant number of Democratic Senators would publicly call for him to drop out, especially considering the potential consequences of showing division within the party ahead of the 2024 elections."}, "prob": 0.25}, "prob": 0.25, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.415, "brier_score": 0.0625, "brier_score_scaled": 75.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.2593, "brier_score": 0.0673, "brier_score_scaled": 73.1, "log_score": 0.4331}}

First, without specific details on recent controversies or criticisms directly involving Director Cheatle, we can't assume any immediate pressure for her resignation. The U.S. Secret Service has been involved in various controversies over the years, but these have not always led to the resignation of the director. Second, the political climate is crucial. Given the proximity to the 2024 presidential election, any changes in key positions like the Secret Service director might be scrutinized more than usual. However, this does not necessarily mean a change is likely; it might even suggest the opposite, as stability might be preferred during such times. Third, considering historical precedents, while there have been instances of Secret Service directors resigning or being forced out, these are relatively rare and usually tied to specific incidents or significant changes in administration. Lastly, without specific information indicating otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that Director Cheatle enjoys the confidence of the relevant authorities, given her appointment and tenure to date.

Without specific data on their training or recent race results leading up to the Tour de France 2024, we can only speculate based on their general trend of improvement and consistency. The field of competitors for the Tour de France is always strong, with several riders capable of winning. However, Pogacar and Vingegaard have consistently shown themselves to be among the top contenders, often outperforming their rivals in key stages. The risk of injury or illness affecting a rider's performance is a significant variable. Both riders have generally been consistent in their participation and performance, but any unforeseen health issues could impact their chances.

Official Duties: As the Mayor of Roswell, attending city council meetings is part of Mayor Wilson's official duties. Mayors are typically expected to be present at such meetings to lead discussions, make decisions, and represent the city's interests. This suggests a high likelihood of attendance. 2. Public Expectation and Accountability: The fact that the meeting is open to the public and is formally scheduled suggests that there is an expectation for key figures like the Mayor to be present. This public scrutiny can increase the likelihood of attendance. 3. Scheduled in Advance: The meeting is scheduled well in advance, which gives Mayor Wilson ample time to clear his schedule and make necessary arrangements to be there. This advance notice reduces the likelihood of scheduling conflicts that might prevent him from attending. 4. Remote Participation Option: The possibility of dialing in via Zoom increases the likelihood of participation, as it provides a flexible option if Mayor Wilson cannot be physically present due to unforeseen circumstances. However, the requirement for confirmation (camera on, speaking, and identifying himself) ensures that his participation is not merely nominal. 5. No Indication of Absence: There is no information provided in the prompt that suggests Mayor Wilson has any reason to be absent or has indicated that he will not attend.

Night Shyamalan's \"Trap\" (2024) having a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of at least 60%, we need to consider several factors, including the director's past performance, the genre and plot of the movie, and the general trends in film criticism. M. Night Shyamalan has a mixed track record when it comes to critical reception. Some of his films, such as \"The Sixth Sense\" (86%), \"Unbreakable\" (70%), and \"Split\" (76%), have received high praise from critics. However, others, like \"The Last Airbender\" (6%), \"The Happening\" (20%), and \"Glass\" (37%), have been panned. His most recent film, \"Knock at the Cabin\", received a mediocre score of 67%. Given this variability, it's challenging to predict with certainty how \"Trap\" will be received. However, considering Shyamalan's recent efforts to regain his critical footing and the fact that \"Trap\" is a thriller, a genre he has had success with in the past, it's reasonable to assume that the film might lean towards a more positive reception. Moreover, the plot of \"Trap\" remains somewhat under wraps, which could either work in its favor by piquing interest or against it if the mystery doesn't translate well to the screen. The lack of detailed information about the plot makes it harder to gauge potential critical reaction accurately. Rotten Tomatoes scores can also be influenced by factors such as the time of year, competition, and cultural context at the time of release. August is typically considered a slower month for major film releases, which might affect the pool of critics reviewing the film and potentially its overall score. Given these considerations, while it's difficult to predict with certainty, there seems to be a slight inclination towards a positive reception based on Shyamalan's efforts to improve and his past successes in the thriller genre. However, the mixed track record and variables outside of the film itself temper this optimism."}, "prob": 0.55}, "prob": 0.55, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.152, "brier_score": 0.3025, "brier_score_scaled": -21.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.3888, "brier_score": 0.1511, "brier_score_scaled": 39.6, "log_score": 0.7102}}

This indicates that he is open to in-depth conversations, increasing the likelihood of another such interview occurring. 2. Public Engagement and Media Strategy: As the President of the United States, Joe Biden and his team likely understand the importance of media appearances for reaching the public directly, discussing policy, and influencing public opinion. Given the upcoming elections and the need to address various national and international issues, there's a strategic benefit to engaging in substantial interviews. 3. Availability of Platforms: With the proliferation of media platforms, including podcasts, late-night shows, and in-depth interview programs like '60 Minutes,' there are numerous opportunities for the President to engage in lengthy, on-camera conversations. 4. Time Constraints and Scheduling: The President's schedule is incredibly tight, with numerous commitments, including governance, diplomacy, and campaigning. This could limit the availability for lengthy interviews, though it doesn't eliminate the possibility, especially if such interviews are seen as strategically beneficial. 5. Health and Energy Levels: Speculation about Joe Biden's health and energy levels could influence perceptions about his ability or willingness to engage in lengthy interviews. However, his recent performances in public appearances and interviews suggest he remains capable and willing to participate in such engagements.

However, the intensity and importance of these games can sometimes lead to increased tensions and, consequently, more severe fouls. 2. Tournament Discipline: UEFA tournaments are known for their strict disciplinary standards. Referees are instructed to enforce the rules strictly to maintain fair play and player safety. This could increase the likelihood of red cards for serious fouls. 3. Player and Team Dynamics: The semi-finals feature teams that have made it through the group stages and quarter-finals, indicating they are highly competitive and possibly more evenly matched. This competitiveness can lead to increased aggression and, potentially, more fouls. 4. Yellow Card Accumulation: Players who have accumulated yellow cards in the group stages and quarter-finals might be more cautious to avoid a second yellow, which would result in a red card. However, the pressure of a semi-final might still lead to impulsive decisions. 5. Referee Influence: The referees chosen for semi-final matches are typically experienced and have a track record of managing high-pressure games. Their experience might lead to better game management, potentially reducing the likelihood of red cards, but they are also under scrutiny to enforce the rules strictly.

While there have been various controversies and criticisms during his presidency, there's no concrete evidence to suggest he plans to step down. 2. Health Issues: President Biden's health has been a subject of public interest, but as of the latest available information, he has not announced any severe health issues that would force him to relinquish his duties as President permanently. 3. Impeachment and Removal: The process of impeachment and removal from office is lengthy and requires a significant amount of time and bipartisan support. Given the current political climate and the timeline before the end of July 2024, this seems highly improbable. 4. Death: Unfortunately, predicting someone's passing is impossible without specific information about a severe health condition. As of the last public update, there was no such indication regarding President Biden. 5. Temporary Transfer of Power under the 25th Amendment: The prompt explicitly states that a temporary transfer of power does not cause a NO resolution.

Secondly, he must also announce his resignation from the presidency before the end of July 2024, Pacific Time. It's crucial to note that the actual resignation doesn't have to occur before the end of July; an announcement of his intention to resign is sufficient. Given these conditions, let's assess the likelihood. Joe Biden's decision to run for re-election or resign would be influenced by various factors, including his health, public opinion, the state of the economy, and the political landscape. However, without specific information indicating otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that a sitting president, especially one who has been in public service for as long as Joe Biden, would not make such significant decisions lightly or suddenly unless under extraordinary circumstances. Historically, U.S. presidents rarely resign, with Richard Nixon being the most notable exception due to the Watergate scandal. While Joe Biden has faced challenges during his presidency, there's no current indication of a scandal or issue severe enough to prompt a resignation announcement before the end of July 2024. Moreover, the Democratic Party's dynamics and the process of selecting a presidential candidate also suggest that sudden, drastic changes are unlikely without a compelling reason. The party would need time to adjust and prepare another candidate for the election, making a sudden resignation and withdrawal from the race before the end of July even less likely. Considering these factors, the probability that Joe Biden announces both his withdrawal from the presidential race and his resignation from office before the end of July 2024 is low."}, "prob": 0.05}, "prob": 0.05, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.074, "brier_score": 0.0025, "brier_score_scaled": 99.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.0938, "brier_score": 0.0088, "brier_score_scaled": 96.5, "log_score": 0.1421}}

Firstly, the 2024 Democratic National Convention, where the party's nominee for the presidential election will be officially selected, is crucial. Before this event, it's common for potential nominees to engage in debates to present their policies, visions, and leadership qualities to the public and party members. These debates are significant in helping voters decide on their preferred candidate and in shaping the party's platform. Given the broad field of potential Democratic nominees, including figures like Harris, Newsom, Whitmer, and the incumbent President Biden, there is a clear diversity of opinion and policy approaches within the party. This diversity often leads to lively debates as candidates seek to differentiate themselves and win over supporters. Historically, debates have been a staple of the nomination process for both major parties in the United States. They are seen as essential for democratic transparency, allowing candidates to be scrutinized by the public and the press. The Democratic Party, in particular, has used debates as a platform to showcase its candidates' ideas on various issues, from healthcare and the economy to climate change and social justice. Considering these factors, it is reasonable to expect that there will be at least one more Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention. Such debates would provide a necessary platform for candidates to articulate their positions and for voters to make informed decisions about who should lead the party into the 2024 presidential election."}, "prob": 0.85}, "prob": 0.85, "resolution": false, "log_score": 2.737, "brier_score": 0.7225, "brier_score_scaled": -189.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.4693, "brier_score": 0.2202, "brier_score_scaled": 11.9, "log_score": 0.914}}

Director's Track Record: Lee Isaac Chung, the director of \"Twisters\" (2024), has previously directed \"Minari\" (2020), which received widespread critical acclaim and holds a 98% Rotten Tomatoes score. This suggests Chung has the capability to produce high-quality films that critics appreciate. 2. Cast Performance History: The film stars Glen Powell, known for his role in \"Top Gun: Maverick\" (2022), a film that holds a 96% Rotten Tomatoes score, and Daisy Edgar-Jones, who starred in \"Normal People\" (2020), a series that received a 91% Rotten Tomatoes score. The past success of the cast members in well-received productions could positively influence the reception of \"Twisters\". 3. Original Film Reception: The original \"Twister\" (1996) has a 63% Rotten Tomatoes score. While this is below the 75% threshold we're considering for \"Twisters\" (2024), the nearly three decades since the original's release have seen advancements in filmmaking technology and changes in audience and critic preferences, potentially allowing the sequel to improve upon the original's reception. 4. Sequel and Franchise Dynamics: Being a standalone sequel, \"Twisters\" (2024) has the opportunity to both draw from the original's concept and offer something new. This balance can be challenging but also rewarding if executed well, potentially leading to a higher critics' score. 5. Critical Reception Trends: Critics' scores can be influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural relevance, technical achievements, and the overall quality of storytelling. Given the current trends in filmmaking, where sequels and reboots are scrutinized for their necessity and originality, \"Twisters\" (2024) would need to demonstrate significant merit to achieve a high score. Considering these factors, the presence of a talented director and cast, combined with the potential for improvement over the original and the challenges inherent in producing a well-received sequel, suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook for \"Twisters\" (2024) achieving a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of at least 75%."}, "prob": 0.62}, "prob": 0.62, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.6897, "brier_score": 0.1444, "brier_score_scaled": 42.24, "platt": {"factor": 0.757, "calibrated_prob": 0.4105, "brier_score": 0.3475, "brier_score_scaled": -39.0, "log_score": 1.2845}}

However, without specific information about the series' schedule, the author's past behavior regarding breaks, or any announcements from Shonen Jump, it's challenging to make a highly informed prediction. In the absence of detailed information, we can consider general practices in manga publication. It's not uncommon for manga series to have breaks between chapters, especially if the author needs time to work on the next part or if there are scheduling conflicts. However, the frequency and predictability of these breaks can vary greatly depending on the series and the author. Given the lack of specific information and considering general practices, a moderate probability seems reasonable.

Tournament Strategy: In major tournaments, teams often aim to maintain consistency in their lineup, especially if they've found a winning formula. However, the need to rest players, especially key ones, to avoid fatigue and injuries is also crucial, especially in the group stages where teams might feel they can afford to make changes without risking their chances of advancing. 2. Opponent Consideration: The perceived strength of the opponent can also influence lineup decisions. Against stronger teams, managers might opt for what they believe is their strongest lineup, while against weaker teams, they might see an opportunity to give some players a rest. 3. Uruguay's Position and Strategy: Without knowing the exact situation of Uruguay's standings in the group at the time of the match against the US, it's difficult to pinpoint their strategy. However, if they are in a comfortable position, they might choose to rest players. If the match is crucial for their advancement, they might stick with a more consistent lineup. 4. Player Availability and Fitness: The fitness level of players after the Panama match and any injuries sustained could also significantly influence the lineup against the US. If several key players are nursing injuries or are deemed at risk of injury due to fatigue, Uruguay might be forced to make changes. 5. Recent Trends and Managerial Preferences: The managerial style of Uruguay's coach and any trends observed in their previous matches could also provide clues. Some managers prefer a more consistent lineup, while others are more willing to make changes based on the opponent and player condition. Given these considerations, without specific information on Uruguay's situation in the tournament, player fitness, and the managerial approach, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

The Peoplemover, originally opened in 1967, was a popular attraction that offered aerial views of Tomorrowland. It closed in 1995, but there has been consistent fan interest in its return. Given the criteria for what constitutes a new version of the Peoplemover (including having portions with views above Tomorrowland and at least two specific characteristics related to the original ride), the announcement would need to be quite detailed to confirm it meets these requirements. D23 Expo is a major event where Disney often announces new projects and attractions. Given the nostalgia and demand for the Peoplemover's return, it's plausible that Disney could announce a project that incorporates elements of the original ride to capitalize on this nostalgia and demand. However, the specific criteria for this question make it somewhat narrow, as not just any announcement about a new ride or attraction in Tomorrowland would qualify. Considering Disney's trend of reviving and reimagining classic attractions, and the specific interest in the Peoplemover, there's a reasonable chance that they might announce something that fits the bill. However, without insider information or leaks, it's difficult to estimate this probability with high confidence.
