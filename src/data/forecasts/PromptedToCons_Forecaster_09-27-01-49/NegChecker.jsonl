Hence, I estimate this probability at a relatively high value, such as 0.70.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P. Given my estimate for P, this would be 1 - P, resulting in a probability of 0.30.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is effectively the same as P, so I would assign the same probability of 0.70.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024)**: Given the current trends in the crypto market and Musk's influence, I would assign a moderate probability of 0.60 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: This probability will depend on the independence of P and Q. Given that these events can be somewhat independent but may also influence each other, I estimate this probability to be lower than both P and Q, around 0.40.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability should be higher than both individual probabilities, so I would estimate it at around 0.80, as at least one of these events is likely to happen.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs but not P)**: This is a bit tricky since if Musk shows up at the conference, he might also announce something. However, there can be situations where he announces something without being present at the conference, so I estimate this at a lower probability of 0.15.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given that P occurs)**: If Musk shows up at the conference, the likelihood of him making an announcement increases. Therefore, I estimate this probability to be higher, around 0.75.\n\nOverall, these estimates should be consistent with the rules provided. For instance, the complement rule (neg) should hold, and the relationships between the probabilities of combined events should also align with the given consistency rules. I need to ensure that the estimates do not contradict any of the logical relationships defined in the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.80 + 0.40 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.70, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.60) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.40 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.60,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-27T01:49:38.949969", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d2658c6f-40ca-4b75-99f2-f2ee886f6bf4'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c421cc1e-f716-4443-8651-d87acf5ee3c4'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('3e19d419-bb67-4f05-8a51-486dfbc03d96'), title='Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('70cb5eba-82ba-46b9-bdba-d326c01edf40'), title='Will Elon Musk make a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024?', body='This question will resolve YES if Elon Musk publicly announces a new initiative or project related to Bitcoin at any event or platform in 2024.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_and_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('dfb6e28d-0679-4ff5-aeec-d949c9411751'), title='Will both of the following occur: (a) Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and (b) make a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES if (a) Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024, and (b) Elon Musk publicly announces a new initiative or project related to Bitcoin at any event or platform in 2024.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_or_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d238c78c-a19a-4367-a625-f5bc6b60051a'), title='Will either of the following occur: (a) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?

The likelihood of him attending could be influenced by various factors, including his schedule, interest in Bitcoin, and the significance of the event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If we estimate P at a certain probability, not_P will be 1 minus that probability. \n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is essentially asking whether there is a reasonable chance of P occurring, which should align closely with the probability of P itself.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a surprise announcement related to Bitcoin during 2024)**: This event is independent of P since it can occur at any time throughout the year and does not rely on his attendance at the Bitcoin conference. However, there may be some correlation if he chooses to announce something significant at the conference itself.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: The probability of both events occurring should be less than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q, reflecting the dependency relationship. If P is true, it might increase the likelihood of Q occurring, but they are not strictly dependent.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This probability should reflect the likelihood of at least one of the events happening. It must be greater than or equal to the maximum of P and Q and less than or equal to the sum of both probabilities minus their intersection.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not_P occurs)**: This scenario is possible if Elon Musk makes an announcement but does not appear at the conference. The probability of this event will depend on the likelihood of Q occurring independently of P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given that P occurs)**: This conditional probability should reflect how likely Q is if we know P is true. This is likely to be higher than the base probability of Q, as his presence at the conference may lead to announcements.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities assigned must respect the logical relationships outlined by the consistency rules. The events P and Q are not mutually exclusive but do have a dependent relationship, particularly in the context of Q_given_P. Therefore, careful consideration must be taken to ensure that the estimates reflect these nuances.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.13107742334259087, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.06553871167129544, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5285465537879277, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
