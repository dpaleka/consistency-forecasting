A letter crafted by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO, offers the first public indication from Democrats since the recent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump that many of their members remain quite apprehensive about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIt\u2019s a really poor decision by the DNC. Someone thinks this is a clever tactic to suppress debate and, I suppose, through sheer force, achieve unity, but that\u2019s not how it works,\u201d Huffman remarked in an interview. He declined to confirm whether a letter exists.
