Should Biden participate in another such in-person interview of at least 45 minutes, this condition will not be met. This requirement excludes press conferences, speeches, rallies, fundraisers, and town halls. It includes appearances on podcasts or late-night shows, or an interview that has been edited into a program like 60 Minutes, but there must be no less than 45 minutes of new footage featuring Biden being interviewed in person.\n\nGiven this requirement, will Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden be more than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average? This question will be answered based on the margin by which Donald Trump is ahead of Joe Biden in 538's national polling average for the 2024 presidential election as reported on the chart dated July 15, 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024. A positive figure indicates a lead for Trump, while a negative figure shows Biden is leading. For example, as of July 5, 2024, the reported value for that date indicates Trump leading Biden by 2.4 points.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-01 14:03:51+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-08 19:24:44+00:00", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.65, "elicitation_metadata": null}}}]}}}]}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08841392566363715, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
