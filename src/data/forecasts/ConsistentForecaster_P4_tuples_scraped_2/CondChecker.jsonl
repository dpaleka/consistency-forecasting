One poll requests Manifold respondents to indicate their vote for Joe Biden on a hypothetical ballot, while the other solicits their vote for a generic Democrat on a similar ballot. Consistent results from public opinion surveys reveal that Joe Biden is falling behind Donald Trump beyond the margin of error, whereas every other Democratic candidate assessed in hypothetical situations is either ahead or within the margin of error. This market will be deemed YES if the percentage of votes for Donald Trump in the first poll exceeds that in the second poll by 3% or more at the time both polls close. The formula for calculating Trump's vote percentage is (Trump / (Trump + (the Democrat in question) + Someone else)). The result is YES if the difference between the calculations for poll 1 and poll 2 is greater than or equal to 0.03. If not, the result is NO.\n\n(b) The market will resolve based on the USD/JPY closing rate reported for August 9th, 2024 on Yahoo! Finance.

This question resolves YES if the percentage of votes for Donald Trump in the poll with Joe Biden exceeds that in the poll with a generic Democrat by 3% or more when both polls close.
