A letter drafted and shared by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO serves as the first public indication from Democrats following the recent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump that many of their members are still deeply worried about Biden\u2019s future candidacy. \u201cThis is a very poor decision by the DNC. Someone believes it\u2019s a smart tactic to restrict debate and, by sheer force, achieve unity, but that\u2019s not how it works,\u201d Huffman stated in an interview.
