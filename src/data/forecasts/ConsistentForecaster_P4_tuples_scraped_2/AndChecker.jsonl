Before July 1, 2024, OpenAI makes a public declaration regarding the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle through a statement from the company or its representative, such as Sam Altman. This statement can be either formal (like a press release) or informal (such as a tweet or a quote from an interview). The statement must indicate a new commitment to the principle compared to the time the righttowarn.ai statement was issued; it cannot merely reiterate that \"we already promote a culture of open criticism\". Additionally, Metaculus must verify that the company has embraced the principle to the satisfaction of at least one member of righttowarn.ai. Metaculus may reach out to selected signatories or endorsers to assess their satisfaction with OpenAI's commitment. The statements must be at least as strong as \"this was a good first step\" for this condition to be resolved as **Yes**.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-01 17:47:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-05-09 14:30:00+00:00", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.3, "elicitation_metadata": null}}}]}}}]}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
