With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.6941766070884623}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "91b69c30-0e35-4bb4-b760-2db9899a24db", "title": "KvFnYosyJenqiIMHnXAN", "body": "NcMrrfURpOGoMKnUlNDt", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": false, "elicited_prob": 0.34344550618763203}}, "CondChecker": {"Q_given_P": {"id": "5199d34d-5b93-4b54-8efa-78a9d30ef055", "title": "ZczYiRvSCsphdpZvbghn", "body": "HcvzMZJLgAdwoqZIukDA", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.16236990981554592}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "5220abf9-8f2e-451e-b593-627eb54bbc58", "title": "TWGoFhNuqWWLyQQQmGVm", "body": "FqjbvQrwWQMzTukYwGNs", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.9480688107626456}}}}, "not_P": {"id": "590ada68-29ed-4e79-bb65-b977d5dc403c", "title": "Will the price of water on the NQH20 not hit $2,500 (2021 USD) per acre-foot by 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if the price of water does not hit $2500, adjusted for inflation to 2021 USD, on the NQH20 by 2050-01-01, 00:00 UTC.

Non-state actors have never yet detonated nuclear weapons, but there are conceivable scenarios in which they could:\nThe majority of nuclear security experts identify two primary scenarios involving nuclear weapons and non-state actors. The first scenario involves the acquisition of a nuclear device from the existing arsenals of nuclear-armed States by terrorists or other non-state actors.

Bostrom states the following:\n\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody's still in a Malthusian condition.\"\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n\"The human condition,\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively.

Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody's still in a Malthusian condition.\"\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n\"The human condition,\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n\nAdditionally, the second component of the question is whether JvdyxWaVHAdREImrRBHs is true.", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.6941766070884623}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "cbec86bd-d786-456d-b2b7-8c0504bedde9", "title": "xtSKrZuoBvWVQdgbKqUN", "body": "cFdUmgdUOexKTHezbEzf", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": false, "elicited_prob": 0.34344550618763203}}, "CondChecker": {"Q_given_P": {"id": "1dea9d07-5f71-4816-b787-54031832de1a", "title": "mlBrYSAjIKLEtFSwwnxM", "body": "WnJuIdLbecnfJgluTzPK", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.16236990981554592}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "91d78769-85b9-4dd3-acc0-7c9bbbbdfb7f", "title": "sGIJTDAjBNQgDtblaCQg", "body": "mftOjOrvtVMsikpbMpLv", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.9480688107626456}}}}}}

Grant, who sought to serve a third term in 1880, though that was eleven years after he had left the oval office. A more serious case was Theodore Roosevelt. President William McKinley was assassinated still in the first year of his second term and Vice President Roosevelt had to take over. He forewent a consecutive third term, since he felt term limits were a good check on dictatorships, being succeeded by William H. Taft. But due to his dissatisfaction with President Taft\u2019s political acumen Roosevelt sought a third term for the 1912 election, heading the Progressive Party, thus once more straining the traditional two term limits, but due to his defeat at the hands of Woodrow Wilson the tradition remained true.\nCalvin Coolidge, following the sudden death of his predecessor Warren G. Harding in August 1923, was confirmed in the 1924 election, but then chose not to run, later on citing 10 years in Washington would be too long for any man.\nOnly when Franklin D. Roosevelt took over the helm was the tradition broken. Buoyed by his success in dealing with the Great Depression and trusting only his own political experience in dealing with the Nazis currently sweeping through Western Europe, he sought and won a third term in 1940. Despite being aware of his ailing health, he also sought and won a fourth consecutive term, but considered resigning once the war was over. Three months into his fourth term his health declined rapidly and he died, making place for his Vice President Harry S.

Bostrom states the following:\n\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody's still in a Malthusian condition.\"\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n\"The human condition,\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.8032418475442701}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "2f875c2b-a844-4fde-a1fe-47fdd61fc007", "title": "qHylpufWkUuDzGXgUOKl", "body": "GKFhLrUrgkOFymNDqGyj", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.0163687844844998}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "886dae64-89b5-420e-bccc-633501e4beb3", "title": "nEbTLCieXqumisIHYZgw", "body": "TnLfaZwhxQKpAtjxVApW", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": false, "elicited_prob": 0.7997028667961518}}, "ButChecker": {"Q_and_not_P": {"id": "1399a529-ddec-4d15-841a-cf814b648d51", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Will the human condition change fundamentally before 2100?

[...]\nThe success of the procedure is not, however, limited to children. A study in 2007 indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades. A case study published in 2015 of 2 adults aged 48 and 38 demonstrated the success of functional hemispherectomy in treating status epilepticus (SE), an epileptic condition in which seizures are prolonged or occur closely together. In 2012, a case study following 30 individuals having undergone some form of hemispherectomy in adulthood found that 81% of individuals were seizure free post-procedure.

Bostrom states the following:\n\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition?\n\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, Industrial Revolution, where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody's still in a Malthusian condition.\"\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is machine intelligence.\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\nThe question we ask here is: Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?\n\"The human condition,\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level.\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\nResolution\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\n", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.8032418475442701}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "18ebe9cf-245b-4a0f-912d-04b53bb66a10", "title": "zxEastxKbzsktmrvKQHK", "body": "JUOavGLuNPzSgIiEvQsJ", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.0163687844844998}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "23918851-60ab-4d2c-84d4-caa580718f73", "title": "QvigwQwigEmtlZtUJIwO", "body": "zJwsPHdLrHZryVMNLXPG", "resolution_date": "2099-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": false, "elicited_prob": 0.7997028667961518}}, "ButChecker": {"Q_and_not_P": {"id": "09ce2ed3-3bf2-40b1-9a1b-1dd379796014", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) The human condition change fundamentally before 2100 (as defined by the criteria set forth regarding significant social complexity, economic productivity, and technological capability) and (2) pKqLOTFygdXGECxwGNJs?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\n1.

With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.\nAdditionally, it must be determined whether the question 'oILpQbZcCVwZJZmOXenZ' is true.", "resolution_date": "2100-01-01 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.6941766070884623}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "f8141a10-5ef1-4be7-bd80-59cdcbd98e6c", "title": "RbYgbhMjhzVkzfGXGQrm", "body": "crmqBfsZHaMHBeOQnCTa", "resolution_date": "2100-01-01 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": false, "elicited_prob": 0.34344550618763203}}, "CondChecker": {"Q_given_P": {"id": "04be83a5-715b-4cae-9583-adc1cf9b7d4d", "title": "nxQLIRKgykDNaFFzYbsP", "body": "hcvwitjHGZojiFtIDeEb", "resolution_date": "2100-01-01 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.16236990981554592}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "c7752901-47b7-49c6-a575-5fcff78d9ccc", "title": "EEfxVaCvmghVISqDqGQl", "body": "tLBBtYqeRNiFMMKEYwmZ", "resolution_date": "2100-01-01 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.9480688107626456}}}}, "not_P": {"id": "68e38fe6-0826-49c0-ab46-30a17d27e3d5", "title": "Will the next assassination of a sitting US President occur on or before January 1, 2100?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if any US President serving from January 20, 2017 to January 1, 2100 is successfully assassinated during their term.\nAny assassination attempt which does not lead directly to a US President's medical death will not trigger resolution.
