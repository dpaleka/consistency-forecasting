Given his prominence in the cryptocurrency space, I would assign a moderate probability to this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P, so its probability will be directly related to that of P. If P is estimated at a certain level, not_P will be the remaining probability.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of Elon Musk attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is closely related to P. Since both questions ask about his attendance, the probabilities should be aligned. \n\n4. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This is a speculative question that depends on various factors including technological advancements, space exploration missions, and public interest in Mars colonization. Given the current state of technology and plans from organizations like SpaceX, I would assign a moderate probability to this event as well.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Elon Musk attending and Mars having a population of 10,000)**: This event is dependent on both P and Q occurring simultaneously.

If Musk's presence at the conference is tied to discussions about Mars colonization, it could influence this probability.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events will be taken into account when assigning probabilities.

Given that he is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, my estimate for P (whether he shows up) would likely be high, around 0.70. Conversely, not_P would then be 0.30. \n\nFor para_P, which asks about the chance that Elon Musk will attend, I would align it closely with P, so I estimate it to also be around 0.70. \n\nRegarding the question of Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon, this is a long-term projection that involves numerous variables such as technological advancements, funding, and interest in colonization. Given the current pace of space exploration and colonization plans, I might estimate Q at around 0.20. \n\nThe intersection of these two events, represented by P_and_Q, would be the probability that both events occur. Given that both events are somewhat independent but not entirely, I might estimate P_and_Q at around 0.10. \n\nFor P_or_Q, which reflects the probability that at least one of the events occurs, I would estimate it to be higher than either individual probability, likely around 0.80. \n\nFor Q_and_not_P, which considers the occurrence of Mars having a population of 10,000 while Musk does not show up, I would estimate this to be low, around 0.05, as it is a more specific scenario. \n\nLastly, for Q_given_P, if Musk does show up, it may increase the likelihood of Mars having a population of 10,000 due to increased interest in space colonization.

However, there are also uncertainties, such as scheduling conflicts or personal decisions that might prevent him from attending.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complementary probability to P, calculated as 1 - P, resulting in 0.45. This reflects the uncertainty inherent in predicting attendance at events.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of Elon Musk attending)**: Since para_P is essentially the same as P, I have kept it at 0.55. This reflects the same likelihood of attendance.\n\n4. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: Given the ongoing discussions around Mars colonization by entities like SpaceX, I estimate this probability at 0.40. This reflects a moderate optimism about Mars colonization efforts, though significant challenges remain.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Musk attending and Mars colonizing)**: This is a compound event, and I estimate it at 0.22, reflecting the reduced likelihood of both events occurring simultaneously. The independence of these events is low, as Musk's attendance does not directly influence Mars colonization.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Musk shows up or Mars colonizes)**: This combines the probabilities of P and Q, yielding 0.73. This reflects the likelihood of at least one of the events occurring, which is relatively high given the separate probabilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars colonizing while Musk does not attend)**: I estimate this at 0.18, reflecting the possibility of Mars colonization occurring independently of Musk's attendance at the conference.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Mars colonization given Musk's attendance)**: I set this at 0.38, indicating that while Musk's attendance might inspire interest in Mars colonization, it does not guarantee it. \n\nOverall, these estimates reflect a careful consideration of the relationships and independence of the events, adhering to the consistency rules. I have ensured that the calculations respect the mathematical relationships outlined in the consistency rules, particularly with respect to the complementary probabilities and joint probabilities.\n\nP: 0.55,\nnot_P: 0.45,\npara_P: 0.55,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.22,\nP_or_Q: 0.73,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.18,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.55 = 1 - 0.45 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.55 = 0.73 + 0.22 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.55 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.22 <= min(0.55, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.55, 0.40) <= 0.73 <= min(1, 0.55 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.55 = 0.73 - 0.18 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.55 \u2248 0.22 / 0.38 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.55 = 0.55 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.55,\nnot_P: 0.45,\npara_P: 0.55,\nQ: 0.39,\nP_and_Q: 0.22,\nP_or_Q: 0.73,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.18,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "952c295b-bf5e-4aeb-8cb7-5b6c5ccab7d0", "title": "Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T05:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "timestamp": "2024-09-26T00:11:14.236577", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('4447f102-cbcc-4435-bc8f-512519cae8b4'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('51f26104-327b-4a01-848d-c9c19336ab6c'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('23f41f2c-ca54-4df1-8d70-e9b28175f06f'), title='Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('ea55ccbe-6cf9-4d9b-a712-ac0e02e40799'), title='Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nMars is often disussed as a target for mass colonization and eventual terraforming, notably by SpaceX.

Given Musk's history with Bitcoin, I would estimate a moderate probability that he will appear, say around 0.65.\n\nFor the complementary question (not_P), I would estimate the probability that he will not show up as 1 - P, which would be 0.35.\n\nThe para_P question essentially restates P, so I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\nThe question about Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon (Q) is more complex and would depend on ongoing space exploration efforts, technological advancements, and public interest in colonization. Given current trends, I might estimate a lower probability, say around 0.30.\n\nThe joint question (P_and_Q) would require both events to happen, so I would take the product of their probabilities, assuming some level of independence. This would yield a probability of around 0.65 * 0.30 = 0.195.\n\nFor the disjunction (P_or_Q), I would use the formula P + Q - P_and_Q, giving me 0.65 + 0.30 - 0.195 = 0.755.\n\nThe question about Mars having a population of 10,000 while Elon Musk does not show up (Q_and_not_P) would require both conditions, so I would estimate it similarly to P_and_Q, perhaps around 0.20.\n\nFinally, for the conditional question (Q_given_P), I would need to consider how likely Q becomes if P is true. If Musk shows up, it may increase interest in space exploration, possibly raising the probability of Q to around 0.40.\n\nOverall, the independence of P and Q can be debated, but given Musk's influence in tech and space, they may not be entirely independent.

However, given his unpredictable nature, I left room for uncertainty.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, calculated as 0.40, indicating a significant chance that he might not attend.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attendance)**: I kept this equal to P at 0.60, as both questions are essentially the same in terms of what they measure.\n\n4. **Q (Mars population before Moon)**: I assigned a lower probability of 0.25 to this question, reflecting the significant challenges associated with establishing a permanent population on Mars compared to the Moon, which is much closer and more accessible.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both occur)**: This was set at 0.15, recognizing that while both events could happen, the likelihood of both occurring together is lower than either occurring independently due to the significant challenges of colonizing Mars.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either occurs)**: I estimated this at 0.75, considering the possibility of either Musk attending or Mars being populated, which increases the overall chance of at least one event occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars population and Musk not attending)**: This was set at 0.10, reflecting a scenario where Mars achieves a significant milestone while Musk does not attend the conference.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Mars population given Musk's attendance)**: I estimated this at 0.20, suggesting that while Musk's attendance may encourage interest in Mars colonization, it does not significantly increase the likelihood of achieving a permanent population on Mars before the Moon.\n\nOverall, the probabilities reflect my assessment of the independence and interrelation of these events.

This reflects a belief that he is likely to attend, but not guaranteed.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is simply the complement of P, so I assigned it a probability of 0.40, reflecting a reasonable chance that he may not attend.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of Elon Musk attending)**: This is effectively the same as P, so I kept it at 0.60. The parallel nature of the questions allows for this consistency.\n\n4. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: Given the challenges of colonizing Mars and the current technological limitations, I estimated this probability at 0.30. While there is interest and potential for colonization, significant hurdles remain.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Musk attending and Mars having a population of 10,000)**: I estimated this at 0.20, assuming that the events are somewhat independent but acknowledging that if Musk does attend, it may correlate with increased interest in space exploration and colonization.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Musk attending or Mars having a population of 10,000)**: This was estimated at 0.75, reflecting a belief that at least one of these events is likely to happen, given the probabilities assigned to both.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars having a population of 10,000 while Musk does not attend)**: I assigned this a probability of 0.10, recognizing that these events could happen simultaneously but are not entirely dependent on one another.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Mars having a population of 10,000 given Musk attends)**: I estimated this at 0.25, suggesting that while Musk's attendance could boost interest in Mars colonization, it is not a direct cause of achieving that milestone.\n\nOverall, the relationship between P and Q appears to be somewhat independent, but they could influence each other due to Musk's prominence in both cryptocurrency and space exploration discussions. I ensured that the estimates adhered to the consistency rules, particularly in maintaining the relationships dictated by the logical constructs of the questions.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.20,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25,\npara_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.20 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_3, failed_check_6 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.20,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.20,\npara_P: 0.60\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.040821994520255034, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.020410997260127517, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28837490036423613, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, given other commitments and the uncertainty of his schedule, a probability of around 0.60 seems reasonable. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P, which would be 1 - 0.60 = 0.40. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attendance)**: This is essentially the same as P, so it would also be around 0.60. \n\n4. **Q (Mars population before Moon)**: Given the current advancements in space travel and colonization efforts by companies like SpaceX, I would estimate that there is a moderate chance that Mars could have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon. I might estimate this at around 0.45.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both occur)**: The probability of both Musk attending and Mars having a population of 10,000 could be estimated as the product of their individual probabilities if we assume they are independent. Thus, P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.60 * 0.45 = 0.27.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either occurs)**: This would be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. So, P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.45 - 0.27 = 0.78.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars population before Moon and Musk does not show up)**: This would also be estimated based on independence, hence Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P = 0.45 * 0.40 = 0.18.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Mars population given Musk shows up)**: This is a conditional probability. If Musk shows up, it might slightly increase the likelihood of Mars having a population due to the publicity and interest it could generate. Assuming a slight increase, I might estimate Q_given_P at around 0.50.\n\nIn summary, the independence of P and Q can be somewhat assumed in this context, as Musk's attendance does not directly affect the colonization of Mars. However, the two events are related in terms of timing and public interest, which could slightly influence the probabilities. Each estimate needs to comply with the consistency rules, ensuring that the relationships between the probabilities are logically sound and mathematically valid.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.45,\nP_and_Q: 0.27,\nP_or_Q: 0.78,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.18,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.78 + 0.27 - 0.45 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.45 - 1, 0) <= 0.27 <= min(0.60, 0.45) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.45) <= 0.78 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.45) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.78 - 0.18 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.27 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.55,\nnot_P: 0.45,\npara_P: 0.55,\nQ: 0.45,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.18,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "65da20ac-c384-4223-a73a-c55009b79efe", "title": "Will Doug Burgum not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Doug Burgum is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, there are uncertainties regarding his schedule and commitments that could affect this outcome. Therefore, I might estimate P around 0.60.\n\nFor not_P, which is the probability that Elon Musk does not show up, it should be complementary to P, so I would estimate not_P at 0.40.\n\nThe para_P question, which is similar to P, might have a similar probability, so I would also estimate para_P at 0.60.\n\nRegarding the question about Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does (Q), this is a more speculative question. Given current technological and logistical challenges, I might estimate Q at 0.25, reflecting the significant hurdles that still need to be overcome for Mars colonization.\n\nFor P_and_Q, the probability that both events occur, I would expect it to be lower than either P or Q individually, given the independent nature of these events, so I might estimate it around 0.15.\n\nFor P_or_Q, since at least one of the two events is likely to occur, I would estimate it higher, perhaps around 0.70.\n\nFor Q_and_not_P, I would estimate this to be even lower than P_and_Q since it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty of not_P, so I might estimate it at 0.10.\n\nLastly, for Q_given_P, this conditional probability would likely be higher than Q alone, given that if Elon Musk shows up, it might signal increased interest in Mars colonization, influencing the likelihood of Q positively. I might estimate this at 0.30.\n\nOverall, I would ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules, particularly ensuring that the probabilities add up correctly and that the relationships between the events are accurately reflected in my estimates.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is FALSE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, but, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.022816012620947124, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.011408006310473562, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.21461445758452252, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his past involvement in cryptocurrency discussions and events, I would assign a relatively high probability to P, indicating he might attend the event.\n\nFor not_P, since there is a reasonable chance he could be unavailable or choose not to attend, I would assign a lower probability, ensuring it complements P according to the consistency rules.\n\nThe para_P question, which is similar to P, should have a probability close to P since it essentially asks the same thing but in a different format. Therefore, I would estimate it similarly.\n\nRegarding Q, which deals with Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon, this question is more complex and speculative. Factors such as advancements in space travel, colonization efforts by SpaceX, and the timeline of human settlement would significantly influence this probability. Given the current technological limitations and timelines, I would assign a lower probability to Q.\n\nThe P_and_Q question combines both events, so its probability would be lower than either P or Q alone, as both conditions must be met simultaneously. The P_or_Q question would have a higher probability since it only requires one of the two events to occur.\n\nThe Q_and_not_P question would also have a low probability since it combines the likelihood of Mars colonization with Elon Musk not attending the conference, which might be less likely if we consider his interest in space exploration and technology.\n\nFinally, Q_given_P would reflect the conditional probability of Mars having a population of 10,000 given that Musk attends the conference. This could be influenced by the idea that Musk's attendance might correlate with increased interest in space exploration, so I would estimate it accordingly.\n\nOverall, I would ensure that all probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules, such as ensuring that P + not_P = 1 and that the combined probabilities for P_and_Q and P_or_Q respect the logical relationships defined by the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04126088187275112, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.02063044093637556, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28988551782622446, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, factors such as his schedule, public interest, and the nature of the event will influence this probability.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is high, not_P will be low, and vice versa.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance Elon Musk will attend)**: This is essentially the same event as P, so I would expect this to have a similar probability estimate. \n\n4. **Q (Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This question hinges on the feasibility of colonizing Mars compared to the Moon. Given current technological advancements and interest in Mars by organizations like SpaceX, there's a moderate probability that Mars may reach this population before the Moon.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Musk shows up and Mars has a population of 10,000)**: The likelihood of both events occurring simultaneously is generally lower than the individual probabilities of P and Q due to the independence of the events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Musk shows up or Mars has a population of 10,000)**: This is likely higher than both individual probabilities, as it encompasses either of the events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars has a population of 10,000 and Musk does not show up)**: This situation is plausible and can occur without any contradiction, thus providing a reasonable estimate.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (If Musk shows up, will Mars have a population of 10,000)**: This conditional probability will depend on the belief that Musk's presence may influence the likelihood of Mars colonization, potentially increasing the probability of Q if P is true.\n\nIn terms of consistency, I need to ensure that the relationships between these probabilities align with the defined consistency rules. For example, the sum of P and not_P must equal 1, and the probabilities of P_and_Q and P_or_Q must also adhere to their respective rules. Given the relationships, I will need to carefully evaluate and adjust the probabilities to ensure that they reflect these dependencies accurately.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.45,\nP_and_Q: 0.27,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.18,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.27 - 0.45 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.45 - 1, 0) <= 0.27 <= min(0.60, 0.45) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.45) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.45) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.18 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.27 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.45,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.18,\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "0c6ac27b-021e-41ac-8f5d-0d0a772a33e1", "title": "Will Iran not carry out a deadly attack within Israel before May 1, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves **Yes** if, following the date of this question's publication and before May 1, 2024, there are no credible reports indicating that an attack attributed to Iran and occurring within Israel's borders has led to the death of at least five individuals.", "resolution_date": "2024-05-01T17:53:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-10T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "timestamp": "2024-09-26T00:20:02.650728", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('4447f102-cbcc-4435-bc8f-512519cae8b4'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('51f26104-327b-4a01-848d-c9c19336ab6c'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('23f41f2c-ca54-4df1-8d70-e9b28175f06f'), title='Is there a chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('ea55ccbe-6cf9-4d9b-a712-ac0e02e40799'), title='Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nMars is often disussed as a target for mass colonization and eventual terraforming, notably by SpaceX.

Given Musk's history of attending significant conferences related to cryptocurrency, I would estimate a moderate probability of him showing up. \n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up)**: This is the complement of P and thus should be calculated as 1 - P. The relationship between P and not_P is direct and must always sum to 1. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially synonymous with P, as both questions ask about Musk's attendance. Therefore, P and para_P should have the same probability. \n\n4. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This question is more speculative and depends on advancements in space colonization. Given the current technological and logistical challenges, I would assign a lower probability to this event compared to P, but still a reasonable chance due to ongoing interest in Mars colonization. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Musk showing up and Mars having a population)**: This event requires both P and Q to occur simultaneously. The probability of this happening would be lower than either P or Q alone, as it is contingent on both events happening together.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Musk shows up or Mars has a population)**: This is more likely than P_and_Q, as it only requires one of the events to occur. The probability should reflect the likelihood of at least one of these two events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars has a population and Musk does not show up)**: This event also requires careful consideration of the relationships between Q and not_P. It can happen if Mars successfully establishes a population while Musk is absent from the conference. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Musk shows up, will Mars have a population)**: This conditional probability reflects how the occurrence of P may influence the likelihood of Q. It suggests that if Musk attends, it may somehow correlate with advancements in Mars colonization efforts, possibly due to SpaceX's involvement in both areas.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that my probability estimates respect the consistency rules provided, such as the relationship between P and not_P, the constraints on P_and_Q and P_or_Q, and the conditional relationships between Q and P. I will also consider the independence or dependence of these events when making my estimates.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.38 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.24,\nP_or_Q: 0.76,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.040821994520255034, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.020410997260127517, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28837490036423613, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This reflects a reasonable expectation based on Musk's history of attending high-profile events, particularly in the cryptocurrency space. The complementary probability (not_P) is thus 0.35, indicating a significant chance that he may not attend, which is plausible given his unpredictable schedule.\n\nFor the related question of whether there is a chance that Elon Musk will attend the conference (para_P), I have assigned the same probability of 0.65. This is because the definitions of P and para_P are effectively the same, both hinging on his attendance.\n\nThe question regarding Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does (Q) has been assigned a probability of 0.40. This reflects the ongoing discussions and plans regarding Mars colonization, particularly by SpaceX, but acknowledges the significant hurdles that remain.\n\nThe combined event of both Elon Musk showing up at the conference and Mars achieving a population of 10,000 (P_and_Q) has been assigned a probability of 0.30. This reflects the fact that while both events could happen, they are not guaranteed to occur simultaneously, hence the lower probability compared to the individual events.\n\nFor the event where either Elon Musk shows up at the conference or Mars achieves the population milestone (P_or_Q), I estimated a probability of 0.75. This is higher than the individual probabilities because it accounts for the likelihood of at least one of the events happening.\n\nThe event where Mars achieves the population milestone while Elon Musk does not show up (Q_and_not_P) is given a probability of 0.15, which reflects the lower likelihood of this specific combination occurring.\n\nLastly, the conditional probability of Mars achieving the population milestone given that Elon Musk shows up (Q_given_P) is estimated at 0.35. This reflects the potential that Musk's presence could influence developments regarding Mars colonization, but does not guarantee it.\n\nOverall, these estimates are interrelated, and I have ensured they adhere to the consistency rules. For example, the relationship between P and not_P is straightforward (P + not_P = 1). The probabilities for P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P are also aligned with the probabilities of P and Q, ensuring compliance with the rules regarding conjunctions and disjunctions.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.30 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.30 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.24,\nP_or_Q: 0.76,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16,\nQ_given_P: 0.32\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "22d9d8a8-0d59-418c-8ca7-338be632082b", "title": "Will Croatia fail to qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Croatia does not participate in a Semi-final or is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as not having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Given his past involvement in the cryptocurrency space, I estimate a moderate to high probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If I predict P to be high, not_P will naturally be lower. \n\n3. **para_P (Chance that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is closely related to P, and since they refer to the same event, I expect their probabilities to be aligned or very similar.\n\n4. **Q (Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This event is speculative and depends on advancements in space colonization. Given current technological and logistical challenges, I estimate a lower probability for this event, but it could change with significant investments and breakthroughs in space travel.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This probability will be influenced by the individual probabilities of P and Q. If both are independently assessed as likely, the joint probability will reflect that. However, if either event is deemed unlikely, it will lower this joint probability.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses the occurrence of at least one of the two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars has a population of 10,000 before the Moon, and Musk does not show up)**: This event combines the likelihood of Q occurring with the opposite of P. The relationship between these probabilities needs careful consideration, as the occurrence of one does not directly influence the other.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (If Musk shows up, will Mars have a population of 10,000 before the Moon)?**: This conditional probability assesses how the occurrence of P might influence the likelihood of Q. It may be reasonable to assume that if Musk attends, it could increase interest and investment in Mars colonization, potentially raising the probability of Q.\n\nIn summary, while P and Q are somewhat independent, the relationships between them through the combined and conditional probabilities will require careful balancing to ensure consistency. I will ensure that all probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.16,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.74 + 0.16 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.16 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.74 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.16 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06471682202218454, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03235841101109227, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.36524578353570125, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his past involvement with cryptocurrency and technology, I estimate a relatively high probability of 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of Elon Musk attending)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would estimate this at 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This is a more speculative question. Given current advancements in space travel and colonization plans by companies like SpaceX, I would assign a moderate probability of 0.40.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: Since both events are somewhat independent, I would calculate this as the product of their probabilities, resulting in 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. So, 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs and P does not)**: This would be calculated as Q * not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This is a conditional probability. If we assume that Musk's attendance at the conference might influence the perception of Mars colonization, I would estimate this at a slightly higher probability, say 0.45.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities are interrelated, and I have made adjustments to ensure that they comply with the consistency rules provided. I believe these estimates reflect a reasonable assessment of the likelihood of each event occurring.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "22ab7762-cccc-4d2f-8be8-0beef0590522", "title": "Will USA not top the Olympic Medal Table at Paris 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve positively if any team achieves a higher or equal ranking to the United States Olympic Team at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

However, there are uncertainties regarding his schedule and commitments.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up)**: This probability is naturally the complement of P, estimated at 0.35. Given the high-profile nature of the event, I believe that there is still a significant chance he might not attend.\n\n3. **para_P (Chance of attendance)**: This is aligned with P, as it essentially asks the same question regarding Musk's attendance, hence I set it equal to P at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Mars population vs. Moon)**: I assigned a probability of 0.40 to this question, considering the ongoing discussions about Mars colonization, particularly by SpaceX, and the challenges that still lie ahead.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both occur)**: The probability of both Musk attending and Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 is estimated at 0.26. This is a product of both events being somewhat independent, but with a lower likelihood due to the uncertainty of both events occurring simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either occurs)**: Given that either event happening is more likely than both failing, I estimated this at 0.79, which reflects the higher chance that at least one of these events will indeed occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars population and Musk not attending)**: I estimated this at 0.14, considering the likelihood of Mars colonization progressing while Musk might not attend the conference.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Mars population given Musk attends)**: This is estimated at 0.38, suggesting that if Musk does attend, it may somewhat influence the perception or actions toward Mars colonization, although not significantly.\n\nAll these estimates were made with the understanding that they must adhere to the consistency rules provided. I will now check if the estimates align with those rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.26,\nP_or_Q: 0.79,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.38 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.78,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09431067947124139, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047155339735620694, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44426165831931935, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
