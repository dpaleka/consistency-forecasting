Given the prominence of Donald Trump and the possibility of other family members running, I estimate a moderate probability of this event occurring. I might assign a probability of around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary event of P. If I estimate P to be 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, as they must sum to 1.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Since I believe there is a reasonable chance of this happening, I would assign a probability similar to P, around 0.65.\n\n4. **Q**: This question concerns global warming, specifically if there will be at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100. Given the current trends in climate data and projections from scientists, I would assign a higher probability, perhaps around 0.75, reflecting a strong consensus on this issue.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question requires both P and Q to be true. If I estimate P at 0.65 and Q at 0.75, I might estimate P_and_Q using the formula for independent events. However, since these events are not strictly independent, I would consider a lower value, perhaps around 0.50, as both events can influence each other.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This question asks if either P or Q occurs. Given the probabilities of P and Q, I would calculate this using the formula for the union of two events, which would likely yield a value around 0.85.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question asks if Q occurs while not_P also occurs. Since not_P is the opposite of P, I would expect this probability to be lower. I might estimate this at around 0.20, reflecting the probability of global warming occurring without a Trump family member as the nominee.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability asks if Q occurs given that P is true. Since P being true does not necessarily affect the likelihood of Q, I might estimate this at around 0.75, similar to the estimate for Q.\n\nIn summary, my estimates would be as follows:\n- P: 0.65\n- not_P: 0.35\n- para_P: 0.65\n- Q: 0.75\n- P_and_Q: 0.50\n- P_or_Q: 0.85\n- Q_and_not_P: 0.20\n- Q_given_P: 0.75\n\nThese estimates should obey the consistency rules, and I will check them against the provided rules to ensure they are valid.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "not_P": {"id": "b77d44e4-8b0c-487f-8d07-8f080772111b", "title": "Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\nDonald Trump\nDonald Trump Jr.\nEric Trump\nIvanka Trump\nTiffany Trump\nMelania Trump\nBarron Trump\n", "resolution_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.6, "elicitation_metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-11T01:08:11.800952", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('ecf4e11e-ba1f-4c72-a7ec-8806fdef2364'), title='Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d08f71f6-a0c0-42c8-9fd6-94b7f979bee2'), title='Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('b9658f72-ae17-4fc8-81ed-acdd1e8127b5'), title='Is it possible that a member of the Trump family will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis will be resolved as Yes if any of the following individuals become the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c5e1dc5a-154c-42b1-9b51-35a784d019ba'), title='Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 \u02daC greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

Each question has a binary resolution, and we must ensure that our probability estimates obey the consistency rules provided. \n\n1. **P (Trump Family Nominee)**: I estimate a relatively high probability for this event, as Donald Trump has a strong following within the Republican Party, and there is a chance that one of his family members could be nominated. Factors such as the political landscape and public opinion will influence this probability.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the complementary event to P. Given the high probability assigned to P, this probability will be correspondingly low. \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This probability should align closely with P, as it essentially asks if it is possible for a family member to be nominated. Therefore, I expect this value to be similar to P.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is influenced by scientific consensus and current climate trends. Given the urgency of climate change, I would assign a moderate to high probability to this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: This probability represents the intersection of P and Q. It will be lower than either P or Q alone, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both events occurring simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the possibility of either event occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming and No Trump Nominee)**: This probability reflects the scenario where global warming occurs, but no Trump family member is nominated. This is likely to be lower than Q, as it combines the uncertainty of both events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming given Trump Nominee)**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming occurring if a Trump family member is the nominee. The relationship between these two events may not be directly correlated, but it could reflect political decisions impacting climate policies.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probability estimates I provide adhere to the consistency rules, particularly the relationships between the events. For instance, P and not_P must sum to 1, and the calculations for P_and_Q and P_or_Q must obey the rules for combined probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.86 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.86 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.86 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.60 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.36\nP_or_Q: 0.84\nQ_and_not_P: 0.24\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}
