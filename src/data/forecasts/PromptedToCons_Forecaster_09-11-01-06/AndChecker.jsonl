Given the prominence of the Trump family in current politics, I estimate a probability of 0.65 for this event occurring. This reflects the possibility that a family member, likely Donald Trump, could secure the nomination, considering his previous candidacy and influence.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complement of P. Therefore, if P is estimated at 0.65, not_P should be 1 - 0.65 = 0.35. This aligns with the consistency rule that states not_P = 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question asks if it is possible for a member of the Trump family to secure the nomination. Given that P is 0.65, it is reasonable to set para_P also at 0.65, as it reflects the same likelihood of a family member being nominated.\n\n4. **Q**: The question here is about global warming, specifically whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100. This is a more uncertain prediction due to the complexities of climate change. I estimate this probability at 0.70, considering current trends in climate data and predictions from scientific sources.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question combines the outcomes of P and Q. To estimate this, I will use the minimum of the probabilities of P and Q, given that both events must occur. Thus, I estimate P_and_Q at 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: For this question, I will apply the rule of addition for probabilities, accounting for the overlap of P and Q. This can be calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question asks if Q occurs while not_P also occurs. Since not_P is the complement of P, I estimate this probability based on the likelihood of Q occurring when P does not. Given that Q is more likely, I estimate Q_and_not_P at 0.70 * 0.35 = 0.245.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This is a conditional probability. Given that P occurs, I estimate the likelihood of Q occurring as similar to Q itself, so I set Q_given_P at 0.70.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these probabilities are interconnected. P and not_P are complementary, para_P reflects the same likelihood as P, and the calculations for P_and_Q and P_or_Q follow the rules of probability addition and multiplication. I will now check these estimates against the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.46\nP_or_Q: 0.89\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.89 + 0.46 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.89 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.89 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.46\nP_or_Q: 0.89\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q": {"id": "b0876333-7da3-43bb-877b-4a9f7a85f75b", "title": "Will we find life on Mars by 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions.\nIf this has not happened before January 1, 2050, this question will resolve as No\n", "resolution_date": "2050-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.6, "elicitation_metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-11T01:09:31.562896", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('ecf4e11e-ba1f-4c72-a7ec-8806fdef2364'), title='Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d08f71f6-a0c0-42c8-9fd6-94b7f979bee2'), title='Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('b9658f72-ae17-4fc8-81ed-acdd1e8127b5'), title='Is it possible that a member of the Trump family will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis will be resolved as Yes if any of the following individuals become the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c5e1dc5a-154c-42b1-9b51-35a784d019ba'), title='Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 \u02daC greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

Given the prominence of Donald Trump and the potential candidacy of other family members, I estimate this probability at a moderate level, possibly around 0.60.\n\n**not_P**: This is the complementary event to P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. This relationship is straightforward and follows the negation rule.\n\n**para_P**: This question is similar to P but framed as a possibility rather than a certainty. Given that the same candidates are involved, the probability should be equal to P, so I estimate this at 0.60 as well.\n\n**Q**: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is influenced by scientific consensus and climate models. Given the current trajectory of climate change, I estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.75.\n\n**P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to be true. The probability would be the product of the individual probabilities, but it cannot exceed the minimum of P and Q. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.75, I estimate this at around 0.45.\n\n**P_or_Q**: This event resolves positively if either P or Q occurs. The maximum of P and Q must be considered, so I estimate this probability at around 0.85.\n\n**Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to be true while P is false. The probability of this happening would depend on the likelihood of global warming occurring without a Trump family member being the nominee. I estimate this at around 0.30.\n\n**Q_given_P**: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of warming may not change significantly, so I would estimate this around 0.70.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that all these estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.

This is based on the current political landscape and the prominence of the Trump family in Republican politics. \n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: The probability of no member of the Trump family being the nominee is the complement of P. If P is moderately high, then not_P must be lower, reflecting that while there is a chance for other candidates, the Trump family remains a strong contender.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This probability should be similar to P since it reflects the same underlying question but framed in terms of possibility rather than certainty. It should not exceed P.\n\n**Q (Global Warming)**: The likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is estimated based on current climate models and trends. Given the current trajectory of climate change, this probability is relatively high.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Conditions)**: The probability that both a Trump family member is the nominee and that there will be significant global warming is expected to be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be true simultaneously. \n\n**P_or_Q (Either Condition)**: The probability of either a Trump family member being the nominee or significant global warming occurring should be higher than P_and_Q but should still respect the individual probabilities of P and Q. \n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global Warming with No Trump Nominee)**: This probability reflects a scenario where global warming occurs without a Trump family member being the nominee. This could be estimated based on the independence of the two events, but it should be lower than Q due to the additional condition of not_P.\n\n**Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: The probability of global warming given that a Trump family member is the nominee should reflect the same likelihood of global warming, as the two events can be considered independent in this context. \n\nOverall, the predictions for P, Q, and their combinations should respect the consistency rules provided. For example, the relationship between P and not_P must hold true, and the probabilities for P_and_Q and P_or_Q must be calculated correctly to ensure that they do not exceed their respective limits based on the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.70 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
