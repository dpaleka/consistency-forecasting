Given the historical context and current political climate, I estimate this probability to be relatively high, around **0.65**.\n\n**not_P (No Trump nominee):** This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be **0.35**. This reflects the possibility that none of the Trump family members will secure the nomination, which is plausible given the competitive nature of the Republican primaries.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of Trump nominee):** Since para_P is essentially asking if there is any chance at all of a Trump family member winning the nomination, it should be equal to P, so I will set it at **0.65** as well.\n\n**Q (Global warming):** Estimating whether there will be at least 2\u00b0C of global warming by 2100 involves scientific predictions and climate models. Given the current trajectory of climate change and the increasing global temperatures, I estimate this probability to be **0.75**.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events):** This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be true. I estimate this to be **0.50**, considering the independent nature of the two events.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event):** This probability must account for the overlap between P and Q. Using the formula for the union of two probabilities, I will estimate this at **0.85**, reflecting the high likelihood of at least one of the two events occurring.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global warming and no Trump nominee):** This probability reflects the scenario where global warming occurs, but no Trump family member is nominated. Given the independence of these events, I estimate this to be around **0.20**.\n\n**Q_given_P (Global warming given Trump nominee):** This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of global warming occurring if a Trump family member is the nominee. I will estimate this to be **0.70**, as the political situation may not significantly alter climate predictions.\n\nOverall, the predictions are interrelated, with the events related to the Trump family\u2019s nomination being somewhat independent of the global warming scenario. I will ensure that the probabilities obey the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q": {"id": "60c5393d-c803-4aa0-85b9-e35a32159669", "title": "Will gravitational waves from the merger of supermassive black holes be detected by November 30, 2027?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as positive if by November 30, 2027, a peer-reviewed publication announces the results of such an event.

This is based on Donald Trump's significant influence and the possibility of one of his children stepping into a prominent role.\n\n2. **not_P (Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This is the complementary event to P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would logically be 0.35 (1 - P).\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that a member of the Trump family will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This question is similar to P, and I would assign it the same probability of 0.65, as it reflects the same underlying uncertainties and possibilities.\n\n4. **Q (Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: Given the current trends in climate science and the increasing evidence of global warming, I estimate a high probability of 0.75 that this threshold will be crossed by 2100.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee and there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: The probability of both events occurring is less than either event occurring individually, so I estimate this at 0.50, considering that while both events are plausible, they are not necessarily dependent on one another.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee or there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: This probability should be higher than either individual event, so I estimate it at 0.85, as it reflects the likelihood of at least one of these significant events occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, and no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee?)**: This combines two independent events, and I estimate it at 0.20, reflecting a scenario where climate change occurs but the Trump family does not play a role in the nomination.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee, will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?)**: This conditional probability should reflect the likelihood of global warming occurring irrespective of the nomination, so I estimate it at 0.75, consistent with the earlier estimate for Q.\n\nIn summary, I consider the relationships between these probabilities, ensuring they comply with the consistency rules provided. The estimates for P and Q are based on current political and scientific trends, while the combined and conditional probabilities reflect the logical relationships between these events.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_given_Q": {"id": "297c8efb-87e1-4c70-8037-59ebbcdcad58", "title": "Conditional on detecting gravitational waves from the merger of supermassive black holes by November 30, 2027, will we detect a message originating from Luyten's Star before 2046?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for the condition:\nThis question will resolve as positive if by November 30, 2027, a peer-reviewed publication announces the results of such an event.

This reflects the current political climate and the prominence of Donald Trump and his family in the Republican party. Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee (not_P) is therefore 0.35, as these two outcomes are mutually exclusive.\n\nRegarding the question of whether it is possible for a member of the Trump family to secure the Republican nomination (para_P), I maintain the same probability of 0.65, as it aligns with P.\n\nFor the question about global warming (Q), I estimate a probability of 0.55, considering the ongoing climate discussions and scientific predictions about temperature rise. This leads to a not_Q probability of 0.45.\n\nThe joint probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and there being at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 (P_and_Q) is estimated at 0.35. This is a conservative estimate, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding both political and environmental outcomes.\n\nThe probability of either event occurring (P_or_Q) is estimated at 0.75, as these events are not entirely dependent on each other, and I expect at least one of them to happen.\n\nFor the scenario where global warming occurs but no Trump family member is the nominee (Q_and_not_P), I estimate a probability of 0.20, reflecting a reasonable likelihood of climate change occurring without Trump involvement.\n\nFinally, for the conditional probability of global warming given that a Trump family member is the nominee (Q_given_P), I estimate this at 0.50, reflecting the belief that political dynamics can influence environmental policies and outcomes.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.55\nP_and_Q: 0.35\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 -

I estimate this at 0.85, indicating a high likelihood that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming with No Trump Nominee)**: This probability is estimated at 0.25, indicating a scenario where global warming occurs without a Trump family member being the nominee.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: This conditional probability is estimated at 0.60, suggesting that if a Trump family member is the nominee, the likelihood of global warming reaching the 2\u02daC threshold remains significant.\n\n### Consistency and Relationships:\n- The relationship between P and not_P is straightforward, with not_P being the complement of P.\n- P and Q are not directly dependent but may influence each other in the broader political context.\n- The estimates for P_and_Q and P_or_Q must ensure they adhere to the rules of probability, particularly regarding their bounds.\n- The conditional probabilities (Q_given_P) must accurately reflect the relationship between the events, ensuring they are consistent with the unconditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
