The key events are: \n\n1. **P**: A member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. Given Donald Trump's prominence and the potential candidacy of other family members, I estimate this probability to be relatively high. \n\n2. **not_P**: This represents the event of no member of the Trump family being the nominee. Since I expect at least one family member to run, this probability will be lower than P.\n\n3. **para_P**: This event is about the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination. It is closely related to P, and since P is high, para_P will also be high.\n\n4. **Q**: The event of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100. This is a significant concern, and based on current climate trends, I estimate this probability to be moderate.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This combines the two events of a Trump family member being the nominee and global warming occurring. This probability will be lower than P and Q individually, as it requires both events to happen simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event represents the occurrence of either P or Q. Given that both events have non-negligible probabilities, this will be higher than either P or Q alone.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event indicates that there will be global warming, but no Trump family member will be the nominee. This is plausible, so I will assign it a moderate probability.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional event examines the likelihood of global warming occurring if a Trump family member is the nominee. The expectation is that this does not significantly change the probability of global warming, so it should be similar to Q.\n\nIn terms of consistency, the relationship between P and not_P is straightforward: they should sum to 1. The relationship between P, Q, and their combinations will also need to adhere to the rules outlined in the consistency guidelines.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.86 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.86 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.86 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.60 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
