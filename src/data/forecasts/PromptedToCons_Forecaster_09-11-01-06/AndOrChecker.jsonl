Given the significant influence and visibility of the Trump family, I estimate a moderate to high probability that one of them will secure the nomination. \n\nFor not_P, which states that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee, I assess this as the complement of P. Thus, if I estimate P at a certain probability, not_P will be the remaining probability, which logically must sum to 1 with P.\n\nThe question para_P is similar to P, as it asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the same reasoning, I would assign a probability that reflects the likelihood of the scenario presented in P.\n\nFor Q, concerning the likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, I would rely on scientific consensus and current climate models, which suggest a significant probability of this occurring if current trends continue. This question is independent of the Trump family nomination question, as it pertains to environmental science rather than political dynamics.\n\nP_and_Q examines both conditions occurring simultaneously. The probability for this would be calculated based on the individual probabilities of P and Q, considering their independence or correlation. \n\nP_or_Q evaluates the likelihood that at least one of the two scenarios (Trump family nominee or significant global warming) will occur. This probability is typically higher than either individual probability, as it considers both events. \n\nQ_and_not_P evaluates if there will be significant warming while no Trump family member is nominated. This requires careful consideration of the probabilities of both events happening together. \n\nFinally, Q_given_P looks at the probability of global warming occurring, given that a Trump family member is the nominee. This is a conditional probability that may not be independent, as political decisions can influence environmental policies. \n\nIn summary, my estimates will be based on the interplay between these events, their independence, and the current context surrounding them. I will ensure that the probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q": {"id": "4a8d03df-23a5-4755-a9c2-61ef546e0c60", "title": "Will we find life on Mars by 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions.\nIf this has not happened before January 1, 2050, this question will resolve as No\n", "resolution_date": "2050-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.65, "elicitation_metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-11T01:14:03.038502", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('ecf4e11e-ba1f-4c72-a7ec-8806fdef2364'), title='Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d08f71f6-a0c0-42c8-9fd6-94b7f979bee2'), title='Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('b9658f72-ae17-4fc8-81ed-acdd1e8127b5'), title='Is it possible that a member of the Trump family will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis will be resolved as Yes if any of the following individuals become the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c5e1dc5a-154c-42b1-9b51-35a784d019ba'), title='Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively if, by January 1, 2100, there has been a period of at least 5 consecutive years in which the average global temperature in each year was at least 2.0 \u02daC greater than the average global temperature in 1880.\\n(Note that 1880 isn't exactly pre-industrial, but earlier data is highly unreliable, and there should really not have been much warming by then.)\\nData for resolution shall come from NASA, if possible.

Given the prominence of the Trump family in Republican politics, I estimate this probability to be relatively high.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary event to P. If the probability of P is high, then not_P must be correspondingly low. This relationship is straightforward and follows the rule that P + not_P = 1.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P but framed in a different way. If P is true, then para_P is also true, meaning the probability should be aligned with P.\n\n4. **Q**: The likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 depends on current climate trends, policies, and scientific predictions. Given the trajectory of climate change and current data, I estimate a moderate probability for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to be true. The probability of this happening will be less than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q, as it is a conjunction of both.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event is true if either P or Q is true. The probability should be higher than either individual probability but less than or equal to 1.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event is true if Q is true while P is false. This requires careful consideration of the independence of these events. If Q is likely, but P is not, this probability could be significant.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q occurring given that P is true. This likelihood could be influenced by the political landscape and climate policies that may be enacted if a Trump family member is in a position of power.\n\nAll these probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules provided. For instance, the relationship between P and not_P must always sum to 1, and the probabilities of conjunctions and disjunctions must fall within the defined ranges. By ensuring that these estimates are coherent and consistent with each other, I can provide a robust forecast of these events.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "54befa15-026d-4235-960b-b1c9cabf59ad", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) humanity discovers extraterrestrial life on Europa before 2045 and (b) unambiguous evidence of life on Mars is found before 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:\n(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045, and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

This is based on the current political climate, Trump's influence within the party, and potential candidacy of family members.\n   - **Probability Estimate**: 0.60\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary event of P. If P has a probability of 0.60, then not_P must be 0.40, reflecting the possibility that no Trump family member will be the nominee.\n   - **Probability Estimate**: 0.40\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P and should have the same probability since it inquires about the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination. Thus, it will also be set to 0.60.\n   - **Probability Estimate**: 0.60\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The probability of there being at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is influenced by scientific consensus and current trends in climate change. I estimate this probability to be relatively high, given the urgency of climate issues.\n   - **Probability Estimate**: 0.75\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This represents the joint probability that both events occur. Given that both events have moderate to high probabilities, I estimate this to be a bit lower than the individual probabilities, reflecting the fact that while both are plausible, they are not guaranteed to happen together. I estimate this to be around 0.45.\n   - **Probability Estimate**: 0.45\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This is the probability that at least one of the events occurs. Since both P and Q are reasonably likely, I expect this to be higher than either individual probability. I estimate this to be around 0.85.\n   - **Probability Estimate**: 0.85\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This represents the scenario where global warming occurs, but no Trump family member is the nominee. Since global warming is a significant concern and the Trump family\u2019s candidacy is uncertain, I estimate this to be around 0.30.\n   - **Probability Estimate**: 0.30\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This is the conditional probability that global warming occurs given that a Trump family member is the nominee. I believe this probability is influenced by the political stance on climate change, which may vary based on who the nominee is. I estimate this to be around 0.70.\n   - **Probability Estimate**: 0.70\n\nOverall, I am ensuring that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules outlined. For instance, P and not_P must sum to 1, and the relationships between probabilities in the and/or conditions must also hold true.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "9c3bb0ba-3d20-4974-b35c-f6cfabc2b55f", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Europa be the first place humanity will discover extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045?

Since both events need to occur, this probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, but still positive if both are plausible.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This is the probability that at least one of P or Q occurs. It will be higher than both P and Q since it includes scenarios where either event can occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming with No Trump Nominee)**: This question combines Q with the negation of P. The probability will depend on how likely global warming is versus the likelihood of a Trump family member being the nominee. If Q is high and P is low, this probability can be moderate.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: This conditional probability asks for the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. If a Trump family member is the nominee, it might not significantly change the likelihood of global warming, so I will estimate this probability based on the assumption that the two events are somewhat independent.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: P and Q are not directly dependent on each other, as one is political and the other is environmental. However, they can influence public perception and policy decisions. For instance, if a Trump family member becomes the nominee, it may affect climate policies, which in turn could impact the likelihood of Q. Therefore, while they are independent, they are also interconnected in the broader context of governance and public policy.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
