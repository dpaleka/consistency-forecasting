For the purpose of this question, a 'referendum' refers to a direct vote by the electorate on a particular proposal, in this case regarding abortion rights. If no such referendum occurs or is completed by the specified date, the question resolves as NO. Note that merely scheduling a referendum is not sufficient for a YES resolution; the actual vote must take place within the specified timeframe.
