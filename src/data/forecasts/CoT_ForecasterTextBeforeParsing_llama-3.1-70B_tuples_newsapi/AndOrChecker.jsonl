The labor market has been a strong sector, with low unemployment rates. However, inflation and global economic uncertainty could impact job stability. 2. **Historical Context**: Historically, jobless claims have been a reliable indicator of the labor market's health. A significant and sustained increase in claims usually signals economic stress or a recession. However, the number of 275,000 as a threshold is somewhat arbitrary and may not necessarily indicate a severe economic downturn but rather a slowdown or stabilization in the labor market. 3. **Predictive Indicators**: Several indicators can predict potential increases in jobless claims, such as GDP growth rates, consumer spending, and business confidence surveys. A decline in these indicators could suggest a higher likelihood of increased jobless claims. 4. **Timeframe**: The question specifies a timeframe of 'by August 2024,' which gives a considerable window for economic conditions to change. Economic forecasts are notoriously difficult, especially over shorter timeframes, but having several months allows for various economic scenarios to play out. Considering these factors, the probability of U.S. weekly jobless claims exceeding 275,000 for four consecutive weeks by August 2024 seems plausible but not highly likely, given the current strength of the labor market.

Current Political Climate: As of my last update in April 2023, the political climate in the United States is highly polarized, with abortion rights being a contentious issue. The overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 by the U.S. Supreme Court has led to increased activism and political efforts at the state level to both restrict and protect abortion rights. Indiana, having a Republican-dominated legislature, has been among the states that have moved to restrict abortion access. 2. Legislative Landscape in Indiana: Given Indiana's legislative makeup and recent actions to restrict abortion, it might seem less likely for the state to conduct a referendum aimed at protecting abortion rights. However, public opinion and activism can influence political decisions, and there could be a push from advocacy groups and citizens for such a referendum. 3.

Historical Context: Land O'Frost has had previous recalls due to listeria contamination. In 2017, the company recalled over 3,000 pounds of its deli meats due to potential listeria contamination. This history suggests that the company is not immune to listeria outbreaks and has taken action in the past to address such issues. 2. Industry Trends: Listeria outbreaks are not uncommon in the meat industry. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), listeria outbreaks can occur in various food products, including deli meats. Given the frequency of such outbreaks in the industry, it's plausible that Land O'Frost could face a similar issue. 3. Regulatory Environment: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC closely monitor food safety, including listeria outbreaks. If a listeria outbreak were to occur, these agencies would likely prompt or require a recall if necessary. The regulatory environment is conducive to recalls in the event of a listeria outbreak. 4. Company Practices: While the question does not provide specific information on Land O'Frost's current practices regarding food safety and listeria prevention, companies in the industry generally adhere to strict guidelines to minimize the risk of contamination. However, despite best practices, outbreaks can still occur due to various factors. 5. Time Frame: The question specifies a recall by August 2024. Given the timeframe, there's ample opportunity for an outbreak to occur and be identified, leading to a recall. Considering these factors, while there's no guarantee of a listeria outbreak or subsequent recall, the historical context, industry trends, and regulatory environment suggest that it's plausible.

Based on historical data, listeria outbreaks and recalls are relatively rare in the deli meat industry. However, when they do occur, they can be severe and widespread. Recent market conditions suggest that listeria is still a concern in the food supply chain, with occasional outbreaks and recalls reported. Regarding company-specific factors, both Land O'Frost and Boar's Head have a generally good safety track record, but like any food company, they are not immune to the risk of contamination. A review of their recall history shows that they have issued recalls in the past, but not recently.

Event (a): Google's AI assistant reported for spreading election misinformation by August 2024. The likelihood of this event depends on several factors, including the extent to which Google's AI assistant is used during the election period, the effectiveness of Google's content moderation and fact-checking efforts, and the presence of malicious actors attempting to spread misinformation through the AI assistant. Given the increasing use of AI-powered tools in elections and the ongoing challenges of combating misinformation, it's plausible that there could be instances where Google's AI assistant is used to spread election misinformation. However, it's also likely that Google will take steps to mitigate this risk, and the question requires credible reports from multiple sources, which may not necessarily materialize.

Given the CMA's past activity in this area, I estimate the probability of this event as 0.6. Combined probability: To estimate the combined probability of both events occurring, we need to assume that they are independent (i.e., the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other). Under this assumption, we can multiply the individual probabilities: Combined probability = Probability of event (a) \u00d7 Probability of event (b) = 0.4 \u00d7 0.6 = 0.24.

While both countries have expressed interest in joining BRICS, there is no clear indication that they have made significant progress in their membership bids. Mexico has been actively seeking to diversify its trade relationships and has been exploring cooperation with BRICS countries, but it is unclear whether this will lead to full membership. The Philippines, on the other hand, has been strengthening its ties with China, a key member of BRICS, but its membership bid is still in its early stages.

Current Dispute and Motivation: The fact that there is an ongoing dispute indicates that there are unresolved issues between Union Pacific and the train engineers' union. The motivation to resolve these issues, especially concerning safety protocols, is likely high for both parties. Safety is a critical aspect of the rail industry, and addressing concerns can improve working conditions, reduce accidents, and enhance public trust. 2. Negotiation Dynamics: Labor negotiations can be complex and often involve significant back-and-forth. However, the specificity of the issue (safety protocols for engineers) suggests a focused area of negotiation, which might streamline discussions compared to broader, more general labor disputes. 3. Public and Regulatory Pressure: The rail industry is heavily regulated and subject to public scrutiny. Incidents or disputes related to safety can draw significant media attention and regulatory interest. This external pressure can incentivize both parties to reach an agreement to demonstrate their commitment to safety. 4. Timeframe: The question specifies a resolution by August 2024, which provides a relatively short but feasible timeframe for negotiations. Given the importance of safety and the potential for ongoing discussions, this timeframe seems sufficient for reaching an agreement if both parties are committed. 5. Precedent and Industry Norms: While specific outcomes can vary, the rail industry has a history of labor agreements addressing safety and working conditions. This precedent suggests that reaching such agreements is feasible and aligns with industry norms.

Amtrak has an interest in maintaining good relations with its workforce and addressing quality of life concerns. Implementing such a system could be a proactive step to improve working conditions and might be feasible within the given timeframe, especially if it's seen as a way to preempt or resolve potential disputes.

Event (a) - Harvard University fully covering tuition for medical students from lower-income families: Harvard University has a history of implementing generous financial aid policies. In 2018, it announced that it would provide free tuition to students from families earning less than $65,000 annually. Given this precedent, it's plausible that Harvard might expand its financial aid policy to cover tuition for medical students from families earning less than $100,000 annually. However, there are a few factors to consider: 1. Cost: Expanding financial aid to cover tuition for medical students would require significant funding. Harvard would need to ensure it has the necessary resources to support such a policy. 2. Administrative processes: Implementing a new financial aid policy would require approval from the university's administration, faculty, and board of trustees. This process can be time-consuming and may not be completed by July 2024. 3. Competing priorities: Harvard may have other priorities, such as addressing the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the university or focusing on other initiatives. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of Harvard implementing a policy to fully cover tuition for medical students from lower-income families by July 2024 as 0.4 (40%). Event (b) - Illinois holding a referendum on healthcare funding: The likelihood of Illinois holding a referendum on healthcare funding by July 2024 depends on various political and legislative factors: 1. Legislative process: A referendum would require a legislative proposal to be introduced, debated, and passed by the Illinois General Assembly. This process can be unpredictable and may not be completed by July 2024. 2. Political priorities: The Illinois state government may have other pressing issues to address, such as budget negotiations, education reform, or infrastructure development, which could take priority over a healthcare funding referendum. 3. Public support: A referendum would require sufficient public support and advocacy to move forward. If there is limited public interest or opposition, the referendum may not materialize. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Illinois holding a referendum on healthcare funding by July 2024 as 0.3 (30%). Combined probability: To calculate the combined probability of both events occurring, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.4 (Harvard implementing a policy to fully cover tuition for medical students) \u00d7 0.3 (Illinois holding a referendum on healthcare funding) = 0.12 (12%). Reasoning: Both events have uncertain probabilities, and their combined likelihood is lower due to the complexity and challenges involved in implementing a new financial aid policy at Harvard and holding a referendum in Illinois.

This trend is likely to continue as AI technologies advance and become more integral to business operations and customer experiences. 2. Adobe's Business Model and Recent Activities: Adobe has been investing heavily in AI research and development, integrating AI capabilities into its Creative Cloud suite and other products. This suggests a strategic focus on AI, which could necessitate an increase in AI-related workforce to support these initiatives. 3. Competition and Market Pressure: The software and tech industry is highly competitive, with companies constantly looking to innovate and stay ahead. Given Adobe's position as a leader in creative software, it's plausible that the company would seek to expand its AI capabilities to maintain market share and competitiveness. 4. Workforce Expansion Trends: Many tech companies have been expanding their workforces in AI and related fields. While this does not directly predict Adobe's actions, it sets a context where such an announcement would not be unusual. 5.

First, let's consider Texas. In recent years, Texas has been at the forefront of abortion restrictions, with the passage of Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) in 2021, which banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Given this trend, it's plausible that Texas might enact new regulations that impose stricter requirements on abortion providers. However, it's worth noting that the Texas legislative session typically runs from January to May, and any new laws or regulations would need to be enacted and confirmed by official state legislative documentation or reported by reputable news sources by July 2024. Regarding Alabama, the state has also been active in restricting abortion access. In 2019, Alabama passed a near-total abortion ban, which was later blocked by a federal court. While there have been efforts to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, it's unclear whether a referendum would be held by July 2024. Alabama's legislative session typically runs from February to April, and any referendum would need to be officially announced and completed by the resolution date. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of either Texas enacting new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers or Alabama holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024 as follows: Probability: 0.65. This probability reflects my assessment that while both Texas and Alabama have been active in restricting abortion access, the likelihood of new regulations or a referendum being enacted or held by July 2024 is uncertain.

Current Political Climate: New York has been at the forefront of climate change policy initiatives. The state has set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and has implemented various policies to achieve these goals. Given this context, it's plausible that the state might consider a referendum to further solidify or expand its climate policies. 2. Legislative and Executive Support: The success of a referendum often depends on the support of both the legislative and executive branches of the state government. New York's government has shown a commitment to addressing climate change, which could indicate a willingness to support a referendum. 3. Public Opinion and Activism: Public opinion in New York tends to favor strong action on climate change. If there is significant public demand for a referendum, coupled with activism pushing for such a measure, it could influence the state's decision to hold one. 4. Timeframe: The timeframe for organizing and executing a referendum by August 2024 is relatively short. This could be a limiting factor, as it requires swift action from the state's legislative and executive bodies to initiate the process. 5.

The question resolves YES if either the average rate on a 15-year mortgage exceeds 5.5% by August 2024 or PepsiCo reports increased North American demand for its Cracker Jack brand by July 2024. 1. Mortgage Rate Exceeding 5.5% by August 2024: Historical Context: Mortgage rates have fluctuated significantly in recent years, influenced by monetary policy, economic growth, and inflation. As of my last update, rates have been rising due to inflation concerns and monetary tightening. Forecasting Mortgage Rates: Predicting mortgage rates involves understanding future economic conditions, inflation expectations, and the actions of central banks. Given the current economic environment and the trend of increasing rates, there's a plausible scenario where the 15-year mortgage rate could exceed 5.5% by August 2024, especially if economic growth remains strong or inflation pressures persist. Probability Assessment: Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability of the average 15-year mortgage rate exceeding 5.5% by August 2024 as moderate to high, around 0.6. This reflects the uncertainty in economic forecasting but acknowledges the current trend and potential for further rate increases. 2. PepsiCo Reporting Increased Demand for Cracker Jack by July 2024: Market and Product Considerations: The demand for specific snack foods like Cracker Jack can be influenced by consumer preferences, marketing efforts, and broader economic conditions. While there's always potential for growth, predicting the demand for a specific product can be challenging without specific market data or company insights. Probability Assessment: Without recent data on Cracker Jack sales trends or PepsiCo's marketing strategies, it's difficult to accurately predict an increase in demand. However, considering the competitive nature of the snack food market and the potential for targeted marketing efforts, a moderate probability seems reasonable. I would estimate this probability as 0.45, reflecting the uncertainty and the need for specific company actions or market shifts to drive increased demand. Combined Probability: Given these probabilities, the overall probability of the question resolving YES (either event happening) can be calculated using the formula for the probability of at least one of two events occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since the events are independent (the mortgage rate and Cracker Jack demand are unrelated), P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Thus, P(YES) = 0.6 + 0.45 - (0.6 * 0.45) = 0.6 + 0.45 - 0.27 = 1.05 - 0.27 = 0.78.

As of the current date (June 30, 2024), the global economy is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, and many countries are facing inflationary pressures. New Zealand's economy has been performing relatively well, but it is not immune to global economic trends. The Central Bank of New Zealand has been closely monitoring the economy and has taken steps to control inflation. In recent months, the Central Bank of New Zealand has maintained a hawkish stance, raising interest rates to combat inflation. However, the Bank has also emphasized its commitment to supporting economic growth. Given the current economic conditions, it is possible that the Central Bank may consider additional stimulus measures to support growth, especially if inflationary pressures ease. There have been no recent statements or hints from the Central Bank's officials suggesting a new stimulus package is imminent. However, the Central Bank has a history of taking proactive measures to support the economy, and it is possible that they may announce a new package in response to changing economic conditions.

(a) The Central Bank of New Zealand announcing a new economic stimulus package: The Central Bank of New Zealand has a history of responding to economic downturns with monetary policy adjustments. The current economic situation in New Zealand is uncertain, with the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic trends affecting the country's growth. However, the Central Bank of New Zealand has already implemented several stimulus measures in recent years, which might reduce the likelihood of new announcements. Given the uncertainty and the potential need for further economic support, I estimate the probability of the Central Bank of New Zealand announcing a new economic stimulus package by August 2024 to be around 0.4 (40%). (b) South Korea's KOSPI index reaching or exceeding 3,500 points: The KOSPI index has historically been volatile, with significant fluctuations in response to global economic trends and local events. The index has already experienced a significant drop, which might make it more challenging to reach the 3,500 point level. However, the Korean economy has shown resilience in the past, and the index might recover or exceed the 3,500 point level if the global economic situation improves. Considering the uncertainty and the potential for the index to fluctuate, I estimate the probability of the KOSPI index reaching or exceeding 3,500 points by August 2024 to be around 0.55 (55%). To estimate the joint probability of both events occurring, we need to consider the independence of the two events. While the Central Bank of New Zealand's decision might be influenced by global economic trends, which could also affect the KOSPI index, the two events are not directly correlated.

For event (b), the KOSPI index reaching or exceeding 3,500 points, the index would need to increase by approximately 20% in the next 14 months.

Given the relatively short timeframe, it's possible that the Bank of England might consider a rate cut if economic conditions deteriorate or if inflation shows signs of easing.

That being said, based on historical trends and the Bank of England's general approach to monetary policy, I would estimate that the probability of an interest rate cut by August 2024 is relatively low, but not impossible.

Secondly, we should consider forecasts from reputable sources. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission have both released forecasts for the Italian economy in 2024.

This trend may continue, and Spotify, as a tech company, might be affected. 2. Company performance: Spotify's financial performance has been mixed in recent years. While the company has grown its user base and revenue, it has also faced increasing competition and pressure to improve profitability. If Spotify's financials don't improve, the company might consider further cost-cutting measures, including layoffs. 3. Previous layoffs: Spotify has already announced a 2% workforce reduction, which suggests that the company is taking steps to optimize its operations and reduce costs. This might indicate that Spotify is willing to make tough decisions to ensure its financial health, including potential future layoffs. 4. Timeframe: The question resolves in about 2 months (by August 31, 2024). This is a relatively short timeframe, which might reduce the likelihood of additional layoffs being announced.

Given the time frame between my knowledge cutoff and the resolution date, there is a possibility that the economic conditions may have changed, requiring the Bank to reassess its monetary policy stance. However, without more recent information, it is challenging to determine the likelihood of an interest rate cut. Historically, the Bank of England has been hesitant to cut interest rates unless there is a significant downturn in the economy. As of my knowledge cutoff, there were no clear indications of a severe economic downturn that would necessitate an interest rate cut. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of the Bank of England announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024 to be relatively low."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "59fc1dba-6bf3-475e-8473-5c27c9225b37", "title": "Will India eliminate export taxes on agricultural products by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the Indian government officially announces or implements a policy to completely eliminate export taxes on agricultural products.

First, let's consider the Bank of England's interest rate policy. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets interest rates to meet the 2% inflation target. As of the creation date (June 30, 2024), the UK inflation rate is not publicly available, but we can look at the general trend. If the inflation rate is high, the Bank of England might be more likely to increase interest rates to combat inflation, rather than cut them. However, if the inflation rate is low or decreasing, a rate cut is more plausible. Without the current inflation rate, it's difficult to make an accurate prediction, but we can assume a moderate likelihood of a rate cut. Second, let's consider India's export tax policy on agricultural products. India has been known to impose export taxes on certain agricultural products to control prices and ensure domestic supply. However, the Indian government has also been trying to increase agricultural exports. Eliminating export taxes on agricultural products could be a way to achieve this goal. There have been no recent reports or indications that the Indian government plans to eliminate these taxes, but it's possible that they might consider it in the future. Given the uncertainty surrounding both events, it's difficult to assign a high probability to either event occurring. However, since the question only requires one of the events to occur for a YES resolution, we can assign a moderate probability."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0035240810208283513, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0008810202552070878, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08402083975270852, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historically, India has experienced periods of high inflation, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been proactive in managing inflation through monetary policy adjustments. 2. Current Economic Conditions: As of my last update, the global economy is facing challenges such as supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors can influence inflation rates worldwide, including in India. However, India's economic resilience and the RBI's policies to control inflation would be crucial in determining the inflation trajectory. 3. Monetary Policy: The RBI has been cautious with its monetary policy, aiming to keep inflation within its target range while supporting economic growth. The central bank's actions, including interest rate decisions, play a significant role in managing inflation expectations. 4. Forecasting Inflation: Predicting inflation, especially on a month-over-month basis, involves a high degree of uncertainty due to the multitude of influencing factors. However, given the RBI's commitment to maintaining inflation within a target range (usually around 4% with a +/- 2% tolerance band), significant spikes above 0.5% in a single month would be notable. Considering these factors, while there is always a possibility of unexpected economic shocks leading to higher inflation, the RBI's proactive stance on inflation management suggests that large month-over-month increases above 0.5% might be less likely.

If the patent is still in force, it is unlikely that Astellas will allow generic production. 2.

Astellas and AstraZeneca have invested heavily in research and development for their cancer drugs, and it is likely they will want to maximize their returns by enforcing their patent rights. 2. Generic Production Allowance: Allowing generic production would mean a significant loss of revenue for both companies, as generic drugs are generally cheaper and could erode the market share of the original drugs. There is no apparent reason why either company would voluntarily give up their patent rights without a compelling reason, such as a major public health crisis or significant government pressure. 3. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory environment in the pharmaceutical industry is complex, and companies must navigate strict guidelines and regulations. While regulatory bodies may encourage generic production to increase accessibility and affordability, they are unlikely to force companies to relinquish their patent rights without a strong justification. 4. Public Pressure and Reputation: Both Astellas and AstraZeneca are well-established companies with a reputation for innovation and patient care. However, public pressure to make their cancer drugs more affordable might influence their decision-making. Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether this pressure would be sufficient to prompt them to allow generic production. 5. Timeframe: The question specifies a relatively short timeframe (by July 2024).

Understanding its historical highs and lows, as well as its recovery patterns, can provide insight into its potential future performance. 2. Current Market Conditions: As of the question's creation in June 2024, the current state of the market, including the index's value at that time, trends, and forecasts, would be crucial. However, without real-time data, we must consider typical market fluctuations and the potential for both growth and decline. 3. Economic Indicators: Factors such as GDP growth, inflation rates, employment numbers, and interest rates can significantly influence the stock market. A strong economy can support higher stock prices, while economic downturns can lead to declines. 4. Global Events and Uncertainty: Geopolitical tensions, health crises, and other global events can impact market stability. High levels of uncertainty can lead to market volatility. 5. Time Frame: The question specifies a period from October 2023 to August 2024, allowing ample time for market fluctuations. The longer the time frame, the higher the likelihood of the index reaching specific highs due to natural market volatility and growth trends. Given these considerations and assuming no catastrophic global events or significant economic downturns, the S&P 500 has a history of growth over time, albeit with fluctuations. The specific target of 4,800 points is somewhat arbitrary without knowing the exact market conditions at the start of the prediction period. However, the S&P 500 has reached and exceeded 4,800 points in the past, indicating that such levels are within its historical range.

To answer this question, we need to consider several factors, including the current political climate, public opinion on healthcare funding, and the history of protests in the UK. Firstly, the UK has a strong tradition of public protests and demonstrations, particularly when it comes to issues like healthcare, which is a highly emotive and sensitive topic. The National Health Service (NHS) is a cherished institution in the UK, and any perceived threats to its funding or services are likely to spark widespread outrage and mobilization. Secondly, the current political climate in the UK is highly polarized, with the ruling Conservative Party facing criticism for its handling of the NHS and healthcare funding. The opposition Labour Party has been vocal in its criticism of the government's healthcare policies, and there is a strong likelihood that they will continue to mobilize public opinion against any funding cuts. Thirdly, there have been several high-profile protests and demonstrations in the UK in recent years, including the 2019-2020 NHS strikes and the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. These protests have shown that the UK public is willing to take to the streets to express their discontent and demand change. Given these factors, it is likely that large protests will occur in the UK in response to healthcare funding cuts by July 2024.

Event (a): Central Bank of Israel announces an interest rate cut - The Central Bank of Israel's interest rate decisions are influenced by various economic factors, including inflation, growth, and global economic trends. As of the question's creation date (June 30, 2024), I don't have access to real-time data, but I can consider general trends and the bank's past behavior. The Central Bank of Israel has a history of adjusting interest rates in response to changing economic conditions. Assuming no significant changes in the global economic landscape, it's plausible that the bank might consider an interest rate cut if inflation is under control and growth is slowing. However, without current data, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of an interest rate cut. I'll assign a moderate probability to this event, considering the bank's past behavior and the potential for changing economic conditions. Event (b): Large protests occur in the UK in response to healthcare funding cuts - The UK has a history of public protests in response to government decisions, including those related to healthcare funding. The question specifies that the protests must be explicitly linked to healthcare funding cuts, which increases the specificity of the event. As of the question's creation date, I'm not aware of any specific plans for healthcare funding cuts or protests. However, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has faced funding pressures and controversies in the past. The likelihood of large protests depends on various factors, including the severity of funding cuts, public sentiment, and the mobilization of protest groups. Given the uncertainty and the need for specific conditions to be met (e.g., at least 1,000 participants, explicit link to healthcare funding cuts), I'll assign a lower probability to this event. Combined probability: To estimate the combined probability of both events occurring, I'll use a rough estimate of the individual probabilities and multiply them. Event (a): 0.4 (moderate probability) Event (b): 0.2 (lower probability) Combined probability: 0.4 \u00d7 0.2 = 0.08. The combined probability is relatively low due to the uncertainty surrounding both events and the need for specific conditions to be met.

As of the creation date (June 30, 2024), the current interest rate environment and future projections are crucial for this assessment. Historically, mortgage rates have fluctuated based on monetary policy, inflation rates, and broader economic conditions. The Federal Reserve's actions, particularly with the federal funds rate, have a significant impact on mortgage rates. As of June 2024, if the Fed has been raising interest rates to combat inflation or stabilize the economy, this could push mortgage rates higher. Conversely, if there's an economic downturn or inflation is under control, rates might stabilize or decrease. Given the question's specificity about the source of the rate (Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey) and the requirement for the rate to exceed 5.5% at any point during August 2024, we must consider the volatility of financial markets and the potential for rapid changes in interest rates based on new economic data or geopolitical events. Without access to real-time data or forecasts as of June 2024, it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, considering the dynamic nature of interest rates and the influence of various economic factors, there's always a possibility for rates to fluctuate significantly over a couple of months.

President Biden delivering a speech at a National Education Association event in Illinois: - The National Education Association (NEA) is a large and influential organization in the United States, with Illinois having a significant presence. - As President, Joe Biden has shown a willingness to engage with various groups, including labor unions and educational associations, to promote his policies and build support. - Given the NEA's prominence and the fact that Illinois is a key state, it's plausible that President Biden could deliver a speech at an NEA event there, especially considering the proximity to the 2024 presidential election. - However, the specific condition that the event must be held in Illinois narrows the scope, making this event somewhat less likely compared to if it were open to any state. 2. The United Food and Commercial Workers endorsing a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election: - The UFCW is a significant labor union with a history of political engagement, including endorsing presidential candidates. - Endorsements by major unions like the UFCW are often seen as important milestones in the presidential election cycle, providing candidates with both financial and grassroots support. - Given the timing (by July 2024), it's reasonable to expect that the UFCW might endorse a candidate as the election heats up and the field of candidates becomes clearer. - The condition that the endorsement must be for a specific candidate in the 2024 presidential race is straightforward and aligns with typical union endorsement practices. Considering these points, both events seem plausible and are influenced by factors such as the political climate, the specific interests of the NEA and UFCW, and the strategic decisions of President Biden and the UFCW leadership.

To answer this question, we need to consider several factors, including the complexity of the case, the court's schedule, and the likelihood of a settlement. Firstly, the question does not specify which major hotel chain operator is involved, which makes it difficult to assess the complexity of the case. However, we can assume that the case is likely to be complex, given that it involves allegations of negligence or gross negligence resulting in significant harm or loss. Secondly, the court's schedule is also an important factor to consider. Courts often have a heavy workload, and it may take several months or even years for a case to be heard. However, the question specifies that the ruling must be made by August 2024, which gives the court approximately 2 years to hear the case. Lastly, the likelihood of a settlement is also a factor to consider. If the parties involved are able to reach a settlement, the case may not go to trial, and therefore, there may not be a court ruling. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of a court ruling on the liability of a major hotel chain operator by August 2024 as follows: Probability: 0.6. This probability reflects my assessment that while the case is likely to be complex, the court has sufficient time to hear the case, and there is a reasonable likelihood that a ruling will be made by August 2024.

As of the question's creation date (June 30, 2024), the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which has been above its 2% target rate. However, the pace of rate hikes has slowed down in recent months, and some economists expect the Fed to pause or even cut rates in the near future. Given this context, it's possible that the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE), could show a monthly increase exceeding 0.5% by July 2024. However, it's also possible that the Fed's efforts to control inflation could lead to a slowdown in price growth, making it less likely for the PCE to exceed the 0.5% threshold. To estimate the probability of the question resolving YES, we can consider the following factors: 1. Historical data: The PCE has shown monthly increases exceeding 0.5% in the past, especially during periods of high inflation. 2. Current economic trends: The economy is still growing, but at a slower pace, which could lead to higher inflation. 3.

(a) Washington maintaining its $16 per hour minimum wage for fast food workers through July 2024: The decision to maintain or change the minimum wage typically involves political and economic considerations. Given that the wage has already been set at $16 per hour, there would need to be significant political will or economic pressure to change it. Without specific information suggesting a change is imminent, it's reasonable to assume the status quo will be maintained, especially since the wage is already higher than in many other states, which might reduce the urgency for further adjustments in the near term. Probability: 0.8 (Given the lack of information suggesting a change, it seems more likely than not that the wage will remain the same.) (b) The average rate on a 30-year mortgage exceeding 7.0% by August 2024: Mortgage rates are influenced by a variety of factors including economic indicators, monetary policy, and market expectations. As of my last update, rates have been fluctuating but generally trending upwards due to inflation concerns and central bank actions. However, predicting the exact timing and level of mortgage rates is challenging due to the complexity of these factors. That said, given the current trend and the relatively short timeframe (August 2024), there's a plausible scenario where rates could exceed 7.0% if economic conditions continue to support higher interest rates. Probability: 0.6 (This is a bit more uncertain than the wage scenario, given the volatility of financial markets and the influence of numerous factors on mortgage rates.) To combine these probabilities into a single estimate for the question resolving YES, we multiply the probabilities of each condition being met, assuming they are independent of each other: 0.8 (minimum wage condition) * 0.6 (mortgage rate condition) = 0.48.

(a) Imposition of new regulatory curbs on Yes Bank's lending by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) by August 2024: The RBI has been proactive in regulating and supervising banks to ensure financial stability and compliance with regulatory requirements. Given Yes Bank's history, including a major crisis in 2020 that led to a reconstruction scheme, it's plausible that the RBI might impose new or additional regulatory measures to ensure the bank's lending practices are aligned with regulatory standards. The RBI regularly monitors and updates its regulatory framework. The imposition of new curbs specifically targeting Yes Bank could be part of this ongoing process, especially if there have been concerns raised about the bank's lending practices. However, predicting specific regulatory actions can be challenging due to the complexity of financial regulation and the discretion available to the RBI. (b) The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) announcing new funding commitments totaling over $400 million by July 2024: The FAO frequently announces new initiatives and funding commitments aimed at addressing global food security, agricultural development, and emergency response needs. Given the ongoing global challenges such as climate change, conflicts, and economic downturns affecting food security, it's reasonable to expect the FAO to continue announcing significant funding commitments to address these issues. The FAO's budget and funding commitments can fluctuate based on donor contributions and global priorities, but the organization has a history of securing substantial funding for its programs. Combining these assessments: Both conditions involve predictions about future actions by significant organizations (the RBI and the FAO), which are subject to various internal and external factors. There's a reasonable basis to expect both organizations to take actions that could meet the conditions outlined, given their past behaviors and the ongoing needs in their respective domains. However, the specificity of the conditions (especially the amount for the FAO funding commitments and the targeting of Yes Bank by the RBI) introduces uncertainty. Given these considerations, the probability that both conditions will be met seems moderate. It's plausible but not guaranteed, considering the complexities and uncertainties involved in predicting regulatory actions and funding commitments."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "861a237c-3a5c-4966-b4dc-76ed7395b7fb", "title": "Will either of the following occur by mid-2024: (a) The Reserve Bank of India imposes new regulatory curbs on Yes Bank's lending, or (b) The Food and Agriculture Organization announces new funding commitments totaling over $400 million?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) By August 31, 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announces new regulatory curbs specifically targeting Yes Bank's lending practices.

Given the current global economic trends and the potential for a slowdown, it is possible that the Bank of Korea might consider reducing its key interest rate to stimulate the economy. However, the Bank of Korea also needs to balance this with inflation control. As of now, there is no clear indication of an imminent rate cut, but it cannot be ruled out entirely.

While there have been instances where jobless claims exceeded 275,000, the current labor market is relatively strong.

However, given the size and global presence of Alibaba, labor disputes are not uncommon in large corporations.

Probability of large protests occurring in Indonesia in response to religious freedom legislation by July 2024: 0.4 (considering the potential for religious tensions and the specificity of the conditions). The probability of both events occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities, assuming independence: 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12. The estimate is based on general considerations of labor disputes and religious tensions without specific current information. The actual probability could be significantly different based on emerging details."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "833edd8d-c8af-4079-a310-a6658ef903f8", "title": "Will either of the following occur by July 2024: (a) Alibaba Group resolves a major workers' strike, or (b) Large protests occur in Indonesia over religious freedom legislation?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs by July 31, 2024:\n\n(a) Alibaba Group reaches an agreement with unionized workers, ending a significant strike.

Given the specific conditions required for this event to resolve YES (involvement of at least 1,000 workers, strike lasting at least one week, and confirmation from both Alibaba Group and the union, reported by at least two reputable international news sources), the likelihood seems relatively low without any current indications of such a strike. Event (b) pertains to large protests in Indonesia over religious freedom legislation. Indonesia has a complex religious landscape and has seen protests related to religious issues in the past. However, the occurrence of such protests is often unpredictable and depends on various factors, including the specifics of the legislation and the political climate at the time. Given the requirement for at least 1,000 participants and coverage by major international news outlets, the probability is somewhat higher than event (a) due to Indonesia's history of public demonstrations on religious issues. However, without specific legislation being proposed or a clear indication of widespread discontent, this event also remains speculative. Considering these factors, the overall probability of either event occurring by July 2024 seems moderate, given the specificity of the conditions for both events and the lack of current evidence pointing towards their occurrence.

(b) Google resolving a major workers' strike: Google has faced labor disputes and unionization efforts in recent years, but a major workers' strike involving at least 1,000 participants is a significant event that might not occur by July 2024. While it's possible that Google workers might organize a strike, the company has taken steps to address worker concerns and improve working conditions, which might reduce the likelihood of a major strike. Additionally, the resolution criteria require a substantial number of workers, a minimum duration of one week, and confirmation from both Google and the involved union, which adds to the complexity and uncertainty of this scenario.

(a) Interest Rate Cut by Central Bank of Mexico: The Central Bank of Mexico's monetary policy decisions are influenced by various factors, including inflation, economic growth, and global economic trends. Given the current global economic uncertainty and the potential for inflationary pressures, it's plausible that the Central Bank of Mexico might consider an interest rate cut to stimulate economic growth. However, without specific information on the current economic conditions in Mexico or the Bank's policy stance, it's challenging to assign a high probability to this event. (b) Fisker Receiving Over $500 Million in Grants: Fisker is an electric vehicle manufacturer, and the U.S. federal government has been actively promoting the adoption of electric vehicles through various incentives and grants. Given the growing focus on sustainable energy and transportation, it's possible that Fisker might receive significant funding for its electric vehicle initiatives. However, the amount of $500 million is substantial, and without information on Fisker's current projects, funding requirements, or the government's grant allocation plans, it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of this event. Considering the uncertainty surrounding both events, I'll assign a moderate probability to each event occurring individually.

This suggests that such a policy is not widely adopted across the United States. Secondly, implementing a 72-hour waiting period for voting registration would likely be a controversial move, as it could be seen as restricting access to voting.

Condition 1: Another U.S. state implements a 72-hour waiting period for voting registration by August 2024. The implementation of voting registration waiting periods is a contentious issue that varies significantly by state, often reflecting the political leanings of the state's government. Given the specific requirement of a 72-hour waiting period and the need for it to be implemented through official state legislation or government announcements, reported by at least two major national news outlets, this condition seems challenging to fulfill within the given timeframe. States that might consider such legislation would likely face opposition, potentially slowing down the process. Moreover, the specificity of the 72-hour period narrows down the possibilities, as states might opt for longer or shorter waiting periods based on their political and legal considerations. Given these considerations, the likelihood of another state implementing a 72-hour waiting period by August 2024 seems low.

Given the political climate and the specific requirement for official state announcements or reporting by major news organizations, this condition's fulfillment is also uncertain. However, there has been a trend towards reconsidering work requirements in some states due to legal challenges and changing political landscapes. Considering the trend and the potential for policy shifts, this condition might have a slightly higher likelihood than the first. However, given the need for concrete action by July 2024, I would still estimate this condition's probability at around 0.3 (or 30%). Combining the Probabilities: To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities of each event occurring. 0.2 (Condition 1) * 0.3 (Condition 2) = 0.06 Therefore, the estimated probability of both conditions being met is 0.06, or 6%.

BNSF Railway and the Conductors' Union Agreement: The dispute between BNSF Railway and the conductors' union has been ongoing, with work schedule predictability being a key issue. Given the nature of labor disputes and the specific requirement for an agreement that directly addresses this issue, there are several factors to consider: - Labor Negotiations Complexity: Labor negotiations, especially those involving specific, contentious issues like work schedule predictability, can be complex and time-consuming. The fact that this issue has been a point of contention suggests that finding a mutually acceptable solution might not be straightforward. - Public Announcement and Confirmation: The requirement for a public announcement and confirmation by both parties, as well as reporting by at least two major news outlets, adds a layer of formality and publicity to the agreement. This could potentially expedite negotiations, as both parties may be motivated to demonstrate progress and resolution publicly. - Timeframe: The deadline of August 31, 2024, provides a specific timeframe for negotiations. While this could focus efforts, the complexity of the issue and the need for a detailed agreement that addresses work schedule predictability might make meeting this deadline challenging. 2. Colorado's Free Community College Plan Implementation: Implementing a free community college plan by July 31, 2024, involves several steps, including legislative approval, budget allocation, and operational setup. Key considerations include: - Legislative and Budgetary Processes: The implementation of such a plan would typically require legislative approval and budget allocation. These processes can be unpredictable and subject to political and fiscal considerations. - Operational Setup: Beyond legislative approval, the actual implementation involves setting up the necessary infrastructure, which includes administrative processes, financial aid systems, and potentially adjustments in tuition fee structures. - Political Will and Public Support: The success of implementing a free community college plan also depends on political will and public support. Given the educational and economic benefits such a plan could offer, there might be significant support, but political and financial hurdles could still arise. Given these considerations, estimating the probability of both events occurring by mid-2024 involves assessing the likelihood of successful labor negotiations and legislative/administrative actions within the specified timeframe.

Condition 1: French economy avoiding recession by July 2024. The French economy's performance is influenced by various factors, including global economic trends, European economic policies, and internal factors such as consumer spending and business investment. While it's challenging to predict with certainty, we can look at current trends and forecasts. As of the creation date (June 30, 2024), the global economy is experiencing a slowdown, and the European economy, in particular, is facing challenges. However, France's economy has shown resilience in the past, and the European Central Bank's monetary policies aim to support economic growth. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the French economy avoiding a recession by July 2024 as 0.6 (60%). This is a relatively cautious estimate, acknowledging the uncertainty and potential risks in the global economy. Condition 2: Central Bank of Mexico's preferred inflation measure showing a monthly increase exceeding 0.5% by July 2024. The Central Bank of Mexico's preferred inflation measure is the Core Inflation Index, which has been relatively stable in recent months. Mexico's inflation rate has been within the target range of 2-4% annual inflation rate, with a current rate around 3.5%. Given the stable inflation environment and the Central Bank's efforts to maintain price stability, I estimate the probability of the Core Inflation Index showing a monthly increase exceeding 0.5% by July 2024 as 0.7 (70%). This is a relatively high estimate, considering the Bank's track record of managing inflation and the current economic conditions. Combined probability: To calculate the combined probability of both conditions being met, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.6 (French economy avoiding recession) \u00d7 0.7 (Central Bank of Mexico's preferred inflation measure showing a monthly increase exceeding 0.5%) = 0.42.

Firstly, let's consider the French economy. As of the question's creation date (June 30, 2024), the French economy has not yet entered a recession. However, predicting GDP growth is inherently uncertain, and there are various factors that could impact the French economy in the remaining months. While there is no clear indication of an impending recession, we should be cautious in our assessment. Let's assume a 60% probability that the French economy will avoid a recession by July 2024. Secondly, let's consider the Central Bank of Mexico's preferred inflation measure. Inflation rates can be volatile and influenced by various factors, including monetary policy, economic growth, and external shocks. Given the time frame of October 2023 to July 2024, it is possible that the inflation measure could exceed 0.5% in at least one month. However, without more specific information on the current inflation trend and the Central Bank of Mexico's policy stance, we should be cautious in our assessment.

However, we can consider some general points. Major projects like the drone delivery initiative often face delays due to various factors, including regulatory hurdles, technical challenges, and funding issues. Therefore, it might be optimistic to assume the project will be completed on time. Regarding the FAO's funding commitments, the organization regularly announces new initiatives and funding commitments. However, the specific amount of $400 million is substantial, and it's uncertain whether the FAO plans to make such a significant announcement by July 2024. Considering these points, it seems reasonable to assume that both events have a relatively low to moderate probability of occurring by July 2024. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to estimate the exact probabilities. Given the lack of specific information on the current status of both events, I will make a general estimate based on the assumption that both events have a moderate probability of occurring.

(a) Netflix announces a new major sports media partnership: Netflix has been expanding its sports content offerings, including documentaries and live events. Given the trend of streaming services investing in sports content to attract and retain subscribers, it's plausible that Netflix would seek to announce a new major sports media partnership. However, the specificity of this condition (requiring a 'major sports league, organization, or event') narrows the scope. Considering Netflix's past moves and the competitive landscape, there's a reasonable chance they might pursue such a partnership to stay competitive. Probability for (a): 0.6 (60%). (b) The NFL settles the 'Sunday Ticket' antitrust case for less than $4.7 billion: Antitrust cases can be complex and unpredictable. The settlement amount would depend on various factors, including the strength of the case, the willingness of parties to settle, and the negotiation dynamics. Without specific details on the case's progress or the parties' stances, it's challenging to estimate the settlement amount accurately.

Current Legal Landscape: As of the question's creation date (June 30, 2024), the Illinois Supreme Court has already struck down state laws regulating abortion providers more strictly than other healthcare providers and banned a common second-trimester procedure. This decision sets a precedent that would need to be overturned or significantly altered for the question to resolve as NO. 2. Judicial Stability and Precedent: Courts, especially at the supreme level, tend to respect precedent and stability in the law. Overturning a recent decision would require significant new arguments or a substantial shift in the court's composition, which is less likely within a short period. 3. Political and Social Climate: The political and social climate around abortion is highly polarized. However, Illinois has shown a trend towards supporting abortion access. The state's political leaning and the current national discourse might influence the court's decisions, but without a dramatic shift, it's less likely that the court would reverse its stance so soon after the initial ruling. 4. Timeframe: The question resolves by July 31, 2024, which is roughly a month after the creation date. This is a relatively short period for a significant legal reversal, especially considering the time needed for legal challenges to be filed, argued, and decided upon. Considering these factors, the likelihood of the Illinois Supreme Court reversing or significantly altering its decision within the given timeframe seems low. The court's respect for precedent, the political climate in Illinois, and the short timeframe until the question's resolution all contribute to this assessment."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6fe97b79-7cf6-4f31-a9fe-a98514961c6b", "title": "Will the HHS's rule on telehealth services be enacted by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if, by August 31, 2024, a new Department of Health and Human Services rule specifically targeting the regulation of telehealth services is enacted through legal or administrative means.

Additionally, the fact that the question specifies that the rule must be enacted through legal or administrative means and confirmed through official announcements by the HHS, court rulings, or other authoritative legal sources, suggests that the rule is likely to be enacted. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of event (b) occurring as around 0.8. Since the question resolves YES if at least one of the events occurs, we need to calculate the probability of either event (a) or event (b) occurring. Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events, we get: P(a or b) = P(a) + P(b) - P(a and b).

Firstly, regarding New York, there have been efforts to legalize marijuana in the state, but the process has been slow. In 2021, the New York State Legislature passed a bill legalizing recreational marijuana, but it did not include a provision for a referendum. Since then, there have been no significant developments towards holding a referendum on marijuana legalization. Given this context, the likelihood of New York holding a referendum on marijuana legalization by July 2024 seems low. Secondly, regarding Pennsylvania, there have been discussions about tax reform, but no concrete plans for a referendum have been announced. In 2022, the Pennsylvania Senate passed a bill that would have allowed voters to decide on a constitutional amendment to reduce the state's corporate net income tax rate, but it did not move forward.

Component (a): Facebook's AI Content Moderation System Spreading Election Misinformation: 1. Context and Precedent: Social media platforms, including Facebook, have faced numerous challenges and criticisms regarding the spread of misinformation, especially during election periods. The use of AI in content moderation has been a point of contention, with some arguing it can inadvertently spread misinformation or fail to catch it effectively. 2. Election Environment: The period leading up to August 2024 will likely be filled with political activity, including elections. This environment increases the likelihood of misinformation spreading. 3. Reporting and Awareness: Given the heightened awareness and scrutiny around election misinformation, it's plausible that there will be credible reports or warnings issued by the specified sources. However, the requirement for these reports to specifically mention Facebook's AI system as the culprit adds a layer of complexity. 4. Probability Assessment: Considering the factors above, while it's certainly possible that there will be issues with Facebook's AI content moderation system, the specificity of the requirement (credible reports mentioning the AI system by August 2024) makes this less likely. Probability: 0.4. Component (b): Mississippi Holding a Referendum on Abortion Rights: 1. Political Climate: The topic of abortion rights is highly politicized and contentious in the United States. Given the current legal and political landscape, especially post-Roe v. Wade, there is a significant interest in abortion rights at both the state and federal levels. 2. State-Level Actions: Mississippi has been at the forefront of restrictive abortion legislation. However, the likelihood of a referendum being called and completed by July 2024 is less clear, as it depends on political will, legal challenges, and the state's legislative and electoral processes. 3. Probability Assessment: Considering the intense focus on abortion rights and the potential for state-level action, it's plausible that Mississippi could hold a referendum. However, the short timeframe and the need for official announcement and completion by July 31, 2024, make this challenging. Probability: 0.3. Combining Probabilities: To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities of each event occurring: 0.4 (Probability of Facebook's AI system being reported for spreading election misinformation) * 0.3 (Probability of Mississippi holding a referendum on abortion rights) = 0.12.

Current Labor Market Trends: As of the creation date (June 30, 2024), the U.S. labor market has shown resilience despite some signs of slowing down. The unemployment rate has remained low, and job growth, although not as robust as in previous years, continues to be positive. However, there are indications of a potential slowdown in the economy, which could impact the labor market. 2. Historical Context of Jobless Claims: Historically, the number of initial jobless claims has been a reliable indicator of the labor market's health. A sustained increase in jobless claims often signals economic slowdown or recession. However, the threshold of 250,000 claims per week is relatively moderate. In times of economic expansion, it's not uncommon for weekly jobless claims to fluctuate around this number, but sustained periods above this level for five consecutive weeks would indicate a notable weakening in the labor market. 3. Economic Forecast and Potential Risks: The period leading up to August 2024 is subject to various economic risks, including inflation, interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical tensions. Any significant escalation of these factors could lead to a downturn in the economy, potentially pushing jobless claims above the 250,000 threshold for an extended period. 4. Timeframe: The question specifies a resolution by August 31, 2024, providing a relatively short window for the condition to be met. This timeframe is crucial because it limits the opportunity for sustained economic downturns to develop and impact the labor market significantly. Considering these factors, while there are potential risks to the economy that could lead to an increase in jobless claims, the current state of the labor market and the relatively short timeframe make it less likely for the condition to be met.

Given that the declaration must be made by Nigeria's health authorities or the WHO and reported by reputable news sources, the likelihood depends on the current status of the outbreak, which is not provided in the prompt.

To estimate the probability of either event occurring, we need to consider the current economic climate and the factors that might influence these events. Firstly, the Bank of England's interest rate decisions are influenced by various factors such as inflation, economic growth, and employment rates. Given the current economic uncertainty and the potential for a global slowdown, it is possible that the Bank of England might consider an interest rate cut to stimulate economic growth. However, this decision would also depend on the inflation outlook, as high inflation might prevent the Bank from cutting interest rates. Secondly, the German economy has been experiencing a slowdown, and there are concerns about a potential recession. However, the definition of a recession in this question is specific - two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. While there are risks to the German economy, it is also possible that the economy might experience a slowdown without meeting the technical definition of a recession. Given these considerations, it is difficult to estimate the exact probability of either event occurring. However, we can make an educated guess based on current trends and the factors that might influence these events. Let's assume that the probability of the Bank of England announcing an interest rate cut by August 2024 is around 30%, given the current economic uncertainty and the potential for a global slowdown. Similarly, let's assume that the probability of the German economy avoiding a recession by July 2024 is around 60%, given the risks to the economy but also the possibility that the slowdown might not meet the technical definition of a recession. Since the question asks for the probability of either event occurring, we need to calculate the probability of the union of these two events. Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events (P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B)), we can estimate the probability as follows: P(A \u222a B) = P(Bank of England announces an interest rate cut) + P(German economy avoids a recession) - P(Both events occur) = 0.3 + 0.6 - P(Both events occur). To estimate P(Both events occur), we need to consider the correlation between the two events. If the two events are independent, then P(Both events occur) = P(Bank of England announces an interest rate cut) \u00d7 P(German economy avoids a recession) = 0.3 \u00d7 0.6 = 0.18. However, if the two events are correlated, then P(Both events occur) might be higher or lower than this estimate. Assuming independence, we can estimate the probability of either event occurring as follows: P(A \u222a B) = 0.3 + 0.6 - 0.18 = 0.72.

On the other hand, Michigan holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024 seems more plausible. In 2022, Michigan voters approved a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights, and there is ongoing advocacy for further protections. Additionally, the Michigan state government has shown willingness to address reproductive rights issues.

These factors include the overall state of the automotive industry, the company's recent financial trends, and any potential challenges or opportunities that may arise in the next year. Historically, Mercedes-Benz has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly net income due to various market and economic factors. However, the company has generally shown resilience and adaptability in response to these challenges. In recent years, the automotive industry has faced significant disruptions, including supply chain issues, changes in consumer behavior, and increased competition from electric vehicle manufacturers. Despite these challenges, Mercedes-Benz has continued to invest in innovation and expansion, which could potentially drive future growth. Looking ahead to 2024, there are several factors that could contribute to an increase in Mercedes-Benz's quarterly net income. For example, the company may benefit from improved supply chain management, increased demand for its electric vehicles, and cost-saving measures implemented in response to previous challenges. However, there are also potential risks that could negatively impact the company's financial performance, such as increased competition, regulatory changes, and global economic uncertainty. Given these factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Mercedes-Benz's quarterly net income will increase by over 20% year-over-year by July 2024.

Public and Political Pressure: Given the high-profile nature of the case, public opinion and political pressures could play a significant role. Both the plaintiff and the defendants might be motivated to settle to avoid further public scrutiny and political fallout. 4. Timeframe: The question specifies a settlement must be reached by July 2024.

Given the complexity and emotional nature of the case, it's challenging to predict the outcome. However, I'll consider the following factors: 1.

To estimate the probability of this event, we need to consider several factors, including the severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of public health responses, and the accuracy of reporting. First, let's consider the severity of the outbreak. E. coli outbreaks can be severe, but they are relatively rare and usually affect a limited number of people. According to the CDC, there were 157 reported E. coli outbreaks in the United States between 2013 and 2018, resulting in a total of 3,407 cases and 44 deaths. This suggests that E. coli outbreaks are typically not extremely deadly. However, the current outbreak is already notable for its severity, with multiple reported deaths and a large number of cases. This suggests that the outbreak may be more severe than usual, which could increase the likelihood of more than 10 deaths. Next, let's consider the effectiveness of public health responses. The CDC and other health authorities have likely taken steps to contain the outbreak, such as recalling contaminated lettuce, increasing surveillance, and improving hygiene practices. These measures can help reduce the spread of the outbreak and prevent further cases and deaths. Finally, let's consider the accuracy of reporting. The question requires official confirmation of deaths from credible sources, such as the CDC or equivalent health authorities, and reporting by at least two reputable news outlets. This ensures that the death toll is accurately reported and not exaggerated. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of the question resolving YES as follows: Probability: 0.25 This probability reflects my assessment that while the outbreak is severe and has already resulted in multiple deaths, the effectiveness of public health responses and the accuracy of reporting will likely prevent the death toll from exceeding 10.

Condition (a) involves a recall of Sara Lee packaged meats due to a listeria outbreak. While food recalls can happen at any time, listeria outbreaks are relatively rare. According to the CDC, there were only 12 reported listeria outbreaks in the United States between 2011 and 2020, resulting in 224 cases and 44 deaths. Given the low frequency of listeria outbreaks and the fact that Sara Lee is a large food company with robust food safety protocols in place, the likelihood of a listeria outbreak leading to a recall seems low. Condition (b) involves the E. coli outbreak tied to lettuce resulting in more than 10 confirmed deaths. E. coli outbreaks can be more common than listeria outbreaks, but the number of deaths attributed to a single outbreak is typically low. According to the CDC, between 2011 and 2020, there were 54 reported E. coli outbreaks in the United States, resulting in 1,444 cases and 26 deaths. While it's possible that the current outbreak could result in more than 10 deaths, the likelihood of this occurring seems relatively low. To estimate the combined probability of either condition (a) or (b) occurring, we can use a rough estimate of the individual probabilities. Let's assume the probability of condition (a) occurring is around 0.05 (5%) and the probability of condition (b) occurring is around 0.10 (10%). Since these events are independent, we can add the probabilities together to get the combined probability: 0.05 + 0.10 = 0.15. However, since the question asks for the probability of either event occurring, we should also consider the possibility of both events occurring. While this is unlikely, it's not impossible. To account for this, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

Development and Deployment of AI Systems: Governments worldwide are increasingly investing in AI technologies for various purposes, including public services, defense, and governance. This trend suggests that the development and deployment of AI systems by governments are likely to continue and expand. 2. Potential for Spreading Misinformation: AI systems, especially those involved in information dissemination or social media management, can potentially spread misinformation.

In 2023, the Iowa legislature passed a bill banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, which was signed into law by the governor. This suggests that there is a strong anti-abortion sentiment among Iowa lawmakers. However, it's worth noting that passing a total abortion ban is a more extreme measure than the six-week ban, and it may face more opposition, even from some Republicans.

This could potentially lead to increased layoffs and higher jobless claims. However, the labor market has been relatively resilient, with low unemployment rates. Historically, weekly jobless claims have fluctuated, often staying below 250,000 during periods of economic growth. However, during times of economic downturn, claims can spike. Given the current economic conditions, it's possible that jobless claims might increase, but exceeding 250,000 for five consecutive weeks is a significant threshold.

As of my last update in April 2024, the Australian economy had shown resilience despite global economic challenges. However, predicting economic trends, especially over a short term, is inherently uncertain due to factors like global market fluctuations, geopolitical events, and domestic policy changes. Assuming no major unforeseen disruptions, the Australian economy might continue on its current trajectory, but the risk of recession cannot be entirely ruled out. Condition (b) involves U.S. previously occupied home sales showing a decline for two consecutive months by July 2024. The U.S. housing market is influenced by interest rates, economic growth, and consumer confidence, among other factors. With the Federal Reserve's monetary policy adjustments and the overall economic outlook, there's a plausible scenario where housing sales could experience fluctuations, including declines. However, predicting the exact timing and consistency of such declines is challenging. Given these considerations, both conditions have a degree of uncertainty. The Australian economy's resilience as of my last update suggests a moderate to high likelihood of avoiding recession, but this is subject to change.

Condition (a): The Australian economy enters a recession. To estimate the probability of this event, I will consider the current economic indicators and trends in Australia. As of the creation date (June 30, 2024), the Australian economy has been experiencing a slowdown, with GDP growth rates declining in recent quarters. However, it is still unclear whether this slowdown will lead to a recession. I will consider the following factors: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could potentially slow down the economy further. The Australian government has implemented fiscal policies to stimulate the economy, which might help mitigate the risk of a recession. Global economic trends, such as the US-China trade tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic, could impact Australia's economy and increase the risk of a recession. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of the Australian economy entering a recession by July 2024 to be around 30%. Condition (b): U.S. previously occupied home sales show a decline for two consecutive months. To estimate the probability of this event, I will consider the current trends in the US housing market. As of the creation date (June 30, 2024), the US housing market has been experiencing a slowdown, with existing home sales declining in recent months. However, it is still unclear whether this decline will continue for two consecutive months. I will consider the following factors: The US Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates, which could lead to higher mortgage rates and slower home sales. The US economy has been experiencing a slowdown, which could impact the housing market. The US housing market has been subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect the sales data. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of US previously occupied home sales declining for two consecutive months by July 2024 to be around 40%. Since the question resolves as YES if either of the conditions occurs, I will calculate the probability of at least one of the conditions occurring. Assuming independence between the two conditions, the probability of at least one of the conditions occurring is 1 - (probability of neither condition occurring).

Given the Democratic Party's generally more progressive stance on LGBTQ+ issues, this could be seen as a favorable environment for enacting laws that support transgender youth. Secondly, we should consider the recent legislative trends and efforts in Michigan related to transgender rights. In 2023, Michigan repealed a law that banned gender-affirming care for minors, which could be seen as a positive step towards more inclusive policies. Thirdly, we should also consider the potential opposition and challenges that such a law might face.

To answer this question, we need to consider several factors, including the current status of the outbreak, the WHO's past actions, and the criteria for declaring an outbreak a global emergency. The WHO declares a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) when an outbreak poses a risk to global health. The Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa has been ongoing since 2023, and the WHO has been closely monitoring the situation. The WHO considers several factors, including the severity of the outbreak, the number of cases and deaths, the geographical spread, and the potential for international spread. Given the current information, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether the WHO will declare the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa no longer a global emergency by August 2024. However, we can make an educated guess based on past trends and the WHO's actions. In the past, the WHO has declared outbreaks a global emergency when they pose a significant risk to global health. However, the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa has been relatively contained, with a limited number of cases and deaths reported. Additionally, the WHO has been working closely with local authorities to control the outbreak, and there have been no reports of international spread. Based on these factors, it is possible that the WHO may declare the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa no longer a global emergency by August 2024, especially if the number of cases and deaths continues to decline and the outbreak remains contained. However, it is also possible that the WHO may maintain the emergency status of the outbreak, especially if there are concerns about the potential for international spread or if the outbreak worsens. Therefore, I would estimate the probability of the WHO declaring the Rift Valley fever outbreak in East Africa no longer a global emergency by August 2024 as follows: Probability: 0.6. This probability reflects the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak and the WHO's actions.

For part (a), without specific information about Takeda's patent status, licensing agreements, or intentions, it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of this event occurring. However, pharmaceutical companies often fiercely protect their patents, and voluntary patent withdrawals or non-enforcement are relatively rare. Thus, without strong evidence to the contrary, this event seems unlikely. For part (b), the WHO's declaration of an outbreak as a global emergency is typically based on the severity and spread of the disease. Rift Valley fever is a serious disease, but the WHO's classification can be influenced by various factors, including the effectiveness of control measures and the number of cases. Without current data on the outbreak's status, it's challenging to predict this outcome accurately. However, the WHO tends to be cautious in declaring emergencies and even more cautious in declaring them over, suggesting this event also has a degree of uncertainty.

Given this global trend, it's plausible that New York City, a major tourist hub with a significant short-term rental market, might follow suit. 2. Local Politics and Housing Market: New York City has a highly competitive and expensive housing market.

Firstly, we need to assess the likelihood of each government making such an announcement individually. The Australian Government has been actively promoting the use of biofuels as part of its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, the government announced a plan to increase the use of biofuels in the transportation sector, which includes converting government vehicles to run on biofuel.

In 2020, the royal family announced that they would be converting some of their vehicles to run on biofuel. However, the royal court's announcements and actions may be less frequent and less publicized compared to the Australian Government, making it slightly less likely that they will make a similar announcement by July 2024.

Third, we should consider the timing of the initial layoff announcement and the typical timeframe for companies to reassess their workforce needs. If the initial layoffs were recent, it might be less likely for the company to announce additional cuts soon after, as they may want to assess the impact of the first round of layoffs before making further decisions.

Firstly, Russia is one of the world's largest wheat and barley producers, and its agricultural sector is heavily influenced by weather conditions. A successful winter crop season would require favorable weather conditions, such as adequate rainfall and temperatures, during the critical growth periods. Secondly, Russia's agricultural sector has been experiencing some challenges in recent years, including soil degradation, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to credit and technology. These challenges could impact the sector's ability to produce high yields. Thirdly, the Russian government has been implementing policies aimed at supporting the agricultural sector, such as subsidies, investments in infrastructure, and initiatives to improve soil fertility. These policies could help to improve crop yields and increase the chances of a successful winter crop season. Given these factors, it is difficult to make a precise prediction about the outcome of the winter crop season.

However, the process of organizing a referendum is complex and time-consuming, involving legislative approval, signature collection, or a combination of both.

Medical debt cancellation is a growing trend globally, with many organizations and governments taking steps to address the issue. France has a well-developed healthcare system, and it is possible that a major hospital system could collaborate with a nonprofit organization to cancel medical debt. The cancellation must target patients who are considered financially needy or unable to pay, which aligns with the goals of many medical debt cancellation initiatives. Combining the probabilities of both events: Assuming the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of each event occurring. Based on the information provided, it seems likely that the UNDP will announce new funding commitments, but the likelihood of a major hospital system in France canceling over \u20ac250 million in medical debt is less clear.

To estimate the probability of either event occurring, we need to consider the likelihood of each event separately and then combine them. Event (a) involves the UNDP announcing new funding commitments. The UNDP is a large organization with a significant budget, and it regularly announces new funding commitments. However, the amount of $400 million is substantial, and it's unclear whether the UNDP will announce new commitments of this magnitude in the specified timeframe. Additionally, the funding commitments must be new initiatives or significant expansions, not continuations of previous commitments, which might limit the possibilities. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of event (a) occurring at around 0.3. Event (b) involves a major hospital system in France canceling medical debt. While there have been instances of hospitals and non-profit organizations canceling medical debt in the past, the amount of \u20ac250 million is significant, and it's unclear whether a hospital system in France will take such action in the specified timeframe. Furthermore, the cancellation must be announced by the hospital system or reported by at least two major news outlets, which adds an additional layer of uncertainty. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of event (b) occurring at around 0.2. Since the question asks about either event occurring, we need to combine the probabilities. Assuming independence between the two events, the probability of either event occurring is 1 - (probability of neither event occurring). The probability of neither event occurring is (1 - 0.3) \u00d7 (1 - 0.2) = 0.56.

In recent years, there has been a trend of states considering or passing legislation related to abortion rights, often in response to changes in federal law or court decisions.

However, the process of putting a referendum on the ballot can be complex and time-consuming, involving legislative approval, signature collection, or other steps.

In 2022, the FDA issued a warning letter to several companies for importing spices contaminated with lead.

Hillshire Farm issuing a recall of sausage products due to a listeria outbreak by August 2024. 2. The FDA issuing a recall for ground ginger products due to lead contamination by July 2024. Reasoning for (1): The probability of a listeria outbreak occurring at Hillshire Farm and prompting a recall is difficult to estimate due to the lack of historical data on listeria outbreaks at the company. However, we can consider the overall incidence of listeria outbreaks in the food industry. According to the CDC, there are approximately 1,600 cases of listeriosis reported in the United States each year. Given the large number of food manufacturers and the relatively low number of reported cases, the probability of a listeria outbreak occurring at Hillshire Farm in a given year is likely low. Reasoning for (2): The probability of the FDA issuing a recall for ground ginger products due to lead contamination is also difficult to estimate. However, we can consider the FDA's track record on issuing recalls for contaminated products. According to the FDA's website, the agency issues numerous recalls each year for various products, including food and spices. However, the number of recalls for lead contamination in spices is relatively low. For example, in 2020, the FDA issued only a handful of recalls for lead-contaminated spices. Given the relatively low number of recalls for lead contamination, the probability of the FDA issuing a recall for ground ginger products due to lead contamination in a given year is likely low. Reasoning for both events occurring: Since both events are independent, we can multiply their individual probabilities to estimate the probability of both events occurring. Assuming a low probability for each event (e.g., 0.01 for the listeria outbreak and 0.005 for the lead contamination recall), the probability of both events occurring would be approximately 0.00005 (0.01 x 0.005)."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "085d1ce1-7671-4827-92ec-677a2374aee7", "title": "Will either Hillshire Farm issue a recall of sausage products due to a listeria outbreak by August 2024, or will the FDA issue a recall for ground ginger products due to lead contamination by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if either of the following occurs:\n\n1.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the likelihood of each event occurring separately and then combine them. First, let's consider the likelihood of a listeria outbreak leading to a recall of Hillshire Farm sausage products. Listeria outbreaks are relatively rare, and it's difficult to predict when and where they will occur. However, Hillshire Farm is a large food manufacturer with a wide distribution network, which increases the risk of contamination. Additionally, listeria outbreaks have occurred in the past in the meat industry, so it's not unprecedented. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of a listeria outbreak leading to a recall of Hillshire Farm sausage products by August 2024 to be around 0.05 (5%). Next, let's consider the likelihood of the FDA issuing a recall for ground ginger products due to lead contamination. Lead contamination in spices, including ginger, has been a concern in the past, and the FDA has issued recalls for lead-contaminated spices before. However, the FDA also has measures in place to monitor and regulate the spice industry, which reduces the risk of contamination. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of the FDA issuing a recall for ground ginger products due to lead contamination by July 2024 to be around 0.03 (3%). To combine these probabilities, we need to assume that the events are independent, meaning that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event. Under this assumption, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since we assume independence, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B), so the formula simplifies to P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B). Plugging in our estimates, we get P(A or B) = 0.05 + 0.03 - 0.05 * 0.03 = 0.0765."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.05550725523086958, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.013876813807717395, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.32826029018915903, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current Political Climate: The political climate in the United States, particularly regarding abortion rights, has been highly polarized and contentious. Given the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022, there has been a significant push from pro-choice advocates to protect abortion rights at the state level. This could potentially lead to increased efforts to organize referendums on the issue. 2. Missouri's Abortion Laws: Missouri has been at the forefront of restricting abortion access, with the state legislature passing several laws limiting abortion rights. This could indicate a reluctance to hold a referendum that might enshrine protections for abortion rights. However, it could also galvanize pro-choice efforts to push for a referendum. 3. Referendum Process: The process of organizing a referendum in Missouri involves gathering signatures from registered voters to place the issue on the ballot. This process can be time-consuming and requires significant organizational effort. Given the timeframe (by August 2024), there is still sufficient time for such a process to be initiated and completed, assuming there is a concerted effort to do so. 4. Public Opinion and Activism: Public opinion in Missouri on abortion rights is likely divided, reflecting national trends. However, the energy and activism following the overturning of Roe v. Wade could potentially mobilize enough support for a referendum. The success of such efforts would depend on the ability of pro-choice groups to organize and garner enough support. Considering these factors, while there is a plausible scenario in which a referendum could be conducted (given the time frame and potential for organized effort), the political climate in Missouri and the hurdles involved in organizing a referendum suggest that it is not a certainty.

Event (a) - Central Bank of South Korea announcing a new digital payment system: South Korea has been actively exploring digital payment systems, and the central bank has expressed interest in developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Given the country's technological advancements and the central bank's interest in innovation, it is plausible that they might announce a new digital payment system within the given timeframe. Event (b) - Central Bank of Mexico announcing an interest rate cut: The Central Bank of Mexico has been maintaining a relatively high interest rate to combat inflation.

Firstly, China's economy has been experiencing a slowdown in recent years, which has led to a decrease in inflation rates. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global supply chains and led to increased prices for certain goods, which could contribute to higher inflation. Secondly, the People's Bank of China has been implementing expansionary monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, which could also lead to higher inflation. However, the bank has also been cautious not to overstimulate the economy, as it aims to maintain price stability. Thirdly, the question focuses on the month-over-month change in inflation, which can be volatile and subject to seasonal fluctuations. Therefore, it's possible that the inflation rate could exceed 0.5% in a single month, even if the overall trend is stable or declining. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of China's central bank's preferred inflation measure showing a monthly increase exceeding 0.5% by July 2024 is around 30%.

To assess the probability of the first event, we need to consider the political dynamics in Nigeria and the relationship between the Senate and President Tinubu. Without specific information on the current political climate, the likelihood of the Senate passing a bill opposed by the President is uncertain. However, given the general nature of political systems where the legislative and executive branches can have differing opinions, there is a plausible chance that such a bill could be passed, especially if it garners significant support from various stakeholders. Regarding the second event, the decision of Bayer to allow generic production of its cardiovascular drug depends on various factors, including patent laws, market competition, and the company's business strategy. Pharmaceutical companies often protect their patents vigorously to maintain market exclusivity and profit margins. However, they may also choose to allow generic production under certain circumstances, such as nearing the end of a patent's life cycle or as part of a strategic business move. Without specific details on the patent status of Bayer's cardiovascular drug or the company's current market position, it's challenging to estimate the likelihood of this event accurately. Given these considerations, the probability of either event occurring is difficult to quantify precisely without more specific information. However, considering the general possibilities and the timeframe provided, it seems reasonable to assign a moderate probability to the occurrence of either event. This is because both events, while uncertain, are within the realm of possibility given the dynamics of political and business decision-making."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.005982087593014551, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0014955218982536378, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1093696598149517, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historically, bumper harvests are relatively rare, as they require optimal conditions across a wide geographic area. Given the complexity of predicting weather patterns and the inherent variability in agricultural production, it's challenging to make precise predictions. However, we can look at historical trends and current conditions for some insight. In recent years, the United States has experienced a mix of favorable and unfavorable conditions for corn and soybean production. Factors such as climate change, which can lead to more extreme weather events, and advancements in agricultural technology and practices, which can improve resilience and yields, play significant roles.

Firstly, the WHO's criteria for declaring the end of an outbreak typically involve sustained reduction in cases over a significant period, adequate public health response, and low risk of further transmission. Given that the question does not specify the current status of the outbreak or the exact criteria the WHO is using to monitor it, we must rely on general principles. Historically, the WHO's declarations about outbreaks are based on careful assessment and typically occur after a period of sustained improvement. However, the unpredictability of infectious disease outbreaks, especially those involving vectors like mosquitoes (in the case of West Nile virus), means that declaring an end too early can be risky. Without specific data on the current trend of the West Nile virus outbreak, it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, given the general principles of how the WHO handles outbreak declarations and the time frame provided (approximately two months from the creation date to the resolution date), there are a few considerations: 1. Timeframe: August 2024 is about two months from the question's creation date. This is a relatively short timeframe for an outbreak to be completely resolved, especially considering the time needed for surveillance, confirmation of case reductions, and the decision-making process within the WHO. 2. WHO's Cautious Approach: The WHO tends to err on the side of caution when declaring the end of outbreaks to avoid premature declarations that could lead to complacency and resurgence. 3. Nature of West Nile Virus: West Nile virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, and its spread can be highly seasonal, influenced by weather conditions, and difficult to predict or control. This unpredictability might make the WHO cautious about declaring an end to the outbreak. Given these considerations, the probability of the WHO declaring the West Nile virus outbreak over by August 2024 seems relatively low, especially without knowing the current status of the outbreak.

However, we can look at general trends and the influence of economic indicators. In general, mortgage rates tend to follow the direction of long-term bond yields, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, due to the relationship between bond markets and mortgage-backed securities. When the economy is strong, and inflation is rising, interest rates tend to increase to combat inflation and slow down the economy. Conversely, in times of economic downturn or low inflation, interest rates are likely to decrease to stimulate the economy.

Firstly, the 15-year mortgage rate has been trending downward in recent months, driven by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions and market expectations. As of the current date (June 30, 2024), the average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is around 5.2% (according to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey). Given the current economic conditions and the Fed's stance on interest rates, it is plausible that the rate could fall below 5.0% by August 2024. Secondly, Jerome Powell's tenure as Federal Reserve Chair is set to expire in February 2026. While there have been some rumors about potential changes in the Fed's leadership, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that Powell will not remain in his position through July 2024. In fact, Powell has been reconfirmed by the Senate for a second term, which reduces the likelihood of his removal. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of both conditions being met as follows: Probability: 0.7. This probability reflects my assessment that the 15-year mortgage rate is likely to fall below 5.0% by August 2024 (around 60-70% chance) and that Jerome Powell will remain as Federal Reserve Chair through July 2024 (around 80-90% chance).

Without this information, it's challenging to estimate the likelihood of her announcing a running mate. 2. Location of the announcement: The question specifies that the announcement must be made at a rally in Miami, Florida. While Miami is a significant city in the United States, there is no particular reason to believe that Kamala Harris would choose this location for such an announcement. Politicians often choose locations for announcements based on strategic considerations, such as swing states or areas with high concentrations of supporters. 3. Timing of the announcement: The question requires the announcement to be made by August 31, 2024. The timing of such announcements can be difficult to predict, as they often depend on various factors, including the candidate's strategy, the election schedule, and external events. 4. Method of announcement: The question specifies that the announcement must be made by Kamala Harris herself during a rally. While this is a plausible scenario, politicians sometimes use other methods to announce their running mates, such as press conferences, social media, or televised events.

However, this does not necessarily mean that a referendum on enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution is imminent. In recent years, there have been efforts to amend the New Jersey state constitution to include abortion rights, but these efforts have been met with varying degrees of success.

(a) Missouri holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024: Abortion rights have been a highly contentious issue in the United States, especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. This has led to increased activism and political efforts at the state level to either restrict or protect abortion rights. Missouri has been at the forefront of this debate, with its own set of abortion restrictions and a history of political and social activism around the issue. Given the current political climate and the state's history, it's plausible that there could be efforts to organize a referendum.

First, let's consider the RBI's interest rate policy. The RBI has been closely monitoring the Indian economy and inflation rates. If the economy shows signs of slowing down or inflation rates decrease, the RBI might consider cutting interest rates to stimulate growth. However, if the economy remains strong and inflation rates remain high, the RBI might maintain or even increase interest rates. Given the uncertainty in the economy and the RBI's data-driven approach, it's difficult to predict with certainty whether they will cut interest rates.

In response to growing concerns and regulatory pressures, Oracle might announce measures to reduce its AI-related electricity consumption.

Considering the growing trend of companies prioritizing sustainability and reducing their environmental footprint, I would estimate the probability of Oracle announcing measures to reduce AI-related electricity consumption by July 2024 to be around 30%.

However, the specific requirements for this event (involving at least 1,000 workers, lasting at least one week, and being confirmed by official statements and reputable news sources) make it challenging to predict. The fact that Hyundai has resolved strikes in the past suggests that it is possible, but the timing and specifics of this event add uncertainty.

Firstly, it's important to note that the question does not specify what constitutes a 'significant alteration' of the decisions, which could lead to some ambiguity in the resolution. However, for the purpose of this analysis, we will assume that a significant alteration would require a substantial change to the decisions, such as reinstating stricter regulations on abortion providers or reinstating the second-trimester procedure ban. Given the current political climate and the fact that both Virginia and Florida have Republican-controlled legislatures, it's possible that there could be efforts to reverse the decisions. However, it's also important to note that the decisions were made by the state supreme courts, which are typically more insulated from political pressure than lower courts. In Virginia, the Supreme Court's decision was based on the state's constitution, which provides strong protections for individual rights. It's likely that the court would be hesitant to reverse its decision, especially given the potential backlash from abortion rights advocates. In Florida, the Supreme Court's decision was also based on the state's constitution, which provides similar protections for individual rights. However, Florida's legislature has been more aggressive in its efforts to restrict abortion access, which could potentially lead to a reversal of the decision. Overall, while there is a possibility that one or both of the decisions could be reversed, it's unlikely that both courts would reverse their decisions by July 2024.

While IBM has announced its plans for an AI-focused reorganization, the exact number of layoffs is not publicly confirmed.

Event (b) concerns Tiff Macklem remaining as the Governor of the Bank of Canada. As of the created date (June 30, 2024), Tiff Macklem is still serving as the Governor.

Given the current economic context, many central banks are reassessing their monetary policies in response to inflation and economic growth. Chile, being a significant economy in South America, may follow this trend. However, without specific information on Chile's current economic situation, monetary policy stance, and the Central Bank's intentions, it's challenging to make a precise prediction.

First, let's consider Chile's interest rate. The Central Bank of Chile has been raising interest rates in recent years to combat inflation, but the pace of rate hikes has slowed down in 2023. While it's possible that the bank may consider a rate cut in the future, it's not clear if it will happen by August 31, 2024. According to Bloomberg, the market expects the Central Bank of Chile to keep interest rates steady in the coming months. However, there is still a chance that the bank may surprise the market with a rate cut, especially if inflation continues to decline. Regarding Brazil's job growth, the country has been experiencing a slow economic recovery, and job growth has been modest. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the country added 34,000 jobs in May 2023, which is below the 50,000 threshold. While it's possible that job growth may pick up in the coming months, it's also possible that it may fall below 50,000 again. Given these considerations, I estimate that the probability of Chile announcing a rate cut by August 31, 2024, is around 20-30%. The probability of Brazil's job growth falling below 50,000 by July 31, 2024, is around 40-50%. Since the question resolves YES if either of these events occurs, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of these events happening. Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events, we get: P(YES) = P(Chile rate cut) + P(Brazil job growth < 50,000) - P(Chile rate cut and Brazil job growth < 50,000). Assuming that the two events are independent, we can estimate the probability of both events occurring as the product of their individual probabilities. Let's assume that the probability of both events occurring is around 10-20%. P(YES) = 0.25 + 0.45 - 0.15 = 0.55.

Secondly, the current economic situation in Brazil is characterized by moderate growth, with a GDP growth rate of around 2-3% in 2023. This growth rate is expected to continue in 2024, which could support job creation. However, there are also risks such as inflation, interest rates, and global economic uncertainty that could impact the labor market. Thirdly, the question specifies that revisions to previous months' data will not be considered for this question's resolution. This means that we need to focus on the initial job growth figures released by the IBGE, which may be subject to revision later. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Brazil's monthly job growth falling below 50,000 in any single month by July 2024 is relatively low, around 20-30%. This is because the current trend of job growth is positive, and the economy is expected to continue growing, albeit at a moderate pace. However, there are risks and uncertainties that could impact the labor market, and it's possible that job growth could slow down or even contract in certain months."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "a5f3966c-824c-4c69-b023-1af6c66bf999", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The Swiss National Bank announces an interest rate cut by August 2024 (b) Brazil's monthly job growth falls below 50,000 in any single month by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if both of the following conditions are met: (a) The Swiss National Bank officially announces an interest rate cut to take effect by August 31, 2024.

Current Economic Conditions: As of my last update in early 2024, the global economy was experiencing a slowdown, with many central banks considering or implementing monetary policy easing to counteract inflation concerns and support economic growth. The Swiss economy, being closely tied to the European and global economies, would likely be influenced by these trends. 2. Swiss National Bank's Monetary Policy Stance: Historically, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been cautious with its monetary policy, often prioritizing the stability of the Swiss franc and controlling inflation. However, in response to economic downturns or significant global monetary policy shifts, the SNB has shown willingness to adjust its policy rates. 3. Inflation and Economic Growth Forecasts: As of early 2024, inflation forecasts for Switzerland were generally within the SNB's target range, but there were concerns about the impact of global economic slowdown on Swiss growth. If inflation remains under control but growth slows significantly, the SNB might consider a rate cut to stimulate the economy. 4. Global Central Banks' Actions: The actions of other major central banks, especially the European Central Bank (ECB), can influence the SNB's decisions. If the ECB were to cut rates, it could create pressure for the SNB to follow suit to maintain competitiveness and manage the franc's value. Considering these factors, while there's a plausible scenario for the SNB to cut interest rates by July 2024 in response to global economic conditions and actions by other central banks, the decision is not certain.

(a) Indian economy avoiding a recession by July 2024: The Indian economy has been growing steadily, with a projected GDP growth rate of 6.5% to 7% for the fiscal year 2023-2024. However, the global economic outlook is uncertain, and there are concerns about the impact of a potential global recession on emerging markets like India. Nevertheless, India's diverse economy, large domestic market, and government initiatives to boost growth suggest a relatively lower likelihood of a recession in the short term. I estimate the probability of the Indian economy avoiding a recession by July 2024 to be around 0.7. (b) Swiss National Bank announcing an interest rate cut by July 2024: The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been maintaining a negative interest rate policy since 2015, with the current policy rate at -0.75%. The SNB has been cautious in its monetary policy decisions, and the likelihood of an interest rate cut depends on the evolution of the global economic outlook, inflation, and the Swiss franc's exchange rate.

To estimate the probability of both events occurring, we need to consider their potential correlation. The Indian economy's performance is not directly linked to the SNB's monetary policy decisions. However, both events are influenced by global economic trends. Assuming a moderate positive correlation between the two events (around 0.3), we can estimate the joint probability using the formula: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) + Corr(A, B) * sqrt(P(A) * (1-P(A)) * P(B) * (1-P(B))).

First, let's consider the Indian economy. As of the creation date (June 30, 2024), there is no clear indication that India is heading towards a recession. In fact, the Indian government has been taking steps to boost economic growth, and many experts predict that the country will continue to grow at a moderate pace. However, there are always uncertainties in economic forecasting, and unexpected events can occur. Given the current trends and forecasts, I would estimate the probability of the Indian economy avoiding a recession by July 2024 to be around 0.7. Second, let's consider the Swiss National Bank. As of the creation date, the SNB has not indicated any plans to cut interest rates. In fact, the SNB has been maintaining a tight monetary policy to combat inflation and stabilize the Swiss franc. However, the SNB is known to be data-driven, and if economic conditions were to deteriorate significantly, they might consider cutting interest rates.

Next, let's analyze the probability of Minnesota holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024.

Given that abortion rights are now protected by state law, it is less likely that a referendum will be held to address the same issue. However, it's not impossible that a referendum could still occur, especially if there are efforts to challenge or modify the existing law.

Event (a): Rome announces plans to restrict short-term rental units. Rome has been grappling with issues related to short-term rentals, such as overcrowding and rising housing costs. In recent years, several European cities have implemented regulations to restrict short-term rentals. Given the ongoing concerns and the trend of cities regulating short-term rentals, it's plausible that Rome might announce plans to restrict short-term rental units by July 2024. Event (b): The European Central Bank announces an interest rate cut. The ECB has been closely monitoring the economic situation in the Eurozone, and interest rates have been a key tool in responding to economic conditions.

These include economic indicators such as inflation, unemployment rates, and GDP growth, as well as monetary policy decisions by central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve in the United States. An increase in inflation, a strong labor market, or indications of a robust economy could lead to higher interest rates, as the Federal Reserve might increase the federal funds rate to control inflation and slow down the economy. Conversely, signs of economic slowdown or decreased inflation expectations could lead to stable or lower interest rates.

Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever common in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria, where it has caused significant outbreaks. The WHO has a set of criteria for declaring a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), which includes the risk of international spread, the potential for significant harm, and the need for international coordination. Given the information provided in the prompt, we do not have real-time data on the current status of the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria or any recent statements from the WHO regarding its emergency status. However, we can infer based on general knowledge that the WHO would likely declare an outbreak no longer a global emergency if the situation improves significantly, such as a substantial decrease in cases, improved public health response, or if the risk of international spread diminishes. Without specific information on the current outbreak situation or WHO's stance as of the question's creation date, it's challenging to provide a precise probability. However, considering the general criteria for declaring and de-escalating a global health emergency, we can make an educated guess. Given that Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and outbreaks are not uncommon, but also considering the WHO's proactive approach to managing public health emergencies, there's a reasonable chance the situation could improve to the point of de-escalation by August 2024, assuming effective public health interventions and no significant worsening of the outbreak.

To estimate this probability, we need to consider the likelihood of each event occurring separately and then combine them. First, let's consider the South Korean economy avoiding a recession by July 2024. The current economic indicators suggest that the South Korean economy is experiencing a slowdown, but it's still unclear whether it will enter a recession. The Bank of Korea has revised its growth forecast for 2024 downward, but it still expects the economy to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Additionally, the South Korean government has implemented various stimulus measures to support the economy. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of the South Korean economy avoiding a recession by July 2024 to be around 0.6. Second, let's consider the WHO declaring the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria no longer a global emergency by August 2024. The WHO has been monitoring the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria closely, and while the number of cases has been increasing, the organization has not yet declared it a global emergency. However, the WHO has been working with the Nigerian government to enhance surveillance, contact tracing, and case management. Additionally, the number of cases has been declining in recent weeks. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of the WHO declaring the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria no longer a global emergency by August 2024 to be around 0.4. Since the question is asking for the probability of either event occurring, we need to combine these probabilities. Assuming that the two events are independent, we can use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since we don't have information about the correlation between the two events, we'll assume that they are independent, and P(A and B) is approximately equal to P(A) * P(B). Therefore, the combined probability is: 0.6 + 0.4 - (0.6 * 0.4) = 0.84."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.03427586303785096, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00856896575946274, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.26258142825411185, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

That being said, since the ban has been blocked, it suggests that there are concerns about its constitutionality.

Condition (a) - The Singapore Straits Times Index reaches or exceeds 4,000 points: Historical data shows that the Singapore Straits Times Index has been steadily increasing over the years, with some fluctuations. Given the current economic trends and the index's past performance, it's reasonable to assume that the index has a good chance of reaching or exceeding 4,000 points by August 2024. However, market volatility and unforeseen events can impact the index's performance. Assuming a moderate growth rate and considering the index's historical fluctuations, I estimate the probability of the index reaching or exceeding 4,000 points by August 2024 to be around 0.6. Condition (b) - The World Health Organization declares the current bird flu outbreak over: The World Health Organization (WHO) has been closely monitoring the bird flu outbreak, and while it's difficult to predict exactly when the outbreak will be declared over, there are indications that the situation is being brought under control. The WHO has reported a decline in cases and has implemented measures to contain the outbreak. However, the WHO is cautious in declaring outbreaks over, and it may take time to ensure that the situation is fully under control. Considering the progress made so far and the WHO's cautious approach, I estimate the probability of the WHO declaring the bird flu outbreak over by August 2024 to be around 0.7. Combining the probabilities: To estimate the probability of both conditions being met, we need to multiply the individual probabilities. Assuming independence between the two events, the combined probability is: 0.6 (Condition a) \u00d7 0.7 (Condition b) = 0.42. The probability of both conditions being met is lower than the individual probabilities due to the uncertainty and potential correlations between the two events.

Firstly, we can look at the current state of the French economy. As of the latest available data, the French economy has been experiencing a slowdown, but it has not yet entered a recession. The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of France (INSEE) reported a growth rate of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2023, which is a slowdown compared to the previous quarter but still positive. Secondly, we can consider forecasts from reputable institutions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecasted a growth rate of 1.1% for France in 2023, which is a slight decrease from its previous forecast. The European Commission has also forecasted a growth rate of 1.1% for France in 2023. While these forecasts indicate a slowdown, they do not suggest a recession. Thirdly, we need to consider potential risks or challenges that could impact the French economy. One major risk is the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which could lead to higher energy prices and disrupt global supply chains. Another risk is the potential for a global economic downturn, which could impact French exports and economic growth.

As of my knowledge cutoff, there have been no recent announcements or indications from the state government or prominent political figures about plans for a healthcare access referendum. Next, I'll consider the typical process for initiating a referendum in Missouri. In Missouri, referendums can be initiated through a petition process, which requires gathering a certain number of signatures from registered voters. However, this process can be time-consuming and often takes several months to a year or more to complete. Given the relatively short timeframe until August 2024, it's unlikely that a referendum on healthcare access will be initiated and completed within the next few months. Additionally, there are no obvious catalysts or recent events that would suggest a sudden push for a healthcare access referendum in Missouri. Furthermore, I'll consider the broader context of healthcare policy in the United States. While healthcare access is a contentious issue, it's not typically addressed through state-level referendums.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI): The RBI's decision to cut interest rates depends on various factors, including inflation rates, economic growth, and global economic conditions. Given the current global economic trends, including inflation concerns and monetary policy tightening in many countries, it's challenging to predict a rate cut without specific data on India's economic performance closer to the resolution date. However, the RBI has shown a willingness to adjust monetary policy in response to economic conditions. Without current specific economic indicators or forward guidance from the RBI, it's difficult to assign a high probability to a rate cut. 2. Central Bank of Chile (CBC): Similar to the RBI, the CBC's decision would be based on Chile's economic performance, inflation expectations, and global economic trends. Chile has experienced economic challenges, including high inflation, which might suggest a less likely scenario for a rate cut. Central banks often hike rates to combat inflation, but the trajectory of inflation and economic recovery can influence decisions to cut rates. Given these considerations, predicting both banks will cut interest rates involves significant uncertainty.

To answer this question, we need to consider the current political and legal landscape in Texas and the United States. In May 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected the right to abortion nationwide. This decision allowed individual states to set their own abortion laws, leading to a wave of restrictive legislation in several states, including Texas. Texas's 6-week abortion ban, also known as Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), was enacted in September 2021 and has been in effect since then. Given the current political climate and the fact that the Texas state legislature is controlled by Republicans, who have been supportive of the ban, it is unlikely that the law will be repealed by the state legislature. Additionally, the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade suggests that the court is unlikely to invalidate the ban. However, there are ongoing legal challenges to the ban, and it is possible that a court ruling could invalidate the law. In November 2022, a federal appeals court heard arguments in a lawsuit challenging the ban, and a decision is still pending. If the court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, the ban could be overturned. Another factor to consider is the upcoming 2024 elections, which could potentially lead to changes in the Texas state legislature or the US Congress that could impact the ban. However, it is unlikely that any changes would occur in time to affect the ban's status by July 2024.

The likelihood of a listeria outbreak occurring in Columbus Craft Meats' products: This is difficult to estimate without specific data on the company's food safety record and manufacturing processes. However, listeria outbreaks can occur in any food processing facility, and it's not uncommon for companies to issue recalls due to contamination. 2.

However, given the recent trends and debates surrounding abortion rights in the United States, it is possible that Wisconsin might consider holding a referendum on this topic in the near future. To estimate the probability of a referendum being held by July 2024, we need to consider the following factors: 1. Political climate: The political climate in Wisconsin and the United States as a whole has been increasingly polarized on the issue of abortion rights. This could lead to increased pressure on lawmakers to hold a referendum. 2. Legislative support: The Wisconsin state legislature would need to approve a bill authorizing a referendum on abortion rights. As of now, there is no clear indication that such a bill has been introduced or is being considered. 3. Referendum process: Wisconsin has a specific process for holding referendums, which involves gathering signatures, obtaining approval from the state legislature, and scheduling the referendum. This process can be time-consuming and may not be completed by July 2024. 4. Recent events: There have been recent efforts in Wisconsin to restrict abortion access, which could potentially lead to a backlash and increased support for a referendum on enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution. Given these factors, it is difficult to estimate a high probability of a referendum being held by July 2024.

First, it's important to note that the question is specific about the location (San Francisco) and the method of announcement (at a rally). Given that Kamala Harris is from California and has strong ties to the state, it's plausible that she might choose to make a significant announcement like this in her home state. However, the specificity of the location (San Francisco) and the method (at a rally) narrows down the likelihood, as there are many other ways and places she could make such an announcement. Second, the political landscape and strategies can influence such decisions. Without current information on her campaign's plans or strategies regarding the announcement of a running mate, we have to rely on general practices. Typically, the announcement of a running mate is a significant event, and candidates often choose settings that maximize visibility and favorable coverage. A rally in a key state or a symbolic location is a common choice, but San Francisco, while significant to Harris, might not necessarily be the first choice for a national campaign event of this nature. Lastly, the timeframe (by August 2024) is relatively broad, giving ample opportunity for such an event to occur. However, the specificity of the announcement being made at a rally in San Francisco within this timeframe adds a layer of uncertainty. Given these considerations, while it's possible that Kamala Harris might announce her running mate at a rally in San Francisco, the specificity of the conditions (location and method of announcement) makes it less likely compared to a more general prediction about announcing a running mate by August 2024 without specifying the location or method."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "8a7d5abe-b795-4779-80f2-fae795c75023", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Wisconsin hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024 and (b) Kamala Harris announce her running mate at a rally in San Francisco by August 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following events occur: (a) Wisconsin officially conducts a statewide referendum specifically on the topic of enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution by July 31, 2024.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has been closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic globally, including in the Middle East. While the pandemic has been largely brought under control in many parts of the world, the Middle East has experienced a more complex situation due to various factors such as conflict, displacement, and vaccination challenges. However, in recent months, there have been significant efforts to increase vaccination rates and improve public health measures in the region. Several countries in the Middle East have made substantial progress in controlling the spread of the virus, and the number of new cases has been declining. Given this context, it is possible that the WHO may reassess the situation in the Middle East and consider declaring the outbreak no longer a global emergency by August 2024. However, it's also important to note that the WHO has been cautious in making such declarations in the past, and the organization may choose to maintain the current emergency status to ensure continued vigilance and preparedness. Additionally, the question requires the WHO to make a specific declaration about the Middle Eastern COVID-19 outbreak, which may not necessarily happen even if the situation improves significantly.

(a) Implementation of a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases in another U.S. state: Current Context: As of my last update, there's a growing trend towards stricter gun control measures in various states, partly influenced by public opinion shifts and recent events. However, the specific implementation of a 72-hour waiting period is less common and more politically contentious. Likelihood: Given the polarized nature of gun control debates in the U.S., the likelihood of another state implementing this specific measure by August 2024 is moderate. There are ongoing efforts in several states to enact stricter gun laws, but the specifics (like the exact duration of waiting periods) can be subject to political negotiations and might not always align with the 72-hour requirement. Thus, I'd estimate the likelihood of this event at around 0.4 (or 40%). (b) New York conducting a referendum on enshrining protection for abortion rights: Current Context: Following significant changes in federal abortion policies and state-level actions, there's a heightened interest in protecting abortion rights through state constitutions and laws. New York, being a state with strong Democratic control and a history of progressive policies, is a plausible candidate for such a move. Likelihood: Considering the political climate in New York and the national context, the likelihood of the state conducting a referendum focused on protecting abortion rights by August 2024 seems relatively high. However, the process of organizing a referendum (including legislative approval and timing) can be complex. I'd estimate the likelihood of this event at around 0.6 (or 60%). Combining the Likelihoods: To find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the individual probabilities. Thus, 0.4 (likelihood of another state implementing a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases) * 0.6 (likelihood of New York conducting a referendum on abortion rights) = 0.24.

Firstly, the United States has been focusing on diversifying its energy mix to reduce carbon emissions and meet climate goals. Nuclear energy, being a zero-carbon source, has garnered significant attention as a viable option. The current administration has expressed support for nuclear energy as part of its broader energy strategy. Secondly, the process of planning, approving, and constructing nuclear reactors is complex and time-consuming. It involves extensive regulatory approvals, public consultations, and significant financial investments. Given the timeframe of less than a year for the announcement and the subsequent planning phases, it seems ambitious to announce plans for additional reactors beyond the two currently planned. However, the U.S. government has shown willingness to accelerate the development of nuclear energy. There have been recent efforts to streamline the regulatory process and provide financial incentives for nuclear projects. This indicates a favorable environment for nuclear energy development.

Given the current political climate and the fact that North Carolina has a Republican-controlled legislature, it's possible that a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth could be enacted. However, it's also possible that any attempts to pass such a law could be met with resistance from Democratic lawmakers and advocacy groups. Assuming that there is a moderate level of political will to address this issue, I would estimate the probability of North Carolina enacting a new law modifying restrictions on medical care for transgender youth by July 2024 as 0.4. Condition 2: Maryland holds a referendum on abortion rights. Maryland has a reputation for being a liberal state, and abortion rights have been a contentious issue in the United States in recent years. Given the current political climate, it's possible that Maryland lawmakers could decide to hold a referendum on enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution. In fact, there have been efforts in Maryland to pass legislation protecting abortion rights, including a bill introduced in 2022 that would have enshrined the right to abortion in the state constitution. Although the bill did not pass, it suggests that there is interest in addressing this issue. Assuming that there is continued momentum on this issue, I would estimate the probability of Maryland holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024 as 0.6. Combined probability: To calculate the combined probability of both conditions being met, we need to multiply the individual probabilities. Probability of Condition 1: 0.4 Probability of Condition 2: 0.6 Combined probability: 0.4 x 0.6 = 0.24. Given the moderate level of political will to address transgender rights in North Carolina and the likelihood of Maryland lawmakers holding a referendum on abortion rights, I estimate that the combined probability of both conditions being met by July 2024 is 0.24."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "dcb4c4d1-8419-4af0-bd6e-5a983765be6b", "title": "Will either North Carolina enact a law modifying transgender youth medical care restrictions or Maryland hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if at least one of the following occurs by July 31, 2024: (a) North Carolina enacts a new law that modifies or replaces the current restrictions on medical care for transgender youth.

(a) Kamala Harris announcing her running mate at a rally in Portland by August 2024: This event is subject to various factors, including Harris's campaign strategy, the timing of the announcement, and the location of the rally. While Portland is a significant city, there is no strong indication that Harris would choose this specific location for such an announcement. Moreover, the requirement for the announcement to be made at a rally adds an extra layer of uncertainty. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of this event occurring as relatively low, around 0.2. (b) The United Auto Workers endorsing Joe Biden for president by July 2024: The UAW has historically endorsed Democratic presidential candidates, and Biden has been a strong supporter of labor unions throughout his career. Given the UAW's past behavior and Biden's labor-friendly stance, it is likely that the UAW will endorse him. However, the timing of the endorsement is uncertain, and it's possible that the UAW might delay their endorsement or choose not to endorse Biden at all. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of this event occurring as relatively high, around 0.7. Since the question resolves as YES if either part (a) or part (b) resolves as YES, we can calculate the overall probability by considering the probabilities of the two events. Assuming independence between the two events, the probability of at least one of them occurring is 1 minus the probability of neither occurring: P(YES) = 1 - P(a=NO \u2229 b=NO) = 1 - P(a=NO) \u00d7 P(b=NO) = 1 - (1-0.2) \u00d7 (1-0.7) = 1 - 0.8 \u00d7 0.3 = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76.

To estimate the probability of this event, let's consider the context and factors that might influence the outcome. 1. Current Political Climate: As of my last update, the political climate in the United States is highly polarized, with abortion rights being a contentious issue. Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, there has been a significant push by various states to either restrict or protect abortion rights. Washington state, known for its liberal leaning, has been proactive in protecting abortion rights. 2. Legislative Actions: Washington state has already taken steps to protect abortion access within its borders. In 2022, the state reinforced its commitment to abortion access, making it a haven for those seeking abortions from states with restrictions. Given this stance, it's plausible that further actions, such as a referendum, could be pursued to solidify these protections. 3. Public and Political Will: The will to protect abortion rights in Washington is evident from both the public and political sectors. The state's legislative actions and public statements from its leaders suggest a strong inclination towards ensuring access to abortion. A referendum would not only reflect this will but also serve as a direct measure of public opinion. 4. Logistical Feasibility: Conducting a referendum requires significant planning and resources. However, given the state's previous actions and the urgency felt by many to solidify abortion rights, it's feasible that such a process could be initiated and completed within the given timeframe. 5. Precedents and Comparative Analysis: Other states have held referendums on abortion rights, demonstrating that such actions are within the realm of possibility. Washington's political climate and previous actions on abortion suggest it could follow a similar path. Considering these factors, while there are no guarantees in political processes, the indicators suggest a favorable environment for such a referendum to occur.

As of the creation date (June 30, 2024), we do not have information about future economic conditions or the Central Bank's intentions. However, central banks often adjust interest rates in response to changing economic conditions, and it is possible that the Central Bank of Israel may reduce its key interest rate by August 2024. Without specific information, we can assume a moderate probability for this event. For event (b), the Reserve Bank of India imposing new regulatory curbs on HDFC Bank's lending practices depends on various factors such as the bank's performance, regulatory requirements, and the RBI's policies.

First, let's analyze the Central Bank of Israel's interest rate policy. The bank's key interest rate is currently at 4.75% (as of the Bank of Israel's most recent decision in May 2024). The Israeli economy has experienced high inflation rates in recent years, which might make an interest rate cut less likely. However, the Central Bank of Israel has a history of adjusting interest rates in response to economic conditions. Given the uncertainty in the global economy and potential future inflation trends, there is a possibility that the Central Bank of Israel might consider a rate cut by August 2024. Regarding the Reserve Bank of India, HDFC Bank has faced regulatory scrutiny in the past, particularly related to its asset quality and lending practices. The RBI has been actively monitoring the bank's operations and has taken steps to strengthen the overall banking sector. While it's possible that the RBI might impose new regulatory curbs on HDFC Bank's lending, there is no clear indication of such a move at this time. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the Central Bank of Israel announcing a reduction in its key interest rate by August 2024 is around 0.3 (or 30%). The probability of the Reserve Bank of India imposing new regulatory curbs on HDFC Bank's lending by August 2024 is approximately 0.2 (or 20%). Since these events are independent, we can calculate the probability of either event occurring as 1 - (probability of neither event occurring).

This demand is likely to continue in the coming years, making it an attractive market for battery manufacturers. Secondly, Ohio has been actively promoting itself as a hub for battery manufacturing, with several companies already having established facilities in the state. The state government has also offered incentives to attract more investment in the sector.

To answer this question, we need to consider the current political climate and the likelihood of such a referendum being held in the state. In recent years, there have been efforts to restrict abortion rights in Missouri, with the state passing several laws aimed at limiting access to abortion. However, there have also been efforts to protect and expand abortion rights, including a 2020 ballot initiative that amended the state constitution to guarantee the right to abortion.

However, it is also possible that such a referendum may not be held, especially if the state legislature or other political actors are opposed to it. To estimate the probability of a referendum being held, we can consider the following factors: 1. Public opinion: According to a 2020 survey, a majority of Missourians (54%) support legal access to abortion, while 41% oppose it. This suggests that there may be public support for a referendum on abortion rights. 2. Political climate: The Missouri state legislature has been controlled by Republicans in recent years, who have been instrumental in passing laws restricting abortion access. However, there are also Democrats in the legislature who have been working to protect and expand abortion rights. 3. Recent events: In 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which has led to renewed efforts to restrict abortion access in several states, including Missouri.

In Tennessee, labor laws have been a topic of discussion, particularly regarding workers' rights and unionization.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022 has led to a significant shift in abortion laws across the country. Many Republican-led states, including Florida, have implemented or attempted to implement more restrictive abortion laws. However, Florida's current law, which allows abortions up to 15 weeks, is relatively more permissive compared to some other states. Given the current political landscape in Florida, where Republicans hold a majority in the state legislature, there is a possibility that lawmakers might attempt to restrict abortion access further. However, it's also important to consider that the 15-week limit is already a relatively conservative stance, and it's unclear whether there would be sufficient support for more restrictive measures. Another crucial factor to consider is the potential for legal challenges. Abortion rights groups and other organizations might challenge the current law or any future restrictions in court, which could lead to changes or blockages in the implementation of new laws. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of Florida's abortion law remaining unchanged by August 2024 is relatively low. While it's possible that the law might remain in place, the current political climate and potential legal challenges suggest that changes are more likely."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6ebb3803-d2a7-4bba-a4fc-9dd8e6f0a15a", "title": "Will Wisconsin enact new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, Wisconsin enacts new laws or regulations that impose stricter requirements on abortion providers compared to other healthcare providers.

To answer this question, I will consider the current political climate and recent trends in abortion legislation in the United States. In recent years, there has been a surge in abortion restrictions in several states, particularly those with Republican-majority legislatures. Wisconsin, which has a Republican-controlled legislature and a Democratic governor, has seen several attempts to restrict abortion access in the past. However, the state's governor has vetoed several abortion restriction bills. Given the current political climate and the fact that the Republican-controlled legislature in Wisconsin has attempted to restrict abortion access in the past, it is possible that they may attempt to enact stricter regulations on abortion providers. However, the Democratic governor's veto power and the potential for legal challenges to any new regulations may limit the likelihood of such regulations being enacted. Additionally, the question requires that the new regulations be stricter than those for other healthcare providers, which may be a higher bar to clear. While some states have enacted targeted regulations on abortion providers, such as requiring them to have admitting privileges at local hospitals or to meet specific facility standards, these regulations are not always stricter than those for other healthcare providers.

As of my knowledge cutoff, Draghi is not the President of Italy, but rather Sergio Mattarella holds the position. However, it is possible that Draghi could become the President in the future.

Condition (a) requires the Brazilian economy to avoid a recession by July 2024. The Brazilian economy has been experiencing a slowdown in recent years, but it has not officially entered a recession. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics reported a GDP growth rate of 2.9% in 2022, and the forecast for 2023 and 2024 is around 1-2% growth. However, there are risks to this forecast, including high inflation, a large fiscal deficit, and external factors such as a global economic slowdown. Assuming a 20% chance of recession in the next year is reasonable, given these risks. Condition (b) requires the Hang Seng Index to reach or exceed 30,000 points by August 2024. The Hang Seng Index has been highly volatile in recent years, influenced by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, US-China trade tensions, and the performance of the Chinese economy. The index has reached as high as 31,000 points in the past, but it has also fallen to around 17,000 points during the pandemic. Currently, the index is around 20,000 points. To reach 30,000 points, the index would need to increase by around 50%. This is a significant increase, but it is not impossible, given the index's historical volatility. Assuming a 30% chance of the index reaching 30,000 points in the next year is reasonable, given the current market conditions and the index's historical performance. To combine these probabilities, we need to assume that the two conditions are independent. This is a reasonable assumption, as the Brazilian economy and the Hang Seng Index are influenced by different factors. Under this assumption, the probability of both conditions being met is the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore, the probability of both conditions being met is 0.8 (1 - 0.2, the probability of no recession) x 0.3 (the probability of the index reaching 30,000 points) = 0.24."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "dc626a08-8426-45d9-8a79-ed90563304bb", "title": "Will either the Brazilian economy avoid a recession by July 2024 or the Hang Seng Index reach or exceed 30,000 points by August 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if either of the following occurs: (a) The Brazilian economy does not enter a recession by July 31, 2024.

Their interest in sports media is evident from their previous collaborations and investments in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, which have applications in enhancing sports viewing experiences. This history suggests a likelihood of continued interest in sports media partnerships. 2. Sports Media Rights Landscape: The sports media landscape is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for rights. Major sports leagues and events are increasingly looking for innovative ways to broadcast their content, including through digital platforms. This creates an environment conducive to new partnerships. 3. Meta's Financial Capabilities and Strategic Directions: As a tech giant, Meta has the financial resources to invest in significant partnerships. Their strategic direction has been towards expanding their ecosystem beyond social media, into areas like e-commerce, VR, and more. A major sports media partnership could align with these goals. 4. Timing: The question specifies a resolution by July 2024, which is roughly a year from the creation date. This timeframe is plausible for negotiating and announcing a major partnership, considering the complexity and scale of such deals. 5. Competition and Market Trends: The market for sports media rights is highly competitive, with various tech companies, traditional broadcasters, and new entrants competing for deals. However, Meta's unique offerings, such as its VR capabilities and large user base, position it favorably for securing partnerships. Considering these factors, while there's no guarantee, the likelihood of Meta announcing a new major sports media partnership by July 2024 seems reasonable.

Given that the question does not provide information on the current status of the outbreak, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of the WHO declaring it no longer a global emergency by August 2024.

Current Political Climate: As of my last update in April 2023, the political landscape in the United States, including Wisconsin, has been quite polarized on abortion issues. This polarization often leads to legislative efforts to either restrict or protect abortion access. 2. Wisconsin's Abortion Laws: Wisconsin has a history of having restrictive abortion laws. For instance, it has a pre-Roe v. Wade ban on abortion that could potentially be enforced if Roe v. Wade is overturned or significantly weakened. This indicates a precedent for stricter regulations on abortion. 3. Legislative Activity: The question doesn't specify whether the regulations must be brand new or if amendments to existing laws count. Given the short timeframe (by July 2024), amending existing laws might be more feasible than passing entirely new legislation. Wisconsin's legislature has shown a willingness to engage with abortion-related legislation in the past. 4. Comparative Regulation: The key part of the question is whether the new regulations would be stricter for abortion providers than for other healthcare providers. Given the historical context and current political climate, it's plausible that efforts could be made to impose unique or stricter standards on abortion providers. 5. Timeframe: The resolution date is July 31, 2024. This provides a relatively short window for legislative action, especially considering the time needed for proposal, debate, and enactment.

In 2022, the Ohio Legislature passed a resolution to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would have prohibited the state from restricting or prohibiting abortion prior to fetal viability. Although this effort ultimately failed to make it onto the 2022 ballot due to procedural issues, it indicates ongoing political efforts to address abortion rights in the state. Given the recent activity and the relatively short timeframe until August 2024, there is a plausible chance that Ohio could move forward with a referendum focused on enshrining abortion rights protections. Virginia, on the other hand, has also seen significant political activity around abortion rights. In 2020, the state legislature passed the Reproductive Health Protection Act, which removed several abortion restrictions. However, the state's political landscape has shifted since then, with changes in the state legislature and governorship.

This implies that there is a clear motivation for both parties to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Secondly, the question specifies that the agreement must be publicly announced, officially confirmed by both parties, and reported by at least two major news outlets. This suggests that the agreement would need to be significant and substantial enough to warrant media attention, which could indicate a higher likelihood of a successful negotiation. However, it's also important to note that labor negotiations can be complex and contentious, and there are no guarantees of a successful outcome. The fact that the question specifies a specific deadline (August 2024) adds an element of uncertainty, as it's unclear whether both parties will be able to come to an agreement within the given timeframe.

Firstly, regarding Union Pacific and the train engineers' union, labor negotiations can be complex and unpredictable. However, given the specific focus on safety protocols, which is a critical aspect of the rail industry, there might be a reasonable chance of an agreement being reached. This is because safety is a priority for both the union and the company, and agreements on such matters are often seen as positive developments for all parties involved. Without specific information on the current state of negotiations or the relationship between Union Pacific and the union, it's difficult to assign a precise probability, but it seems plausible that an agreement could be reached within the timeframe. Secondly, concerning the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announcing an interest rate cut, the decision to cut interest rates is influenced by a broad range of economic indicators, including inflation, employment rates, and overall economic growth. As of my last update, I don't have real-time data on the current economic conditions in Australia, but generally, central banks adjust interest rates in response to economic conditions. If the Australian economy is experiencing or is forecasted to experience conditions that would typically prompt a rate cut (such as slowing growth or low inflation), then the probability of a rate cut would be higher. However, without current data, it's challenging to estimate this probability accurately. Given these considerations, the question essentially asks for the probability of at least one of these events happening, which is a bit easier to estimate than the probability of both happening. The probability of at least one event occurring is 1 minus the probability of neither event occurring. Without precise probabilities for each event, we must make a general assessment. Given the plausible nature of both events, especially considering the timeframe until August 2024, it seems reasonable to believe that at least one of these events could happen. However, without more specific information on the current negotiations between Union Pacific and the train engineers' union, or the current and forecasted state of the Australian economy, it's difficult to provide a highly confident estimate. Given these considerations, a rough estimate might lean towards a moderate to high probability for at least one of these events occurring by August 2024, simply due to the nature of the events and the timeframe provided.

According to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, as of December 2022, there were approximately 1.8 million individuals enrolled in Medicaid in Virginia. This number has been steadily increasing over the years, with a growth rate of around 10% per year. Assuming a similar growth rate, we can estimate the potential enrollment numbers for the Medicaid plan with work requirements. However, it's essential to note that the work requirement feature may affect enrollment numbers, as some individuals may choose not to enroll or may not meet the work requirements. Secondly, we need to consider the rate of enrollment. The plan was implemented in 2019, and since then, the enrollment numbers have been steadily increasing. However, the rate of enrollment may slow down over time as the eligible population decreases. Lastly, we need to consider any potential challenges or changes to the plan. The plan has faced legal challenges in the past, and there is always a possibility of federal interventions or changes to the plan's structure or implementation. However, as of the knowledge cutoff in 2023, there are no significant challenges or changes that would affect the plan's enrollment numbers. Based on these factors, it's difficult to estimate the exact enrollment numbers for the Medicaid plan with work requirements. However, considering the overall Medicaid enrollment numbers and the growth rate, it's possible that the plan could enroll at least 25,000 beneficiaries by July 2024."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "b9823857-909c-46ec-aea2-c330dec48d37", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Minnesota holds a referendum on labor union laws by August 2024 and (2) Virginia's Medicaid plan with work requirements enrolls at least 25,000 beneficiaries by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if both of the following occur: (1) By August 31, 2024, Minnesota officially conducts a public referendum specifically focused on labor union laws.

The adoption process can be lengthy and is subject to various political and bureaucratic factors. 3.

To estimate the probability of this event, we need to consider several factors. Firstly, the French government has been actively promoting the use of biofuels as part of its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet its climate goals. In 2018, France set a target of increasing the share of biofuels in its transportation sector to 15% by 2030. Given this policy context, it is likely that the French President's Office would continue to support the adoption of biofuels in its official fleet. Secondly, the question specifies that the announcement must come from official channels or be reported by at least two major, reputable news outlets. This suggests that the announcement would need to be a formal and public declaration, rather than a internal decision or a rumor. This requirement increases the credibility of the announcement and makes it more likely to be taken seriously. Thirdly, the question does not specify what type of vehicles are being converted to biofuel, nor does it provide any information about the current state of the presidential fleet. However, given the French government's commitment to reducing emissions, it is possible that the presidential fleet may already include some vehicles that run on biofuel. If this is the case, then the announcement of additional conversions would be a natural extension of existing policies. Finally, the question provides a relatively long timeframe for the announcement to be made, with a deadline of July 31, 2024. This allows for the possibility that the French President's Office may make the announcement at any point over the next year, rather than requiring it to happen immediately. Taking these factors into account, I estimate that the probability of the French President's Office announcing the conversion of additional vehicles to biofuel by July 2024 is around 60%.

Given the complexity and specificity of these events, it is challenging to estimate the probability of both occurring by July 2024. However, we can break down the problem into smaller components and assess the likelihood of each event individually. Event (a) - Spain announces plans to build additional nuclear reactors: Spain has been exploring ways to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and increase its use of renewable energy sources. In 2020, the Spanish government announced plans to build two new nuclear reactors, and there have been discussions about potentially building more in the future. However, the decision to build additional reactors would require significant political and public support, as well as regulatory approvals.

Event (b) - French President's Office announces conversion of additional vehicles to biofuel: The French government has been promoting the use of biofuels as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. In 2020, the French President's Office announced plans to convert some of its vehicles to biofuel, and there have been reports of additional conversions since then. However, the pace of these conversions is uncertain, and it is unclear whether the French President's Office will announce additional conversions by July 2024. I would estimate the probability of event (b) occurring by July 2024 as 0.3. Since both events must occur for the question to resolve as YES, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event.

For Spain, there have been discussions about increasing nuclear energy capacity, but no concrete plans have been officially announced beyond the two reactors currently planned. The Spanish government has been focusing on renewable energy sources, and while nuclear energy is part of their energy mix, there's been no strong indication of an imminent announcement for additional reactors.

Given these hurdles, I would estimate the probability of Arkansas holding a referendum on abortion rights by July 2024 to be around 0.2. Next, let's consider the likelihood of Kentucky holding a referendum on pension reform by August 2024. Pension reform has been a contentious issue in Kentucky, and there have been efforts to address it through legislation. However, putting a referendum on the ballot would require significant political will and coordination. While it's possible that a referendum could be organized, it's not clear whether there is sufficient momentum or support for such an effort. I would estimate the probability of Kentucky holding a referendum on pension reform by August 2024 to be around 0.3. To combine these probabilities, we need to consider the fact that the question will resolve as YES if either event occurs. This means we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since the events are independent, we can assume that P(A and B) is approximately 0. Therefore, the combined probability is approximately 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.11823408418517278, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.029558521046293196, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4914292251821706, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, as of my last update in April 2023, the U.S. labor market was strong, with low unemployment rates and a high level of job openings. However, economic conditions can change rapidly due to various factors such as inflation, interest rates, global events, and policy changes. Historically, the number of weekly initial jobless claims can fluctuate based on economic conditions. During strong economic periods, claims tend to be lower, while during recessions or periods of economic downturn, claims increase. The threshold of 250,000 is somewhat elevated but not extraordinarily high compared to historical standards. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, jobless claims skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, often exceeding 1 million per week. However, in healthier economic times, claims have often hovered around or below 250,000. Given the current strong labor market conditions and assuming no major economic downturns or external shocks by August 2024, the likelihood of jobless claims exceeding 250,000 for four consecutive weeks seems relatively low. However, the economy is inherently unpredictable, and factors such as inflation, monetary policy adjustments, or unforeseen global events could impact the labor market.

Condition (b) requires an Indiana state court to declare the near-total abortion ban constitutional by August 31, 2024.

For event (a), the UAW has historically endorsed Democratic candidates, and as of the question's creation date (June 30, 2024), the most likely candidate fitting this description is Hillary Clinton, who has not yet announced her candidacy but has been rumored to be considering it.

First, the current state of the outbreak: As of the knowledge cutoff in 2023, mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) was still present globally, but with varying levels of outbreak severity in different regions. Argentina, like many countries, had reported cases, but without specific details on the current situation, it's hard to gauge the exact status. Second, the criteria for declaring an outbreak over: This typically involves sustained reduction in case numbers over a specified period, usually several weeks to a few months, depending on the disease and local health guidelines. Given the relatively short timeframe until July 2024, a significant and rapid decline in cases would be necessary for such a declaration. Third, the role of health authorities and the WHO: Both national health authorities and the WHO have protocols for declaring outbreaks over, which include not just the number of cases but also the effectiveness of public health responses, vaccination efforts, and surveillance capabilities. A declaration by either entity would carry significant weight. Fourth, the influence of vaccination and public health measures: The availability and uptake of vaccines, as well as adherence to public health guidelines, play crucial roles in controlling outbreaks. Positive trends in these areas would increase the likelihood of a declaration. Given these considerations and without current, detailed data on the outbreak's status in Argentina, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

On the one hand, there have been efforts in recent years to increase transparency and accountability in the administrative law judge system, which could suggest that an ethics code is a possibility. For example, the Social Security Administration has implemented rules requiring administrative law judges to disclose certain information about their cases, and there have been calls for greater transparency in the system.

Current Legal Landscape: As of my last update, Mississippi has a 6-week abortion ban in place. This ban was enacted in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and returned the regulation of abortion to the states. 2. Legislative Repeal: The likelihood of the Mississippi state legislature repealing the ban seems low. The ban was enacted by the same legislature that is currently in power, indicating a strong stance against abortion access. Without a significant shift in the political composition of the legislature or a substantial change in public opinion that influences legislative action, repeal is unlikely. 3. Judicial Invalidation: The possibility of the ban being invalidated by a court ruling is more plausible but still faces significant hurdles. Challenges to similar bans in other states have had mixed results, with some being upheld and others being blocked or overturned. However, the legal landscape is complex, and the outcome of such challenges is difficult to predict. Given the conservative lean of the judiciary in Mississippi and the federal courts' current stance on abortion, the likelihood of the ban being invalidated by a court is uncertain. 4. Public and Political Pressure: Public opinion and political pressure can influence both legislative and judicial outcomes. However, given the deeply polarized nature of the abortion debate in the United States and the specific political leanings of Mississippi, significant enough pressure to overturn the ban might not materialize by July 2024. 5. Timeframe: The question specifies a resolution by July 31, 2024. This timeframe allows for some legal challenges to proceed or for legislative sessions to potentially address the issue, but it is a relatively short window for significant legal or political changes to occur. Considering these factors, the probability of Mississippi's 6-week abortion ban being overturned by July 2024 seems low.

To estimate the probability of either event occurring, we need to consider the current political climate, the likelihood of legislative or judicial action, and the time frame provided for the events to occur. Establishing an enforceable ethics code for U.S. administrative law judges requires a formal adoption process, which involves multiple stakeholders and can be a complex and time-consuming process. Given the current political polarization in the United States, it is challenging to predict the likelihood of such a code being adopted. However, the fact that the code must be legally binding and applicable to all sitting administrative law judges suggests that it would require significant bipartisan support or a strong push from a single party with a majority in both the House and Senate. The probability of this event occurring by July 2024 is uncertain but seems relatively low due to the complexity of the process and the current political climate. On the other hand, the overturning of Mississippi's 6-week abortion ban involves either a repeal by the state legislature or a court ruling. Given the current composition of the U.S. Supreme Court and the ongoing debates around abortion rights, it is difficult to predict the likelihood of a court ruling overturning the ban.

The probability of this event occurring by July 2024 is also uncertain but seems relatively higher than the establishment of an ethics code, given the ongoing legal challenges and public debate around abortion rights.

(a) The Arkansas Senate passing a total abortion ban: Arkansas has a Republican-controlled legislature and has been trending conservative. In 2021, the state passed a 'trigger law' that would ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned. Given the current political climate and the state's previous actions, it's plausible that the Arkansas Senate might pass a total abortion ban. However, it's essential to note that the legislative process can be unpredictable, and there might be opposition or delays. Still, considering the state's conservative leanings, I'd estimate the probability of this event occurring as relatively high, around 0.7. (b) Virginia holding a referendum on abortion rights: Virginia has been trending Democratic, and the state has taken steps to protect abortion rights in recent years. In 2021, the state repealed its abortion restrictions, and in 2022, the Democratic-controlled state Senate passed a constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion rights. However, the amendment needs to be passed again in the 2024 legislative session and then approved by voters in a referendum. While there is a strong likelihood of the amendment passing the legislature, the outcome of the referendum is less certain. Virginia voters have been supportive of abortion rights in the past, but the outcome of a referendum can be influenced by various factors, such as voter turnout and campaign efforts. I'd estimate the probability of Virginia holding a referendum on abortion rights as relatively high, around 0.8.

(a) The Arkansas Senate passing a total abortion ban by July 31, 2024: Legislative Environment: Arkansas has a history of passing restrictive abortion laws. In 2021, it passed Act 309, which banned nearly all abortions in the state, with exceptions for cases involving rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life, although this law was put on hold due to legal challenges. This indicates a legislative inclination towards stricter abortion laws. Current Political Climate: The political climate in Arkansas is conservative, which generally aligns with stricter abortion policies. The state has a Republican-dominated legislature and governorship, suggesting that there would be political will to pass such legislation. Previous Attempts and Challenges: While there have been attempts to pass strict abortion laws, legal challenges have been a significant hurdle. The success of such legislation passing and being enacted by July 31, 2024, would depend on overcoming these legal barriers or the Supreme Court's stance on similar laws. (b) Virginia holding a referendum on abortion rights by August 31, 2024: Legislative and Political Climate: Virginia has a more liberal stance on abortion compared to Arkansas, with a Democratic-dominated legislature and governorship. This political climate is less likely to support a total abortion ban but might support enshrining abortion rights into the state constitution. Recent Actions: There have been efforts in Virginia to protect abortion rights, especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. However, the process of putting a constitutional amendment to a referendum involves a multi-step process that includes approval by two consecutive sessions of the General Assembly before it can be put to a public vote. Given these considerations: For (a), while there is political will and a history of attempting to pass strict abortion laws in Arkansas, the legal challenges and the specific timeframe make it somewhat uncertain. However, given the state's political leanings, it's plausible. For (b), the process in Virginia for holding a referendum is more complex and time-sensitive. Given the requirement for approval by two consecutive sessions of the General Assembly, the likelihood of meeting the August 2024 deadline seems lower. Considering both scenarios, while there are plausible paths for each, the overall probability seems to lean more towards the Arkansas scenario due to the state's political climate and history of attempting to pass strict abortion laws.

To estimate the probability of this question resolving YES, we need to consider both events separately and then combine them. Firstly, regarding Barclays Bank issuing pass-through certificates, it is difficult to predict with certainty what actions a specific bank will take in the future. However, banks frequently engage in loan sales and issuance of securities as part of their portfolio management and funding strategies. Given the large size of Barclays Bank and its active involvement in financial markets, it is plausible that they might issue pass-through certificates worth at least $1 billion within the given timeframe. However, without specific information on their current strategies or plans, this remains speculative. Secondly, concerning the U.S. economy avoiding a recession by July 2024, predicting economic downturns is inherently challenging due to the complex interplay of various factors, including policy decisions, global events, and consumer behavior. As of my last update, there were concerns about a potential recession, but economic forecasting is highly uncertain. The definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth provides a clear benchmark, but whether the U.S. economy will meet this criterion by July 2024 is uncertain. Given these considerations, estimating a precise probability is challenging. However, considering the flexibility in the question (either event happening leads to a YES resolution), the likelihood of at least one of these events occurring seems higher than the likelihood of neither occurring. Barclays Bank's actions are somewhat predictable based on common banking practices, and the U.S. economy's performance, while uncertain, has mechanisms (like monetary policy) that can be leveraged to mitigate a recession. Therefore, considering the dual nature of the question and the inherent uncertainties in both financial and economic forecasting, I would estimate the probability of the question resolving YES to be higher than 50%, reflecting a belief that at least one of the conditions will be met, but not with absolute certainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0015422485426153099, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00038556213565382746, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0556070674401089, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to regulate or ban abortion. However, this decision does not necessarily mean that all state-level abortion bans will be deemed constitutional. 2. Iowa's legal framework: Iowa has a Republican-controlled legislature and a conservative judicial system, which may be more likely to uphold the ban. However, the state's constitution also has provisions that could be interpreted as protecting reproductive rights. 3.

The legal landscape concerning abortion is complex and has seen significant shifts, especially following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v.

The requirement for adoption by the United States government and confirmation by major news outlets adds another layer of complexity, as it involves not just the passage of legislation but also its implementation and recognition by the media. Given these factors, while there is a clear rationale for why such a code should be established, the practicalities of achieving this by the specified deadline make it challenging.

In 2019, the state passed a 'fetal heartbeat' bill, which banned abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around six weeks into pregnancy.

While there have been efforts to restrict abortion access in the state, it's unclear whether stricter regulations will be enacted by July 2024.

Given this trend and the ongoing political debates, it's possible that Michigan could remove the work requirement by July 2024. Let's assign a probability of 0.5 to this event.

Next, let's consider the likelihood of Wisconsin conducting a referendum on abortion rights by August 2024. Wisconsin has been at the forefront of the abortion debate in recent years, with the state's Republican-controlled legislature passing several restrictive abortion laws. However, the process of getting a referendum on the ballot in Wisconsin also requires significant support from lawmakers or citizens.

These factors can influence employment rates and jobless claims. 2. Historical Context of Jobless Claims: Typically, weekly jobless claims below 300,000 are considered a sign of a strong labor market. However, claims can fluctuate based on seasonal adjustments, economic conditions, and one-time events. The threshold of 275,000 for two consecutive weeks indicates a slight weakening in the labor market but still within a relatively healthy range. 3. Potential Future Economic Conditions: Predicting economic conditions by August 2024 involves considering the potential for continued economic growth, recession, or stabilization.

Assuming the strike has not been fully resolved by the time of the question's creation (June 30, 2024), I would estimate the probability of the strike continuing through August 2024 at around 50%. To calculate the overall probability of both events occurring (i.e., the question resolving YES), we need to multiply the individual probabilities.

(a) The Italian economy: Predicting economic growth or recession is inherently uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors, including global economic trends, political stability, and external shocks. However, as of my last update, there wasn't clear evidence suggesting Italy was headed for a recession, but the global economic outlook was cautious due to various geopolitical and economic factors. Without specific data or forecasts from the Italian National Institute of Statistics available at the time, it's challenging to make a precise prediction. However, given the generally cautious outlook for many economies, let's conservatively estimate the probability of Italy avoiding a recession as less than certain but still relatively high, considering the question's specific criteria for recession. (b) Norwegian oil workers' strike: The status of labor disputes can change rapidly and is influenced by negotiations, government intervention, and the strategic interests of both workers and employers. Without current information on any ongoing strikes or disputes as of my last update, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of workers remaining on strike through August 2024. Strikes in critical industries like oil can have significant economic impacts, so there's often pressure to resolve them. However, the resolve of the workers, the stance of the employers, and government intervention can all influence the outcome. Given these uncertainties, the probability of this event is also challenging to estimate but might be considered lower than the economic scenario due to the potential for resolution through negotiation or other means. Given these considerations, the overall probability of the question resolving YES seems to lean more towards the Italian economy's performance, as it represents a broader and perhaps more stable set of factors compared to the unpredictable nature of labor disputes. However, without specific data or updates on the current economic situation in Italy or the status of Norwegian oil workers, these assessments are highly speculative."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04783326060372439, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.011958315150931098, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.31091839290429074, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Firstly, the average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage has been increasing due to rising inflation and interest rates. As of the current date (June 30, 2024), the average rate is already around 5.3%. Given the current economic conditions, it is likely that the rate will continue to rise, potentially exceeding 5.5% by August 2024. Secondly, the Bank of Canada has been raising its key interest rate to combat inflation. However, if the economy shows signs of slowing down, the Bank of Canada may consider reducing its key interest rate to stimulate growth. Since the question resolves on August 31, 2024, there is a possibility that the Bank of Canada may announce a rate reduction by then, especially if economic indicators suggest a need for monetary policy easing. However, it is essential to note that both conditions need to be met for the question to resolve as YES. The Bank of Canada's decision to reduce its key interest rate is uncertain and depends on various economic factors.
