Given the increasing focus on AI safety and transparency, I might estimate this probability to be moderately high, say around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This is the complement of P, so it will be 1 - P. If P is 0.65, then not_P will be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Expected report release)**: This is closely related to P and might have a similar probability, as it essentially asks the same question in different wording. Therefore, I could also estimate this at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (US conducts a nuclear test)**: The likelihood of the US conducting a nuclear test explosion before 2030 is likely low, considering international treaties and the current geopolitical climate. I might estimate this probability at around 0.15.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: To estimate this, I would consider the independence of P and Q. If I assume P and Q are independent, I would calculate it as P * Q, leading to a value of 0.65 * 0.15 = 0.0975.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This would be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, it would be 0.65 + 0.15 - 0.0975 = 0.7025.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducts a nuclear test and OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This would also be calculated assuming independence, leading to Q * not_P = 0.15 * 0.35 = 0.0525.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (US conducts a nuclear test given OpenAI publishes a report)**: This conditional probability may be influenced by the publication of the report; however, given the nature of the questions, I might estimate this at a value reflecting the likelihood of Q occurring regardless of P, perhaps around 0.1.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that these estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, Q, and their combinations.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.10 - 0.15 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.15 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.65, 0.15) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.15) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.15) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.10 / 0.10 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_3 consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.7, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-26T00:06:33.973919", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('e4dc97fa-11b7-4932-b396-528b1a7f6934'), title='Will OpenAI publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c689dd4b-8086-4457-b9f5-27f6729aa7e6'), title='Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('74de38a2-db42-46d1-9646-cd392079201b'), title=\"Is OpenAI expected to release a report detailing the findings from an external assessment of their models' safety by June 30, 2024?\", body='This question will be considered **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI issues a *public* report containing the findings from an *independent* party evaluating the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('2afc0794-f14d-458e-8499-85b27de15eeb'), title='Will the US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively to verification of a nuclear explosion by the CTBTO, the UN, or if an official government statement from the US is issued confirming the test.

The two primary events are whether OpenAI will publish a report on external red-teaming by June 30, 2024 (P) and whether the US will conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030 (Q). \n\n1. **P (OpenAI Report)**: Given the context of increasing scrutiny on AI safety, I estimate a moderate probability that OpenAI will publish such a report. This is influenced by their commitment to transparency and safety in AI development. \n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P. If P has a probability of 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30, reflecting the likelihood that OpenAI will not publish the report.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is essentially rephrasing P, so I expect it to have a similar probability estimate as P, as it pertains to the same event.\n\n4. **Q (US Nuclear Test)**: The likelihood of the US conducting a nuclear test before 2030 is influenced by geopolitical factors and current treaties. Given the current global climate, I estimate a lower probability for Q, reflecting the general trend towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This probability reflects the likelihood that both events occur. Given that Q is less likely than P, P_and_Q would be calculated based on the estimated probabilities of P and Q, taking into account their potential correlation.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This represents the probability that at least one of the events occurs. Given that P is more likely than Q, I would expect P_or_Q to be higher than both individual probabilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This considers the scenario where the US conducts a nuclear test but OpenAI does not publish the report. This would be a less likely scenario since Q is less probable than P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. Given that these events are somewhat independent, I would estimate this to be lower than the unconditional probability of Q.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the estimates adhere to the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and the conditional probabilities. I will also ensure that the estimates reflect realistic probabilities based on current events and trends.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.14,\nP_or_Q: 0.76,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.76 + 0.14 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.14 <= min(0.70, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.20) <= 0.76 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.76 - 0.06 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.14 / 0.20 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\n\nand consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.14,\nP_or_Q: 0.74,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.13107742334259087, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.06553871167129544, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5285465537879277, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This leads me to estimate P at around 0.65.\n\n**not_P (OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This is simply the complement of P, so not_P would be 0.35.\n\n**para_P (OpenAI expected to release a report)**: Since para_P is essentially a rephrasing of P, I will assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n**Q (US conducts a nuclear test)**: The likelihood of the US conducting a nuclear test is relatively low, given historical context and current treaties. I estimate Q at about 0.15.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both events happening should be lower than either event happening alone. Given my estimates, I would assign P_and_Q a value of 0.10.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This should be higher than either event alone, so I estimate P_or_Q at around 0.70, considering that it captures the possibility of either event occurring.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (US conducts a nuclear test and OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This is a specific scenario where the nuclear test occurs but the report does not. I estimate this at 0.05, reflecting the low probability of both conditions being met.\n\n**Q_given_P (US conducts a nuclear test given OpenAI publishes a report)**: This is a conditional probability that may be influenced by the first event. I estimate this at 0.20, reflecting some likelihood that if OpenAI does publish a report, it might correlate with increased military activity, though it remains low overall.\n\nIn summary, I expect these events to have interdependent probabilities, particularly P, not_P, and para_P, while Q, P_and_Q, Q_and_not_P, and Q_given_P are influenced by external conditions.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.20,\npara_P: 0.65\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.10 - 0.15 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.15 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.65, 0.15) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.15) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.15) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.10 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.20,\npara_P: 0.60\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "952c295b-bf5e-4aeb-8cb7-5b6c5ccab7d0", "title": "Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T05:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-26T00:06:30.415116", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('e4dc97fa-11b7-4932-b396-528b1a7f6934'), title='Will OpenAI publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c689dd4b-8086-4457-b9f5-27f6729aa7e6'), title='Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('74de38a2-db42-46d1-9646-cd392079201b'), title=\"Is OpenAI expected to release a report detailing the findings from an external assessment of their models' safety by June 30, 2024?\", body='This question will be considered **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI issues a *public* report containing the findings from an *independent* party evaluating the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('2afc0794-f14d-458e-8499-85b27de15eeb'), title='Will the US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively to verification of a nuclear explosion by the CTBTO, the UN, or if an official government statement from the US is issued confirming the test.

The relationship between these events is important for making accurate probability estimates. \n\n1. **P**: The probability that OpenAI publishes a report is influenced by their commitment to transparency and external safety evaluations. Given the increasing scrutiny of AI safety, I estimate this probability to be moderately high, around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P, so it will be 1 - P, which would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This is similar to P and represents the expectation of releasing a report by OpenAI. Given that it's essentially the same question, I would assign it the same probability as P, which is also 0.65.\n\n4. **Q**: The probability of the US conducting a nuclear test is more uncertain due to geopolitical factors and public scrutiny. I estimate this to be lower, around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This is the joint probability of both events occurring. Given that both events are somewhat independent but not entirely, I would estimate this at a lower probability, say 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This is the probability that at least one of the events occurs.

Therefore, P_and_Q would be 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. So, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducts a nuclear test, OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This would also be P(Q) * P(not_P) = 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given OpenAI publishes a report, will the US conduct a nuclear test?)**: This is a conditional probability that would likely be higher than Q alone, but I would estimate it at 0.25, as the publication of a report might influence the US's actions. \n\nIn summary, the relationships between these events are crucial. P and Q are independent, but they influence the combined probabilities for P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P.

The predictions regarding these events will be influenced by various factors, including current trends in AI safety practices and geopolitical dynamics surrounding nuclear testing.\n\n**P (OpenAI publishing the report)**: The likelihood of OpenAI publishing a report by the specified date could be influenced by their commitment to transparency and the increasing pressure for accountability in AI development. Given the current trajectory of AI governance and the importance of safety, I would estimate a moderate to high probability of this occurring.\n\n**not_P (OpenAI not publishing the report)**: This is simply the complement of P, so it will be directly related to the probability of P. If P is estimated at a certain probability, not_P will be 1 minus that probability.\n\n**para_P (Expected release of a report)**: This question is closely related to P. Since they are essentially asking the same thing, I would expect para_P to have a similar probability to P.\n\n**Q (US conducting a nuclear test)**: The probability of the US conducting a nuclear test before 2030 is influenced by international treaties, domestic policy, and the current geopolitical climate. Given the historical context and current global nuclear non-proliferation efforts, I would estimate a lower probability of this occurring compared to P.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring is likely to be lower than either event occurring independently, as they are not directly related events. Thus, I would estimate this to be a product of their individual probabilities.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability will be higher than either individual event, as it accounts for the occurrence of either event. It will be calculated using the probabilities of P and Q.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while P does not)**: This is a more complex relationship, as it requires both conditions to be met, and thus will likely have a lower probability than Q alone.\n\n**Q_given_P (Q occurring given P)**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true. Given that these events are somewhat independent, I would expect this probability to be lower than Q itself but still significant.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are crucial for ensuring that the probabilities adhere to the consistency rules. For instance, the relationship between P and not_P must be complementary, while P_and_Q and P_or_Q must adhere to the rules of conjunction and disjunction respectively.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09431067947124139, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047155339735620694, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44426165831931935, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Factors influencing this could include internal assessments, regulatory pressures, or public demand for transparency regarding AI safety. \n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This is the complement of P and would occur if OpenAI fails to publish the report by the deadline. The probability assigned to this event will be inversely related to the probability of P. \n\n3. **para_P (Expected to release a report)**: This question is similar to P and should have a similar probability since it is asking about expectations regarding the same event. \n\n4. **Q (US conducts a nuclear test explosion)**: This event is influenced by geopolitical factors and international treaties. The likelihood of the US conducting a nuclear test is relatively low given the current global stance against nuclear testing, but it's not impossible, hence a moderate probability. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring is likely to be lower than either event occurring individually, as they are independent events. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This probability should be higher than the individual probabilities of P and Q, reflecting that either could happen independently. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducts a nuclear test while OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This scenario might have a nuanced probability since it requires both conditions to be true, which might be less likely than either happening alone. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (If OpenAI publishes, will the US conduct a nuclear test?)**: This is a conditional probability and would depend on the implications of OpenAI's publication on US policy regarding nuclear testing. \n\nIn summary, the probabilities assigned to these events must be consistent with one another, particularly regarding the relationships defined in the consistency rules, such as the negation, conjunction, and disjunction of events.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.58,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.15 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.58 is FALSE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "65da20ac-c384-4223-a73a-c55009b79efe", "title": "Will Doug Burgum not be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Doug Burgum is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given the current trend towards more transparency in AI development, I would estimate a moderate to high probability for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P has a high probability, then not_P must have a correspondingly low probability. \n\n3. **para_P (OpenAI expected to release a report)**: This is closely related to P, and I would expect it to have a similar probability, as it involves public expectations about OpenAI's actions. \n\n4. **Q (US conducts a nuclear test)**: This is a separate event that may depend on geopolitical factors, including tensions with other nations, military policy changes, and international treaties. Given the current global climate, I would estimate a lower probability for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: This would require both P and Q to happen, so the probability would be influenced by the individual probabilities of both events. If P is high and Q is low, this would lead to a lower probability for P_and_Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurs)**: This probability would be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the possibility of either event happening. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducts a test while OpenAI does not publish)**: This would require Q to happen while not_P is true, so its probability would depend on the likelihood of Q occurring and the low probability of not_P. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given OpenAI publishes, will the US conduct a test)**: This conditional probability would depend on the relationship between the two events. If P is true, it might influence the likelihood of Q occurring, but they may still be independent depending on the context.\n\nOverall, I expect P and Q to be somewhat independent events, but the probabilities must be carefully calibrated to ensure they satisfy the consistency rules.

I estimate P to be around 0.65, reflecting a reasonable chance that OpenAI will publish such a report due to public and regulatory pressures.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, indicating a 35% chance that OpenAI will not publish the report by the specified date.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P, and I would expect it to have the same probability since it essentially asks the same thing in different wording. Therefore, I would also estimate para_P to be 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (US conducting a nuclear test)**: The historical context and current geopolitical climate suggest a low probability for this event, given the significant international scrutiny and potential repercussions. I estimate Q to be around 0.15, indicating a relatively small chance of the US conducting a nuclear test explosion before 2030.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to occur. Given the probabilities assigned to P and Q, I would estimate P_and_Q to be the product of P and Q, resulting in approximately 0.10 (0.65 * 0.15).\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This probability would be calculated using the formula for the union of two events: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Plugging in the values, we get approximately 0.70 (0.65 + 0.15 - 0.10).\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to occur while P does not. I would estimate this probability to be Q multiplied by not_P, resulting in approximately 0.05 (0.15 * 0.35).\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability would reflect the likelihood of Q occurring given that P has occurred. Given the context, I would estimate this to be higher than Q alone, perhaps around 0.25, acknowledging that if OpenAI publishes a report, it may correlate with increased tensions or scrutiny that could lead to a nuclear test.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the probabilities assigned are consistent with the rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between these events to make sure the probabilities adhere to the mathematical rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.10 - 0.15 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.15 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.65, 0.15) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.15) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.15) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.10 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "d3664c64-918c-48ec-aee0-55b04e941328", "title": "Will OpenAI's ChatGPT not be generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024?", "body": "The question resolves as **YES** if [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) is not generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, and **NO** otherwise.\n\n\"Generally available\" here means that the default state for people in the EU is that they cannot access it without a VPN (possibly requiring paying for it.)

This is influenced by public and regulatory pressure for accountability in AI development.\n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI not publishing a report)**: This is the complement of P, and since I have a high estimate for P, I expect not_P to be lower. \n\n3. **para_P (OpenAI expected to release a report)**: This is closely related to P, and I would expect it to have a similar probability since both questions address the same event from slightly different angles.\n\n4. **Q (US conducting a nuclear test)**: The probability of the US conducting a nuclear test before 2030 is more uncertain. While geopolitical tensions could increase the likelihood, there is also significant international scrutiny and pressure against such actions. Thus, I estimate a moderate probability.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both OpenAI publishing a report and the US conducting a nuclear test is likely to be lower than either event happening independently, as they are not directly related and the nuclear test is a more uncertain event.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than both individual probabilities, as it accounts for the possibility of either event happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducting a test while OpenAI does not publish)**: This scenario is interesting because it combines the uncertainty of Q with the certainty of not_P. I would expect this probability to be low, as it combines a more uncertain event with a more definite outcome.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (US conducting a test given OpenAI publishes)**: This conditional probability depends on the relationship between the two events. If OpenAI publishes a report, it might influence geopolitical dynamics, potentially affecting the likelihood of a nuclear test.\n\nOverall, I believe the events are interrelated in that they both reflect broader themes of accountability and safety in technology and international relations, but they also have distinct factors influencing their probabilities. I will ensure that my probability estimates adhere to the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09431067947124139, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047155339735620694, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44426165831931935, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given the current trends in AI safety and transparency, I estimate a moderate to high probability that OpenAI will publish such a report, perhaps around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI not publishing a report)**: Since this is the complement of P, its probability would be 1 - P, which would be approximately 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Expected release of a report)**: This is closely related to P, as it also deals with OpenAI's actions regarding safety reports. I would estimate this similarly to P, around 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (US conducting a nuclear test)**: This event is more uncertain and could depend on various geopolitical factors. Given the current stance on nuclear testing, I would estimate a lower probability, perhaps around 0.20, since the US has generally moved away from testing.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities if we assume independence. This might be estimated as P * Q, leading to approximately 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This would be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. Given the estimates, I would expect this to be around 0.52.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducts a nuclear test and OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This would also depend on the independence of the events. If we estimate not_P as 0.35, we could calculate this as Q * not_P, leading to around 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (US conducting a nuclear test given that OpenAI publishes a report)**: This is a conditional probability and would depend on the relationship between the two events. I might estimate this to be somewhat higher than Q alone, perhaps around 0.25.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these probabilities are crucial. P and Q are not directly related, but they influence the calculations of combined events. The independence assumption is crucial for calculating joint probabilities, and adjustments may be necessary to ensure consistency across all estimates.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.52,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.52 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.52 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.52 - 0.07 is FALSE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, but, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.52,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "0c6ac27b-021e-41ac-8f5d-0d0a772a33e1", "title": "Will Iran not carry out a deadly attack within Israel before May 1, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves **Yes** if, following the date of this question's publication and before May 1, 2024, there are no credible reports indicating that an attack attributed to Iran and occurring within Israel's borders has led to the death of at least five individuals.", "resolution_date": "2024-05-01T17:53:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-10T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-26T00:07:38.815950", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('e4dc97fa-11b7-4932-b396-528b1a7f6934'), title='Will OpenAI publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c689dd4b-8086-4457-b9f5-27f6729aa7e6'), title='Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('74de38a2-db42-46d1-9646-cd392079201b'), title=\"Is OpenAI expected to release a report detailing the findings from an external assessment of their models' safety by June 30, 2024?\", body='This question will be considered **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI issues a *public* report containing the findings from an *independent* party evaluating the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('2afc0794-f14d-458e-8499-85b27de15eeb'), title='Will the US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively to verification of a nuclear explosion by the CTBTO, the UN, or if an official government statement from the US is issued confirming the test.

Given the increasing scrutiny on AI models and the importance of transparency, I would estimate a moderate to high probability that OpenAI will publish such a report by June 30, 2024. \n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI not publishing a report)**: This is simply the complement of P and should equal 1 - P. If P is high, not_P will be low. \n\n3. **para_P (Expected release of a report)**: This is closely related to P, as it also concerns the expectation of a report being released. I would expect this to be similar to P, possibly slightly higher if we consider public expectations. \n\n4. **Q (US conducting a nuclear test explosion)**: The probability of the US conducting a nuclear test before 2030 is influenced by geopolitical factors, international treaties, and the current political climate. Given the historical context and current trends, this probability might be relatively low, as nuclear tests are rare and often met with international backlash.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both events happening is likely to be lower than either event happening individually, as they are not directly dependent on each other. Thus, I would estimate this to be a product of their individual probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than either event happening alone, as it accounts for the occurrence of at least one of them.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducts a nuclear test and OpenAI does not publish)**: This is a more complex scenario involving both events. The probability of this happening would need to be evaluated based on the independence of these events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (US conducting a nuclear test given OpenAI publishes a report)**: This conditional probability would depend on the relationship between the two events. If OpenAI's actions influence the US's decisions regarding nuclear tests, this probability might be higher.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events will guide the probabilities assigned to each, and I will ensure that all estimates adhere to the consistency rules laid out.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.68,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.68 is FALSE\n\nneg, and, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09431067947124139, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047155339735620694, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44426165831931935, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This is supported by their previous commitments to responsible AI development. Therefore, I might set P around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P, so it would be 1 - P, which would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is closely related to P. I expect that if OpenAI is likely to publish a report, then the probability of them releasing a report detailing findings is similar. Therefore, I can set para_P close to P, perhaps at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Nuclear test)**: Estimating the probability of the US conducting a nuclear test is more complex. Given the political climate and international treaties, I might estimate this probability to be lower, around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This represents the probability of both events occurring. Since they are somewhat independent, I can estimate this as P multiplied by Q, leading to a value of 0.65 * 0.20 = 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This is the probability that at least one of the events occurs. Using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q, I can calculate this as 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This probability represents the scenario where the US conducts a nuclear test while OpenAI does not publish the report. Given the independence, I can estimate this as Q multiplied by not_P, leading to a value of 0.20 * 0.35 = 0.07.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability will be influenced by P. If OpenAI publishes the report, it may not directly affect the likelihood of a nuclear test. However, I might estimate it as higher than Q alone, perhaps around 0.25, reflecting some influence from the context of the report.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that all these estimates respect the consistency rules, particularly focusing on the relationships between P, not_P, Q, and their combinations.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.13,\nP_or_Q: 0.72,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.07,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.72 + 0.13 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.13 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.72 - 0.07 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.13 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09541140987375529, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047705704936877646, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4467175181476046, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

I might estimate this probability around 0.65. \n\n2. **not_P (No report from OpenAI)**: If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 1 - 0.65 = 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Expected report)**: Since this question is similar to P, I would expect para_P to have a similar probability, so I might also estimate this at 0.65. \n\n4. **Q (US nuclear test)**: Estimating the probability of a US nuclear test before 2030 is more complex. Given current geopolitical tensions, I might estimate this at around 0.20. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The occurrence of both P and Q is likely to be lower than either event alone. I might estimate this at 0.10, reflecting a joint probability that both events are somewhat independent but not mutually exclusive. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This would be higher than both P and Q individually, so I could estimate this at 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.10 = 0.75. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Nuclear test and no report)**: This would be a more specific scenario, and I might estimate this at around 0.05. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Nuclear test given report)**: Given that P occurs, the likelihood of Q might increase slightly due to the potential for increased tensions. I might estimate this at around 0.25.\n\nOverall, the estimates will be interrelated, and I will ensure that they adhere to the consistency rules provided. I will check them against each other to ensure all conditions are satisfied.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.10 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.65, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.20) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.20) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.10 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.55,\nnot_P: 0.45,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\npara_P: 0.55,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "22ab7762-cccc-4d2f-8be8-0beef0590522", "title": "Will USA not top the Olympic Medal Table at Paris 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve positively if any team achieves a higher or equal ranking to the United States Olympic Team at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Given the increasing emphasis on safety and transparency in AI development, I estimate a moderate to high probability that this will happen.\n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This is the complementary event to P. Since P has a probability estimate, not_P will be calculated as 1 - P. If P is estimated at 0.70, then not_P would be 0.30.\n\n3. **para_P (OpenAI is expected to release a report)**: This is closely related to P, and I would expect the probability to be similar, as it reflects the public expectation of the event.\n\n4. **Q (US conducts a nuclear test)**: This event is more uncertain due to geopolitical factors and global scrutiny. The probability of a nuclear test is likely to be lower given the current international climate and treaties against nuclear testing.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events happen)**: The probability of both P and Q occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities if we assume independence. However, given that the occurrence of one might influence the other (e.g., if OpenAI's report discusses nuclear safety), I will adjust this estimate accordingly.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This would be calculated using the union of the probabilities of P and Q, ensuring to account for any overlap in the events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducts a test, OpenAI does not publish)**: This event is also dependent on both individual events. I would estimate this probability based on the likelihood of Q occurring while P does not.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given OpenAI publishes, will the US test)**: This conditional probability would take into account how the publication of the report might affect the likelihood of a nuclear test. If the report discusses nuclear safety, it might decrease the likelihood of a test due to increased scrutiny.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that all estimates are consistent with the rules provided, particularly focusing on the relationships between these events and ensuring that the probabilities sum correctly according to the logical rules.\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.14,\nP_or_Q: 0.76,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.70 = 1 - 0.30 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.70 = 0.76 + 0.14 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.70 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.14 <= min(0.70, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.70, 0.20) <= 0.76 <= min(1, 0.70 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.70 = 0.76 - 0.06 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.70 \u2248 0.14 / 0.15 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.70 = 0.70 is TRUE\n\nneg, and:  cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.70,\nnot_P: 0.30,\npara_P: 0.70,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.14,\nP_or_Q: 0.76,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06,\nQ_given_P: 0.14\n\n0.7", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06618197795895964, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03309098897947982, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.36920735043032055, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
