However, COVID-19 peaks can also be influenced by new variants and changes in public health measures, leading to surges at other times of the year.\n\n- **Influenza**: The flu season in the US typically peaks between December and February but can vary, sometimes peaking as early as November or as late as March.\n\n- **RSV**: RSV generally peaks in late fall to early winter (October to December). In recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, RSV activity has shown unusual patterns, with some surges occurring earlier or later than typical due to changes in public health behaviors and immunity levels.\n\nIn the **2022-2023 season**, there was an early surge in RSV hospitalizations peaking around November, an early and intense influenza season peaking in December, and a winter COVID-19 surge peaking in January. While the peaks were relatively close, they did not all occur within a four-week window.\n\nFactors influencing the alignment of peaks in the 2023-2024 season include:\n\n- **Behavioral Changes**: With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and a return to pre-pandemic activities, respiratory viruses may follow traditional seasonal patterns, but shifts in behavior (e.g., increased travel, changes in mask-wearing) could affect transmission rates.\n\n- **Immunity Levels**: Immunity from previous infections and vaccinations can impact the timing and intensity of outbreaks. Waning immunity or changes in vaccination uptake might lead to shifts in peak timings.\n\n- **Viral Interference**: The presence of one virus can sometimes suppress or delay the spread of another due to interference, potentially causing staggered peaks.\n\n- **Climate Factors**: Seasonal weather variations can influence virus stability and transmission, potentially affecting peak periods.\n\nGiven the variability and the historical tendency for these viruses to peak at slightly different times, it's moderately unlikely that all three will reach their maximum hospitalization rates within the same four-week period.

Star Power and Fanbase: The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine brings together two of Marvel's most beloved characters. Hugh Jackman's return as Wolverine is a major draw for fans.\n\n2. Marketing and Hype: The film is likely to receive extensive marketing, generating substantial buzz and anticipation. Early trailers and promotional materials can boost audience interest.\n\n3. Growth of International Markets: Since 2016, international box office markets have expanded. Movies now often earn a larger portion of their revenue overseas, increasing global opening weekend potential.\n\n4. Success of Predecessors: Both \"Deadpool\" films were successful, indicating a strong existing audience base eager for the next installment.\n\nFactors that could prevent surpassing the record:\n\n1. R-Rating Limitations: The R-rating restricts younger audiences, potentially limiting ticket sales compared to PG-13 films.\n\n2. Competition: If other major films are released around the same time, they could split the audience and impact box office earnings.\n\n3. Economic Conditions: Global economic challenges or a downturn could reduce discretionary spending on entertainment.\n\n4. Pandemic Aftermath: Residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic might still influence movie-going habits, though theaters have been recovering.\n\n5. Projection Uncertainty: Analyst projections are not guarantees. Factors like critical reception, word-of-mouth, and unforeseen events can significantly impact actual earnings.\n\nGiven the strong projections and the considerable hype surrounding the film, it is likely to break the previous R-rated opening weekend record. However, considering the uncertainties and potential hindrances, there's still a possibility that it might not achieve this milestone."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.003596297418719141, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0017981487093595705, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08469711416439285, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The market will resolve YES if the percentage of votes for Trump when facing Biden does not exceed his percentage when facing a generic Democrat by 3% or more.\n\nTo estimate the probability of this outcome, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Manifold's User Demographics**: Manifold users are likely more educated, tech-savvy, and engaged in forecasting and current events. This demographic tends to skew younger and may lean more liberal than the general population. Therefore, they might not exhibit a significant preference difference between Biden and a generic Democrat.\n\n2. **Voter Behavior toward Biden vs. Generic Democrat**: While national polls sometimes show differences in how candidates perform against Trump, the concept of a \"generic Democrat\" often performs better due to the absence of specific criticisms or baggage associated with real candidates. However, among informed voters, this effect might be less pronounced.\n\n3. **Margin Threshold**: A 3% difference is a relatively narrow margin. Given the diversity of opinions and the sample size in Manifold polls, minor fluctuations are expected, but exceeding a 3% difference may be unlikely unless there is a strong sentiment against Biden specifically.\n\n4. **Historical Data and Patterns**: Without specific data from the polls, we can infer from general patterns that personal biases against individual candidates affect voting behavior to some extent but may not be significant enough in this context to cause a large swing.\n\n5. **Timeframe**: With only a couple of days until the polls close, significant shifts in opinion are less likely unless triggered by major events, which are not indicated.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that Trump's support among Manifold respondents will not increase by 3% or more when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat.

Values are categorized as follows: Kp \u2264 4 indicates quiet to unsettled geomagnetic conditions; Kp = 5 indicates a minor geomagnetic storm (G1 level); Kp > 5 indicates moderate to extreme geomagnetic storms (G2 to G5 levels). Historically, geomagnetic activity shows that Kp \u2264 4 is the most common, occurring the majority of the time, while Kp = 5 events are less frequent and represent minor storms. Kp > 5 events are rare and typically associated with significant solar events like coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or strong solar flares. Considering the solar cycle, we are currently in Solar Cycle 25, which began in December 2019, with the solar maximum expected around 2025, meaning solar activity will be increasing in 2024. This raises the chance of higher Kp values (>5), but such events remain relatively infrequent over short periods.

Combining \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine\" gives us the $185.5 million threshold to surpass. Comparable Marvel Films: - \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" (2022): Opened with **$187 million**. - \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" (2022): **$181 million** opening. - \"Thor: Love and Thunder\" (2022): Opened at **$144 million**. - \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" (2021): Achieved a massive **$260 million** opening.
