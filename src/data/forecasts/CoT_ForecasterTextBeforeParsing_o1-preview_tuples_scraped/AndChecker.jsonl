Condition (a): An official announcement of Joe Biden's death before market close on Friday, July 26th, 2024. Likelihood: The chance of an official announcement of President Biden's death before the specified date is tied to the probability of his passing within that timeframe. As of October 2023, Joe Biden is 80 years old. While age increases health risks, he has access to the best medical care. Statistical data from actuarial life tables suggests that an 80-year-old male has about a 5% chance of dying within a year. Since the period in question is approximately 9 months away (from October 2023 to July 2024), the probability of death in that period is slightly less than 5%, say around 3-4%. Condition (b): Biden remains US President through the end of July 2024. Likelihood: If Biden remains alive and in office without resignation or removal, he will continue as President through July 2024. The main risks to this are death, resignation, impeachment, or removal under the 25th Amendment (aside from temporary transfers of power, which don't impact the resolution). Given current political conditions, the probability of resignation or removal from office is low. Combining Conditions: However, there is an inherent contradiction between the two conditions: If there is an official announcement of his death, it would typically mean he has passed away, and he would no longer serve as President; the Vice President would assume the presidency. The only scenario where both conditions are satisfied is if there is an official announcement of his death that is later proven false, and he remains President through July 2024. Assessing the Probability of a False Official Death Announcement: Official announcements of a President's death are made with utmost care to prevent misinformation. There is no historical precedent for an official false announcement of a sitting President's death. While media outlets have erroneously reported celebrity deaths, an official government announcement in error is extremely unlikely. Conclusion: The probability of an official false announcement of President Biden's death, with him continuing as President through the end of July 2024, is extremely low but not zero. Considering all factors, the probability is minuscule."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Drafted Letter Circulated by Rep. Jared Huffman: The existence of a drafted letter indicates a formal and organized effort to consolidate opposition.

There is no precedent in modern U.S. political history for a party selecting co-nominees for the presidency. Altering this process would require significant changes to party rules and would likely face substantial legal and logistical challenges. 2. Donald Trump Jr.'s Candidacy: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Donald Trump Jr. has not declared his candidacy for the presidency. He has not participated in primary debates, nor has he campaigned for the presidential nomination. Without an active campaign, his chances of being selected as a nominee are minimal. 3. Nikki Haley's Candidacy: Nikki Haley has declared her candidacy and is participating in the Republican primaries. However, she is polling behind the leading candidates, such as former President Donald Trump Sr. and others. While it's possible for her to gain more support, overtaking the frontrunners would be a significant challenge. 4.

Event (a): The likelihood that 10 or more Democratic Senators will publicly call for Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024, is quite low. Such a public dissent would be unprecedented in recent political history and would require a major catalyst, such as a significant health issue, a major scandal, or dramatically declining poll numbers against the Republican nominee. Given the importance of party unity in a presidential election year, Democratic Senators are likely to avoid actions that could weaken their party's chances in the general election. Event (b): The probability of another Democratic Party presidential debate occurring prior to the 2024 Democratic National Convention is also low. Incumbent presidents running for re-election often do not participate in primary debates, and as of October 2023, the DNC has not scheduled any debates. While there are declared challengers like Marianne Williamson, the DNC has shown little interest in providing a platform that could highlight divisions within the party. Unless a significant challenger emerges or there is substantial pressure from within the party base, it is unlikely that the DNC will hold additional debates.

His campaign is active, and there are no official indications of withdrawal.\n- **Factors Influencing Withdrawal**:\n  - **Health Concerns**: President Biden is the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. Concerns about his age and health have been raised, but there have been no significant health issues reported that would necessitate withdrawal.\n  - **Political Pressure**: While some within the Democratic Party have discussed alternative candidates due to concerns about electability and age, there is no strong movement pressuring Biden to step down.\n  - **Historical Precedent**: It is rare for an incumbent president to withdraw from a re-election campaign.

The primary landscape is dominated by former President Donald Trump, who maintains a strong lead in national polls despite facing multiple legal challenges. His support base within the Republican Party remains solid, and he is widely considered the frontrunner for the nomination.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis was initially seen as a strong contender but has struggled to gain significant traction against Trump. Other candidates like Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, and Tim Scott are also in the race but have not made substantial gains in polling or delegate support.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, a businessman and author with no prior political experience, announced his candidacy earlier in 2023. He has gained attention for his articulate expression of conservative values and his outsider status. His performances in the Republican primary debates have increased his visibility and led to a modest rise in his polling numbers.\n\nHowever, Ramaswamy's national polling numbers remain in the single digits, typically ranging between 3% to 7%, placing him behind Trump and occasionally behind other candidates like DeSantis and Haley. He lacks the widespread name recognition and established political networks that the leading candidates possess.\n\nConsidering the following factors:\n\n1. **Incumbent Advantage**: Trump\u2019s previous tenure as president gives him a significant advantage in terms of name recognition, fundraising capabilities, and a loyal voter base.\n\n2. **Polling Data**: Current polls show Trump with a substantial lead. For Ramaswamy to secure the nomination, there would need to be a significant shift in voter sentiment.\n\n3. **Delegate Allocation**: The Republican primary system allocates delegates on a state-by-state basis, often on a winner-take-all or winner-take-most basis. This system favors candidates who can win outright in individual states, which is currently unlikely for Ramaswamy.\n\n4. **Time Constraints**: With less than a year until the Republican National Convention in August 2024, time is limited for Ramaswamy to substantially increase his support base.\n\n5. **Potential Disruptions**: Unexpected events could impact the race (e.g., legal issues for Trump or shifts in voter priorities).

Such investigations can lead to the imposition of tariffs or duties if it is determined that these subsidies are harming EU industries.\n\nThe typical duration for an EU anti-subsidy investigation is up to 13 months. However, provisional measures, such as temporary tariffs or duties, can be implemented sooner\u2014usually after approximately 9 months from the initiation of the investigation.

Presidential resignations are extremely rare in U.S. history, with only Richard Nixon having resigned under extraordinary circumstances.\n- Impeachment and Removal: While impeachment proceedings can be initiated by the House of Representatives, actual removal from office requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate.

Some legal scholars, advocacy groups, and citizens argue that Trump's actions and rhetoric leading up to and on January 6th constitute engagement in an insurrection.\n\nSeveral lawsuits and petitions have been filed or are being prepared to challenge Trump's eligibility to appear on the ballot under this provision.

Polls consistently show him leading other Republican candidates by significant margins. The likelihood of another Trump family member securing the nomination instead of Donald Trump is minimal. Therefore, the probability that a Trump family member (most likely Donald Trump himself) will be the Republican nominee is high. I estimate this probability to be around 80%. Assuming these two events are largely independent, the combined probability of both occurring is calculated by multiplying their probabilities: - Probability of Biden withdrawing: 5% (0.05) - Probability of a Trump family member being the GOP nominee: 80% (0.80) - Combined probability: 0.05 * 0.80 = 0.04 (4%) Therefore, the probability that both conditions will be met, resulting in a 'Yes' resolution to the question, is approximately 4%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) Kamala Harris becomes President or Acting President by July 26, 2024: As of October 2023, President Joe Biden is 80 years old. While there are general concerns about his age, there have been no significant public health issues reported that would suggest he cannot fulfill his duties. However, there are a few scenarios where Kamala Harris could become President or Acting President before the specified date: 1. Temporary Transfer of Power: Under the 25th Amendment, the President can temporarily transfer power to the Vice President during medical procedures requiring anesthesia. President Biden did this once on November 19, 2021, when he underwent a routine colonoscopy, making Harris the Acting President for 85 minutes. Given that he has done this once in his current term, there's a possibility he might have another such procedure before July 26, 2024. 2. Permanent Succession: In the unlikely event that President Biden resigns, is impeached and removed, or passes away, Harris would become President. Estimating the probability: - Temporary Transfer: Considering Biden's age and the possibility of routine medical procedures, let's assume there's about a 15% chance he'll temporarily transfer power again before the specified date. - Permanent Succession: Historically, the incidence of a President leaving office permanently before the end of their term is low. Given modern healthcare and security measures, let's estimate this probability at around 5%. Combining these, the total probability that Harris becomes President or Acting President is approximately 20%. (b) A Trump family member is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024: Donald Trump is currently the leading candidate in the Republican primaries. As of October 2023, polls indicate that he holds a significant lead over other contenders like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence. Despite facing legal challenges and indictments, his core support base remains strong, and these issues have not significantly dampened his polling numbers. Estimating the probability: - Donald Trump as Nominee: Given his lead in the polls and strong party support, let's estimate the probability of Donald Trump securing the nomination at 75%. - Other Trump Family Members: The likelihood of another family member (e.g., Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump) becoming the nominee is minimal. There's been no significant indication that they are seeking the nomination for 2024. We'll estimate this probability at 5%. Combining these, the total probability that a Trump family member is the nominee is approximately 80%.

He was born on November 20, 1942, which means he will be 81 years old by the end of July 2024. The question is whether he will remain President through the end of July 2024.\n\nHealth and Age Factors:\n\n- Mortality Rates: Based on actuarial tables, the annual mortality rate for an 81-year-old male in the United States is approximately 5-6%. Over a 9-month period (from the end of October 2023 to the end of July 2024), this translates to a mortality risk of around 4-5%. However, as the President, Biden has access to the best medical care available, which may slightly reduce this risk.\n\n- Medical History: There have been no publicly disclosed serious health issues that would suggest an imminent risk of death or incapacitation. While there are concerns about his age-related stamina and occasional gaffes, none point to a severe health condition.\n\nPolitical Factors:\n\n- Resignation Likelihood: There is no indication that President Biden plans to resign before the end of July 2024. He has announced his intention to run for a second term in the 2024 election, suggesting a commitment to continue his presidency.\n\n- Impeachment and Removal: While political polarization is high, the likelihood of Biden being impeached and removed from office before July 2024 is extremely low.
