The Japanese Yen has been weakening against the US Dollar over the past few years, reaching multi-decade lows. This trend is primarily due to the divergence in monetary policies between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat persistent inflation in the United States. Higher interest rates attract foreign investment into USD-denominated assets, strengthening the US Dollar. In contrast, the Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, including negative interest rates and yield curve control, to stimulate economic growth and achieve its 2% inflation target. This has led to capital outflows from Japan, weakening the Yen.\n\nLooking ahead to August 9th, 2024, several factors could influence the USD/JPY exchange rate:\n\n1. Monetary Policy Divergence: If the Federal Reserve continues to keep interest rates high or raises them further while the Bank of Japan maintains or lowers its rates, the interest rate differential will widen. This would likely strengthen the USD against the JPY.\n\n2. Economic Performance: The relative economic performance of the US and Japan will impact currency strength. If the US economy remains robust while Japan's economy struggles, the USD may appreciate further against the JPY.\n\n3. Inflation and Inflation Expectations: Persistently high inflation in the US could lead to more aggressive tightening by the Federal Reserve. Conversely, if Japan begins to see sustained inflation above its target, the Bank of Japan may adjust its policy stance, potentially strengthening the Yen.\n\n4. Currency Intervention: The Japanese government may intervene in the currency markets if the Yen weakens too rapidly, as it can negatively affect import costs and consumer prices. Such intervention could temporarily strengthen the Yen.\n\n5. Global Economic Risks: Geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, or global economic slowdowns can impact currency markets. In times of uncertainty, the Yen is often seen as a safe-haven currency, which could lead to Yen appreciation.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is potential for the Yen to strengthen due to policy shifts or interventions, the current trends and policy outlook suggest a higher likelihood of the Yen remaining weak against the Dollar.

Although there were temporary restrictions in some EU countries (like Italy in early 2023 due to privacy concerns), OpenAI addressed the issues and services were reinstated. The upcoming EU AI Act might introduce stricter regulations, but OpenAI is likely to comply to maintain access in the European market. Therefore, I estimate a high probability, around 90%, that ChatGPT will be generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024.\n\n2. **Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before June 1, 2024**:\n\n   Tensions between the Philippines and China have been escalating over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Incidents involving maritime confrontations and increased military presence suggest a worsening relationship. While diplomatic expulsions or recalls are serious actions, the likelihood has increased due to recent events and the Philippines strengthening ties with other nations like the US. I estimate a moderate probability, around 50%, that such diplomatic actions will occur before June 1, 2024.\n\n3. **OpenAI publishes a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024**:\n\n   OpenAI has demonstrated a commitment to transparency and safety.

Historical Precedent: It's exceedingly rare for sitting U.S. presidents to resign. The only instance in U.S. history was President Richard Nixon in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal. There is no comparable scandal involving President Biden as of my knowledge cutoff.\n\n2. Health Considerations: While concerns have been raised about President Biden's age (he would be 81 in 2024), there were no official reports indicating severe health issues that would necessitate his resignation or withdrawal from the election.\n\n3. Political Landscape: The Democratic Party has largely rallied behind President Biden for the upcoming election.

If President Biden intends to resign before the end of July, it's plausible he might choose a date toward the end of the month to fulfill remaining obligations.\n   - **Historical Precedent:** Looking at historical precedents, when President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, he announced his resignation on August 8 and it became effective the next day, August 9. This suggests that resignation announcements can lead to swift transitions, but the circumstances vary.\n\n2. **Factors Influencing Earlier Resignation:**\n   - **Health Concerns:** If the resignation is due to health issues, there might be a motivation for an earlier departure.\n   - **Political Pressure:** Significant political events or scandals could expedite the resignation timeline.\n   - **Succession Planning:** An earlier resignation might provide the new President with more time before the general election to establish leadership.\n\n3. **Probability Assessment:**\n   - **Even Distribution Assumption:** Without specific information on the intended resignation date, we might assume the resignation could occur at any time before the end of July.\n   - **Timeframe Analysis:** There are 31 days in July. The critical date in question is July 26, leaving 5 days between July 26 and July 31.\n   - **Calculation:** This means there is a \\( \\frac{26}{31} \\approx 83.9\\% \\) chance that the resignation could occur on or before July 26 if all dates are equally likely.\n\n4. **Adjusting for Realistic Scenarios:**\n   - **Likely Dates:** It's reasonable to assume that the resignation would be scheduled at the end of a week or on a significant date.\n   - **Late July Preference:** There may be a preference to resign at the very end of July, perhaps on July 31, decreasing the likelihood of resignation before July 26.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Balancing these factors, while there's a possibility that President Biden could resign before July 26, the lack of a specified resignation date and the tendency for such events to be scheduled toward the end of a given timeframe suggest that the probability is moderate.\n   - Considering uncertainties and without additional information, I estimate the probability to be slightly less than the even distribution calculation."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "f05fe91f-1afe-47b9-adaa-59ce3701a4a7", "title": "Given both Joe Biden drops out of re-election and resigns, and Kamala Harris becomes President, will there be diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before August 1, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Both of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden announces he is dropping out of the re-election and resigning before the end of July 2024, and (b) Kamala Harris is designated as President or Acting President before July 26, 2024.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the French Prime Minister is \u00c9lisabeth Borne from Renaissance, which is part of the Together coalition. If by July 2024, the Prime Minister is from neither NUPES nor Together, it implies a significant political shift in France. Possible scenarios include: A government formed by a different party or coalition, possibly from the right-wing National Rally (RN) or another emerging party. Political instability or a snap election resulting in a change of leadership. Such a shift indicates broader political dynamics in Europe, possibly reflecting voter dissatisfaction with incumbent parties. 2. Joe Biden is still officially President of the United States on July 31st, 2024. Joe Biden's term is scheduled to end on January 20, 2025. His continuing presidency by July 2024 is the expected scenario unless unforeseen circumstances like resignation, impeachment, or health issues occur. Given these conditions, we're to assess whether Rishi Sunak will fail to be elected as a Member of Parliament in the July 4, 2024 UK general election. Rishi Sunak's Constituency: Rishi Sunak represents Richmond (Yorks), historically a safe Conservative seat. In the 2019 general election, he secured approximately 64% of the vote. The constituency has been held by the Conservative Party for many decades. Potential Factors Influencing the Election: National Political Climate: As of 2023, the Conservative Party faces challenges, including economic issues and declining public approval. The Labour Party has been gaining in polls, suggesting possible significant losses for the Conservatives in the next election. Local Factors: Even if the Conservatives perform poorly nationally, incumbents in safe seats often retain their positions. A significant swing (over 30%) would be required for Rishi Sunak to lose his seat, which is historically unprecedented without extraordinary circumstances. Rishi Sunak's Personal Standing: As the Prime Minister, he has a high profile. Unless involved in a major scandal or controversy, his personal vote is likely strong. Impact of European Political Shifts: The change in France's leadership might signal broader political trends, perhaps a rise in nationalist or populist sentiments. However, the direct impact on a UK constituency election is likely minimal. Possible Resignation or Decision Not to Stand: If Rishi Sunak decides to resign from politics or not contest the election, he would not be re-elected. There have been instances where high-profile politicians step down, but there's no current indication this applies to Sunak. Conclusion: While the political landscape is dynamic, the probability of Rishi Sunak failing to be re-elected in his constituency is low. The required swing against him is substantial, and barring unforeseen major events directly affecting him, he is likely to retain his seat.

Poland has failed to qualify for the final several times, and San Marino, being one of the smallest participating countries, has struggled with qualifications, securing spots in the final only a few times.

Semi-final Competitiveness: The competitiveness of a Semi-final can significantly affect qualification chances.

We need to assess the probability that Ron DeSantis will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election under these conditions. 1. **Impact of Biden's Withdrawal** - **Democratic Nomination Race:** Biden's withdrawal would create an open field in the Democratic Party. Potential candidates like Vice President Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and others might enter the race. - **Republican Strategy Adjustment:** The Republican Party might reevaluate its strategy based on who the Democratic nominee becomes. If the Democrats nominate a candidate perceived as weaker or more polarizing, Republicans might feel more confident sticking with Donald Trump. Conversely, if the Democratic nominee is strong and appeals to moderate voters, Republicans might consider nominating someone with broader appeal like Ron DeSantis. 2. **Current State of the Republican Primaries (as of October 2023)** - **Donald Trump's Position:** Trump remains the frontrunner in the Republican primaries. He has a strong and loyal base despite legal issues, including indictments and ongoing court cases. His polling numbers have remained relatively stable. - **Ron DeSantis's Position:** Initially seen as a strong challenger to Trump, DeSantis's campaign has struggled to gain significant traction. Polls show DeSantis trailing Trump by a substantial margin. His campaign would need a significant boost or a major shift in the race dynamics to overtake Trump. - **Other Candidates:** Candidates like Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Mike Pence, and Vivek Ramaswamy are also in the race but are polling lower than both Trump and DeSantis. 3. **Potential Factors Influencing the Outcome** - **Legal Challenges Facing Trump:** Trump's legal issues could escalate, potentially impacting his ability to campaign or even disqualifying him in some states. If Trump were to suspend his campaign or be forced out, DeSantis could be the primary beneficiary. - **Voter Sentiment:** Republican voters might grow concerned about Trump's electability, especially if the Democratic nominee is strong. There could be a shift towards DeSantis if he is perceived as a more viable general election candidate. - **Party Leadership Influence:** GOP leaders may push for a candidate without legal entanglements to maximize their chances in the general election. 4. **Impact of France Placing in the Top 5 at the Olympics** - **Minimal Impact:** France's performance in the Olympics is unlikely to have any direct effect on the U.S. presidential race or the Republican nomination. While international events can influence global politics, this specific outcome is expected to have negligible impact on U.S. electoral dynamics. 5. **Conclusion** - **Overall Assessment:** Biden's withdrawal could slightly increase DeSantis's chances if it leads to a Democratic nominee that changes the electoral calculus. However, Trump's strong position and loyal base make him the likely nominee unless significant events alter the current trajectory. DeSantis's path to the nomination would require either a major decline in Trump's support or a consolidation of the non-Trump vote around him. **Probability:** Based on the above reasoning, I estimate that the probability of Ron DeSantis being the Republican nominee under these conditions is approximately 25%."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "1ad48876-e71a-4a32-9341-956b5073f197", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President, (b) France place in the Top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and (c) Ron DeSantis be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(a) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nThis part resolves as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement that he will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.

Despite facing multiple legal challenges and indictments, Trump maintains a strong base of support among Republican voters, with national polls showing him leading the field with approximately 50-60% support.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was initially considered a strong contender, has seen his support stagnate or decline, polling around 15-20%. Nikki Haley, the former Governor of South Carolina and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, has gained some momentum following her performances in the Republican primary debates. Her polling numbers have increased modestly, ranging from 5-10% in recent national polls.\n\nCondition (a): President Biden remains in office through July 2024. This is the expected scenario and would maintain the current political landscape. A sudden change in the presidency could significantly alter voter sentiment and campaign dynamics, but in this case, the continuity does not provide a particular advantage or disadvantage to Nikki Haley's candidacy.\n\nCondition (b): OpenAI publicly commits to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle. While this represents a positive development in corporate policy regarding artificial intelligence and could influence public discourse on technology and ethics, it is unlikely to have a direct impact on the Republican primary election or Nikki Haley's chances of securing the nomination. AI policy is not a central issue in the Republican primaries, and voters are more focused on topics like the economy, immigration, healthcare, and national security.\n\nAssessment of Nikki Haley's Chances:\n\n1. Polling Position: Nikki Haley is currently trailing significantly behind Donald Trump and is also behind or close to other candidates like Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy in some polls. Overcoming a 40-50 percentage point deficit in national and key state polls is a substantial challenge.\n\n2. Party Dynamics: Trump's influence over the Republican Party remains strong. Many Republican voters and party officials continue to support him, viewing him as the candidate most aligned with their priorities or capable of winning the general election.\n\n3. Debate Performances and Campaigning: Nikki Haley's strong debate performances have raised her profile and could lead to increased support. However, debates typically have limited impact on changing the overall dynamics of a race unless significantly altering voter perceptions.\n\n4. Potential for Shifts in the Race:\n   - Legal Issues for Trump: Ongoing legal challenges could potentially weaken Trump's candidacy. Convictions or new, damaging revelations might lead some voters to seek alternative candidates.\n   - Voter Fatigue or Preference for Change: Some Republican voters may desire a new face or a candidate without the controversies associated with Trump.\n   - Consolidation of the Anti-Trump Vote: If other candidates drop out, their supporters might consolidate behind a single alternative, potentially benefiting Nikki Haley if she positions herself effectively.\n\n5. Historical Precedents: It is relatively rare for candidates polling this far behind the frontrunner at this stage to secure the nomination without significant changes in the race dynamics.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhile it is possible for unforeseen events to dramatically alter the primary race, the probability of Nikki Haley overcoming the current deficits and securing the Republican nomination remains low.

Analysis: - Vivek Ramaswamy as Republican Nominee: Vivek Ramaswamy is known for his foreign policy views, which include a focus on American interests and skepticism about extensive military involvement overseas. His selection as the nominee might signal potential shifts in future U.S. foreign policy, but until the election occurs and policies are enacted, immediate global impacts are limited. Iran might monitor U.S. political developments but is unlikely to change its short-term military strategy based solely on a nominee selection. - Diplomatic Tensions between the Philippines and China: Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China indicate regional tensions in Southeast Asia, primarily over issues like the South China Sea disputes. While increased tensions could strain global diplomatic relations, the direct impact on Middle Eastern geopolitics, particularly Iran's stance towards Israel, is minimal. China and Iran do have strategic partnerships, but China typically advocates for stability to protect its economic interests. - Iran's Historical Behavior: Iran has historically avoided direct military action against Israel, opting to support proxy groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. A direct attack would represent a significant escalation, likely resulting in severe retaliatory actions from Israel and international condemnation. There is no clear incentive for Iran to alter this approach within the specified timeframe, even considering the given conditions. - Global Context: Unless there are additional catalysts\u2014such as direct threats to Iranian interests, significant shifts in regional alliances, or provocations from Israel\u2014the likelihood remains low.

We are to determine the probability that Joe Biden will announce before the end of July 2024 (Pacific Time) that he is both dropping out of the re-election race and resigning from the presidency, even if the formal resignation occurs later. 1. **Timing of the Announcement:** Since Joe Biden dies before July 26, 2024, any announcement he makes must occur before his death. After his death, he cannot personally announce anything. 2. **Scenarios Leading to an Announcement:** - **Anticipated Health Decline:** If President Biden becomes aware of a severe health issue that is likely terminal, he may choose to announce his intention to resign and withdraw from the re-election race. This could be motivated by a desire for a smooth transition or to focus on his health. - **Political Pressure or Scandal:** Unforeseen political events or scandals might compel him to step down. However, combining this with his death shortly after reduces the likelihood, as it would be an extraordinary coincidence. - **Sudden Death:** If his death is sudden (e.g., due to an unexpected medical event or accident), there would be no prior announcement. 3. **Historical Precedence:** Only one U.S. president has ever resigned (Richard Nixon in 1974), and it was due to the Watergate scandal. No sitting U.S. president has withdrawn from a re-election campaign after officially becoming the nominee. Presidents facing health issues have typically remained in office unless incapacitated. 4. **Age and Health Factors:** As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Joe Biden is the oldest serving U.S. president. While age increases health risks, there are protocols to handle sudden health issues without immediate resignation. Any serious health decline might lead to delegation of duties to the Vice President but not necessarily an immediate resignation announcement. 5. **Probability Estimation:** - **Low Probability Events:** The combination of Biden being aware of a terminal condition, choosing to announce his resignation and withdrawal, and then dying before July 26 is a low-probability sequence. - **Conditional Probability:** Given his death occurs before July 26, the probability that he had the opportunity and motive to announce his resignation beforehand is limited. - **External Conditions (BSE SENSEX):** The closing value of the BSE SENSEX is likely unrelated to Biden's actions. However, since condition (a) is given, we accept it as part of the scenario without impact on Biden's decision-making. **Conclusion:** Considering the above factors, while it's possible that President Biden might announce his resignation and withdrawal due to a known impending death, the likelihood is low. The most probable scenario, given his death before July 26, is that it was sudden and unexpected, without a prior announcement."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "2e070759-1a08-4fd1-8823-d74951c109a0", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) On July 21, 2024, will the closing value of BSE SENSEX be greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k?

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the BSE SENSEX is around 65,000. An increase to the specified range would require a 15-18% rise over approximately nine months. While such growth is possible in a booming economy, it is relatively optimistic given typical market fluctuations. Additionally, July 21, 2024, falls on a Sunday, and stock markets are generally closed on Sundays.

Over a three-week period (the time frame from early July to July 26, 2024), the probability is significantly lower.

Condition (a): Kamala Harris's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model, specifically if her Electoral College probability is greater than 46.6% on Friday, August 9th, at 8:40 PM. 2. Condition (b): The Prime Minister of France belongs to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024, as verified by credible sources. Analysis: First, let's interpret Condition (a). The reference to \"Kamala Harris's odds of winning\" increasing in Nate Silver's model could be understood in two ways: - Scenario 1: Kamala Harris is the Democratic Presidential nominee, and her chances of winning the presidency are increasing. - Scenario 2: Kamala Harris is the Vice Presidential nominee alongside President Joe Biden, and their ticket's chances of winning are increasing, with a focus on her impact. Given that vice presidential candidates are not typically assessed individually in election models, the phrasing suggests that Kamala Harris might be the presidential nominee. However, it's possible that the model is highlighting her role due to significant influence or events affecting her popularity. Considering Scenario 1: - If Kamala Harris is the presidential nominee, she cannot also be the vice-presidential nominee. - The probability of President Biden not running for re-election exists due to concerns about his age and health. - If Biden doesn't run, Harris is a strong potential candidate for the presidential nomination. - Thus, in this scenario, the probability of her being the vice-presidential nominee is 0%. Considering Scenario 2: - Historically, incumbent presidents running for re-election retain their vice presidents on the ticket. - If Biden is running and their odds are improving, it's unlikely he would replace Harris. - Therefore, the probability of Harris remaining the vice-presidential nominee is high. Assessing Condition (b): - The political situation in France is generally unrelated to U.S. vice-presidential nominations. - However, it may indicate global political trends or shifts that could indirectly influence U.S. politics. - Given the lack of direct impact, Condition (b) does not significantly affect the probability. Conclusion: - There is a plausible chance that President Biden may choose not to run, making Harris the presidential nominee (Scenario 1). - However, as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election with Harris as his running mate. - Given the information and assuming no significant changes, the most likely outcome is that Harris will be nominated as the vice-presidential candidate. - Accounting for the moderate possibility of Biden not running and Harris becoming the presidential nominee, I estimate the probability accordingly."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "7dfa62e0-8bab-4015-bf60-42bae00949e3", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model (b) The Prime Minister of France belongs to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024 (c) Kamala Harris is nominated as the Democratic VP?", "body": "(a) Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Kamala Harris is the Vice President under President Joe Biden. The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election is approaching, and it's customary for the incumbent Vice President to be part of the re-election campaign if the President seeks a second term. Assuming Kamala Harris is on the ticket, her odds in election models like Nate Silver's would be closely tied to the overall performance of the Democratic campaign. Predicting whether her Electoral College probability will exceed 46.6% on Friday, August 9th at 8:40 PM in 2024 requires forecasting the state of the race at that specific time. Election probabilities can fluctuate due to various factors such as campaign events, debates, and news cycles. Given the uncertainties, there's roughly an even chance that her odds could increase beyond that threshold. Therefore, I estimate the probability of this event at 50%. (b) The Prime Minister of France belongs to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024. As of October 2023, the French political landscape is dominated by major coalitions, including Ensemble (Together) led by President Emmanuel Macron's party and the New Popular Union (NUPES), a left-wing alliance. The Prime Minister is typically appointed from the ruling coalition. Unless there are scheduled elections or significant political shifts anticipated before July 2024, it's unlikely that a new coalition outside of these major groups would take power. Political coalitions in France can be stable over several years, and sudden changes are relatively rare without triggering events. Thus, I estimate the probability of this event at 20%. (c) Kamala Harris is nominated as the Democratic VP. Given that Kamala Harris is the incumbent Vice President, it's highly probable she would be nominated again if President Biden runs for re-election. Even if President Biden decides not to run, Kamala Harris may seek the presidential nomination herself or be selected as the vice-presidential candidate by another Democratic nominee. Considering these scenarios, the likelihood of her being the Democratic VP nominee is high. Therefore, I estimate the probability of this event at 80%. Combined Probability: Assuming these three events are independent, the combined probability is calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities: P(a and b and c) = P(a) \u00d7 P(b) \u00d7 P(c) = 0.50 \u00d7 0.20 \u00d7 0.80 = 0.08"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2786637604373941, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Reports of any number of unnamed democrats writing to Biden and asking him to step aside will not satisfy this criterion unless at least 5 qualifying names are later made public before this date. If these criteria are not met before July 20th, this condition is not satisfied.\n\n(b) Joe Biden must still be officially president of the United States at 11:59 pm on July 31st 2024.\n\n(c) There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6.

Are Manifold respondents representative of the general public?\n\nThis market will resolve YES if the percentage of votes for Donald Trump in poll 1 exceeds that in poll 2 by 3% or more when both polls close.\n\nThe formula for determining the percentage of votes for Trump is (Trump / (Trump + (the Democrat in the question) + Someone else)). The answer is YES if this formula for poll 1 - the formula for poll 2 >= 0.03. Otherwise, it is NO.\n\nThe polls and this question will never resolve N/A, and will remain open until the close time no matter what.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-01T14:50:29Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-04T11:04:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.0245, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To determine the probability that all three conditions (a), (b), and (c) will occur, I'll assess each individually and then combine the probabilities.\n\nCondition (a): A group of at least 5 named Democratic House Members or US Senators pressure Biden to drop out before July 20th, 2024.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, President Joe Biden has declared his intention to run for re-election in 2024. While there are discussions about his age and concerns among some voters and party members, there has been no significant public movement among Democratic lawmakers to urge him to drop out. Historically, it's rare for members of a sitting president's own party to openly and collectively pressure them not to seek re-election, unless there are substantial reasons such as major scandals or significant declines in approval ratings.\n\nFor this condition to be met, a substantial shift would need to occur within the Democratic Party. This could be triggered by unforeseen events that severely impact Biden's standing or capability to run. Given the lack of indications toward such a development up to my knowledge cutoff, I estimate the probability of this condition being satisfied to be low, around 5%.\n\nCondition (b): Joe Biden still being president by the end of July 2024.\n\nPresident Biden's term runs until January 20th, 2025. Unless he resigns, is removed from office, or passes away, he will remain president through July 2024. While considerations about his age are relevant, there are no current indications of health issues that might lead to his departure from office before this date. Historical data shows that it's uncommon for presidents not to serve out their term. Therefore, I estimate a high probability, around 98%, that Biden will still be president at the end of July 2024.\n\nCondition (c): Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat.\n\nThis condition involves the results of two Manifold polls closing on July 6th, 2024. It requires that the percentage of votes for Donald Trump is at least 3% higher when facing Joe Biden compared to a generic Democrat among Manifold users.\n\nManifold Markets users may not represent the general electorate but might have tendencies that can be analyzed. Given that some voters might prefer a generic Democrat over Biden due to concerns about his age or performance, it's plausible that Trump would perform better against Biden than a generic Democrat in these polls.

First, it's important to note that there is no credible causal link between the IMDB rating of a television show and geopolitical events involving Iran and Israel. Therefore, the condition regarding the IMDB rating does not meaningfully influence the probability of the specified attack occurring. We can treat the events as independent for the purposes of this estimation. Next, considering the geopolitical context as of October 2023: - Historical Context: Iran and Israel have long-standing tensions. Iran has been known to support proxy groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, which have engaged in hostilities against Israel. - Recent Developments: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there have been intermittent escalations, but no direct attacks attributed to Iran within Israel's borders resulting in multiple fatalities in a short time frame. - Security Measures: Israel maintains robust intelligence and security operations to prevent attacks within its borders. The effectiveness of these measures reduces the likelihood of successful large-scale attacks orchestrated by external state actors like Iran. - Time Frame: The period between April 10, 2024, and May 1, 2024, is approximately three weeks.

Over the next 9 months, this translates to roughly a 6% chance. However, President Biden has access to top-tier medical care, which may reduce this risk slightly. 2. **Temporary Transfer of Power Due to Medical Procedures**: Presidents have temporarily transferred power to their vice presidents during medical procedures requiring anesthesia (e.g., colonoscopies). Biden underwent a routine colonoscopy in November 2021, during which he temporarily transferred power to Harris for about 85 minutes\u2014the first time a woman held presidential power in the U.S. Given his age, it's plausible he may have another procedure before July 2024. 3. **Resignation or Removal from Office**: Barring unforeseen scandals or significant health issues, the likelihood of Biden resigning or being removed from office via impeachment is minimal. 4. **Invoking the 25th Amendment**: Sections 3 and 4 allow for the vice president to become acting president if the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office. This is unlikely unless there is a severe health crisis.

The last significant instance was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, who announced he would not seek re-election far earlier in the year. Dropping out in mid-July would be unprecedented without extraordinary circumstances.\n\n2. **Poll Margins:** A deficit of 2 to 3 points in national polls is relatively small and within the margin of error. Polls can fluctuate significantly, and campaigns are aware that national polling does not capture the complexities of the Electoral College system. Such a margin is not typically a cause for a candidate to withdraw.\n\n3. **Campaign Strategy:** The Biden campaign would likely view a small polling deficit as a challenge to overcome rather than a reason to exit the race. There would still be time to adjust strategies, focus on key swing states, and energize the voter base.\n\n4. **Health Considerations:** While Joe Biden's age raises questions about health risks, there has been no indication as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021 that he has health issues severe enough to force him out of the race.

This could weaken the party's prospects in the general election. The party would likely encourage Biden to remain in the race unless absolutely necessary.\n\n6. **Unforeseen Events:** The possibility of unforeseen events (e.g., legal issues, scandals, major personal matters) forcing a dropout cannot be entirely ruled out but are inherently unpredictable and statistically rare.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of Biden dropping out before July 20, 2024, under the specified polling conditions, is extremely low."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "42aa6d40-4aa6-4ab1-80cf-65180e89d699", "title": "Given Trump's lead over Biden is between 2 and 3 points on July 15, 2024, and Biden drops out before July 20, 2024, will Iran carry out a deadly attack within Israel before May 1, 2024?", "body": "Suppose both of the following conditions are true: (a) On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points according to 538's national polling average, and (b) Joe Biden drops out of the 2024 presidential race before July 20, 2024.

The attack by Iran (Q) is supposed to occur before May 1, 2024, while the conditions (P) we're given information about occur in mid-July 2024.

Definition of Individual Neutral Athletes: Individual Neutral Athletes (INA) refer to athletes who compete under a neutral flag due to the suspension or sanctions of their National Olympic Committee (NOC). In recent Olympics, this status has mainly applied to Russian athletes facing sanctions due to doping scandals and, more recently, geopolitical issues.\n\n2. Historical Performance: At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Russian athletes competed under the banner of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) and won 20 gold medals. This performance was achieved despite not competing under their national flag but still representing a coordinated team effort.\n\n3. Current Geopolitical Context: As of October 2023, the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in the Paris 2024 Olympics remains uncertain due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has yet to make a definitive decision regarding their participation. If allowed, it's possible they will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes with potential restrictions.\n\n4. Potential Restrictions: Should Russian and Belarusian athletes compete as INAs, they may face stricter limitations than in Tokyo 2020. Possible restrictions include reduced team sizes, bans in certain sports, or additional qualification hurdles. This would likely decrease the total number of gold medals they could win compared to previous Games.\n\n5. Likelihood of Winning 21+ Gold Medals: Given that the ROC won 20 gold medals at Tokyo 2020 under less restrictive conditions, it's improbable that INAs will surpass this number in Paris 2024 under potentially stricter sanctions. Achieving 21 or more gold medals would require exceptional performances without the full support and coordination typically afforded to national teams.\n\n6. Condition of Women's Team Sports: The initial condition is that the same nation wins gold in more than one of the eight women's team sports listed. Historically, countries like the USA have strong women's teams across multiple sports (e.g., basketball, soccer, volleyball). However, this condition does not significantly impact the performance of INAs, as their medal tally is more dependent on their own athletes' participation and success.\n\n7. Independence of Events: The success of a nation in women's team sports is largely independent of the number of gold medals won by INAs. Therefore, the probability of INAs winning at least 21 gold medals remains low regardless of the outcome in women's team sports.\n\n8. Conclusion: Considering the uncertainties surrounding the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes, potential increased restrictions, and historical data from Tokyo 2020, it's unlikely that Individual Neutral Athletes will win 21 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "9a2b18d2-c769-4879-bb72-7745ac9d5882", "title": "Given that both a single nation wins more than one women's team sport and Individual Neutral Athletes win 21 or more gold medals at Paris 2024, will the USA top the Olympic Medal Table?", "body": "This question considers the scenario where both of the following occur at the Paris 2024 Olympics:\n(a) The same National Olympic Committee (NOC) wins gold in more than one of the eight women's team sports: association football, 3\u00d73 basketball, 5\u00d75 basketball, field hockey, handball, rugby sevens, volleyball, and water polo.\n(b) Individual Neutral Athletes collectively win 21 or more gold medals, as determined by the official medal tally published by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or other credible sources if IOC reporting is unavailable.\n\nGiven these conditions, will the United States Olympic Team be the unique highest ranked team at the 2024 Paris Olympics?

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Kamala Harris is the incumbent Vice President of the United States alongside President Joe Biden. It is customary for a sitting Vice President to be renominated if the President seeks re-election, barring any significant political shifts or controversies. There have been no substantial indications or announcements suggesting that Harris will be replaced on the Democratic ticket for the 2024 election. Therefore, the likelihood of Kamala Harris being nominated again as the Democratic Vice President is high. Estimated Probability for Condition 1: 90%. Condition 2: At least five named Democratic Party US House Members or US Senators work together to ask Joe Biden to consider ending his 2024 re-election campaign before July 20th, 2024. This scenario would represent a major intra-party challenge to a sitting President, which is rare and politically risky. While there have been concerns raised privately and publicly about President Biden's age and approval ratings, a collective action by at least five Democratic lawmakers urging him to step down would be unprecedented in modern times without a significant catalyst, such as a major scandal or health crisis. Given the potential negative impact on party unity and election prospects, Democratic lawmakers are likely to avoid such a public move unless there are extraordinary circumstances. Therefore, the probability of this condition being met is low. Estimated Probability for Condition 2: 10%. Condition 3: Joe Biden appears in an in-person interview for at least 45 minutes, released before the end of July 2024. During election campaigns, presidential candidates often engage with the media to communicate their platforms and counter opponents. While traditional media interviews may be shorter, long-form interviews are becoming more common, especially on platforms like podcasts, YouTube channels, and special television segments. President Biden may choose to participate in an extended interview to reach voters more directly. However, scheduling and strategic considerations might limit the occurrence of such lengthy interviews. Balancing these factors, there is a moderate chance that this condition will be satisfied. Estimated Probability for Condition 3: 50%. Combined Probability: To determine the probability that all three conditions are met, we multiply the probabilities of each individual condition, assuming they are independent events: Total Probability = P1 * P2 * P3 = 0.9 * 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.045.

If President Biden were to drop out, it's reasonable to assume that major media outlets would report on it prior to an official announcement, given the high level of public interest and the nature of political news cycles. Media leaks and unofficial confirmations are common in such scenarios. Let's estimate the probability of early media coverage at around 70%. Assuming these events are independent (since there's no direct causal link between Machado's imprisonment and Biden's potential dropout), we can calculate the conditional probability: Probability that Biden drops out and the media covers it early: 10% (Biden drops out) * 70% (media covers early) = 7%.

Historical Context: - France has experienced several terrorist attacks in recent years, notably between 2015 and 2017, including the Charlie Hebdo shooting, the Bataclan theatre attack, and the Nice truck attack. - Since then, the frequency of major terrorist incidents in France has decreased due to enhanced security measures and intelligence efforts. 2. High-Profile Events as Targets: - International events like the Summer Olympics can be attractive targets for terrorist groups seeking maximum visibility. - The 1972 Munich Olympics is a historical example where a terrorist attack occurred during the Games. - However, in recent decades, the Olympics have been held without major terrorist incidents, partly due to increased global security collaboration. 3. Security Measures for the 2024 Paris Olympics: - The French government is likely to implement extensive security protocols, including: - Deployment of thousands of security personnel. - Enhanced surveillance and intelligence operations. - Coordination with international security agencies to monitor and mitigate threats. - Technological advancements in security (e.g., facial recognition, drone monitoring) will likely be utilized to prevent potential attacks. 4. Current Threat Level: - As of October 2023, France's national threat level remains elevated but stable. - There are no publicly known specific threats targeting the 2024 Olympics. - Global terrorist activities have been decentralized, with many groups weakened due to international counterterrorism efforts. 5. Preventive Actions and Intelligence: - French intelligence agencies have a track record of thwarting plots before they materialize. - Increased public vigilance campaigns and community policing may contribute to early detection of suspicious activities. 6.

This could stem from concerns about his age, health, or political performance. However, primary debates are a normal part of the electoral process and do not directly imply that the President is unable to discharge the duties of his office. Internal party challenges are common and do not necessarily lead to the invocation of the 25th Amendment.\n\nSecondly, the Greens\u2013EFA winning the most seats in the European Parliament would represent a major shift in European politics toward environmental and progressive policies. While this is significant on a global scale, the direct impact on U.S. domestic politics is minimal.

Historically, when an incumbent president runs for re-election, the party typically unites behind them, and primary debates are rare or nonexistent. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has not scheduled any debates and has shown little interest in organizing one.

Impact of the Special Election: The outcome of the special election in Ohio's 6th district is unlikely to have a direct impact on the invocation of the 25th Amendment.

Witness tampering is a serious offense. Given the ongoing legal proceedings and the high-profile nature of the case, there is a possibility that additional charges could be brought if evidence of witness tampering emerges.

Men's Marathon: Eliud Kipchoge, a Kalenjin athlete, is the world record holder and the reigning Olympic champion, having won gold in the men's marathon at both the 2016 Rio Olympics and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. He will be 39 years old during the Paris Olympics, which could impact his performance due to age-related factors. However, his consistency and experience make him a strong contender. Other Kalenjin athletes, such as Geoffrey Kamworor and Lawrence Cherono, are also among the world's top marathon runners and could secure the gold if Kipchoge does not. Women's Marathon: Peres Jepchirchir and Brigid Kosgei, both Kalenjin athletes, are leading figures in women's marathon running. Peres Jepchirchir won the gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Brigid Kosgei holds the women's marathon world record and has consistently performed at the highest level. Competition is strong from Ethiopian runners like Letesenbet Gidey and athletes from other countries, which adds uncertainty. Conditional Factors: The condition of at least five countries winning their first-ever gold medals suggests a broader distribution of top athletic talent or perhaps a shift in competitive dynamics. However, this condition doesn't directly impact the marathon events. There is no significant evidence to suggest that the success of new countries in other events would adversely affect the performance of Kalenjin marathon runners. Probability Assessment: Estimating a 70% probability that a Kalenjin athlete will win the men's marathon. Estimating a 50% probability for the women's marathon. Assuming the events are independent, the combined probability is 0.7 x 0.5 = 0.35 or 35%. Considering potential correlations (like shared training conditions or national factors), the probability might be slightly higher, but competition from other top runners tempers this. Conclusion: Given the dominance of Kalenjin athletes in marathon running and their recent Olympic successes, there is a significant chance they will win both the men's and women's marathon at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

These events have led to increased vigilance and the enhancement of security and counter-terrorism measures. Hosting the Olympics is a significant undertaking, and the French government is expected to implement robust security protocols to protect athletes, spectators, and venues. This includes intelligence gathering, increased police and military presence, and international cooperation.\n\n**Impact of the Specified Conditions:** The conditional events\u2014five countries winning their first-ever gold medals and both marathons being won by athletes with Kalenjin roots\u2014are primarily sporting outcomes. The Kalenjin people, predominantly from Kenya, are renowned for their long-distance running success. Both marathon wins by Kalenjin athletes would not be unexpected given historical performance. Additionally, new countries winning gold medals is a positive aspect of the Games, promoting diversity and global representation.\n\nThere is no direct causal link between these sporting results and an increased likelihood of a terrorist attack. These outcomes are unlikely to provoke or motivate terrorist activities. Terrorist groups typically have political, ideological, or religious motivations, and unless the sporting outcomes impinge upon these areas (which seems unlikely), they should not influence the probability of an attack.\n\n**General Risk Assessment:** The Olympics are a high-profile event that can be a target for terrorist organizations seeking attention. However, the overall risk is mitigated by extensive security preparations. While the risk cannot be reduced to zero, it remains relatively low.\n\nConsidering all these factors, and given that the specified conditions do not significantly alter the security landscape or threat level, the probability of a terrorist attack occurring in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics remains close to the baseline probability without the conditions."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "8d8453ef-611e-4898-a110-1a67e0744ca3", "title": "Will both of the following occur during the 2024 Summer Olympics: (1) At least 5 countries win their debut gold medal and Kalenjin athletes win both the men's and women's marathon races, and (2) A terrorist act occurs in metropolitan France?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (1) At the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, at least 5 countries win their first-ever Olympic gold medal, and both the men's and women's marathon winners have Kalenjin roots according to credible sources.
