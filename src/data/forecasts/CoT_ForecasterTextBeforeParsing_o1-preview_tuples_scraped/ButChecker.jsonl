The key factors affecting whether he remains in office through the end of July 2024 and does not pass away before July 26, 2024, are: 1. Health and Mortality Risk: - Age: As of now, Joe Biden is 80 years old (born November 20, 1942). By July 2024, he will be 81. According to actuarial life tables, the annual mortality rate for an 81-year-old male is approximately 8-9%. - Health Status: Biden undergoes regular medical examinations and has been reported to be in good health for his age. Access to top-tier healthcare likely reduces his mortality risk compared to the general population. - Time Frame: The period in question is around 9 months. Adjusting the annual mortality risk proportionally gives an estimated mortality risk of about 6% during this period. 2. Political Factors: - Resignation: There is little indication that Biden intends to resign. Presidents typically serve their full terms unless extraordinary circumstances arise. - Impeachment or Removal: While political tensions exist, the likelihood of impeachment leading to removal from office is historically low. No U.S. president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. - 25th Amendment: Invoking the 25th Amendment to declare the president unfit is unprecedented and would require consensus among high-ranking officials, which is unlikely without clear and compelling reasons. 3. Temporary Transfer of Power: - A temporary transfer of power to the Vice President under the 25th Amendment does not affect the resolution, as specified in the question. Conclusion: Considering the above factors, the most significant risk is age-related health issues, but even that risk is relatively low over the specified time frame.

His dominant position in the polls suggests he is the frontrunner for the nomination.\n\n- Party Dynamics: The Republican National Convention delegates are likely to select a candidate who has demonstrated significant support during the primaries and caucuses. Unless there is a major shift in the political landscape, Donald Trump's position as the leading candidate positions him favorably to secure the nomination.\n\n- Potential Uncertainties: Factors that could affect this outcome include the progression of legal cases against him, potential convictions before the convention, health issues, or a significant change in voter sentiment. However, as of now, there is no strong indication that these factors will prevent him from becoming the nominee.\n\nConclusion: Given the low probability of (a) occurring and the high probability of (b) occurring, the overall likelihood that the question resolves as \"Yes\" is driven primarily by the chances of Donald Trump becoming the Republican nominee."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.06517736079527844, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The question is whether Kamala Harris will be formally designated as President or Acting President before July 26, 2024.\n\nSeveral scenarios could lead to this outcome:\n\n1. **Temporary Transfer of Power**: Under the 25th Amendment, Section 3, a president can voluntarily transfer power to the vice president if they are undergoing a procedure that requires anesthesia or are otherwise unable to perform their duties temporarily. This has occurred a few times in recent history, such as when President George W. Bush underwent a colonoscopy.\n\n2. **Presidential Incapacitation**: If the president becomes incapacitated due to health reasons, the vice president may assume the role of acting president. Given President Biden's age (he would be 81 years old in 2024), there is an increased risk of health issues that could lead to temporary or permanent incapacitation.\n\n3. **Resignation or Death**: Although unlikely, the president could resign or pass away while in office, resulting in the vice president becoming president.\n\n4. **Invocation of the 25th Amendment, Section 4**: This allows the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the president unfit for office. This is a drastic and unprecedented measure and is considered highly unlikely.\n\nAssessing the probabilities:\n\n- **Temporary Medical Procedure**: Presidents occasionally undergo medical procedures requiring anesthesia. However, without specific information about upcoming procedures for President Biden, the probability is low. Let's estimate around a 2% chance.\n\n- **Health-Related Incapacitation or Death**: Given President Biden's age, the statistical risk of significant health events increases. However, modern medical care and the lack of known serious health issues reduce this risk. Estimating a 1% chance.\n\n- **Resignation**: There is no indication that President Biden intends to resign before the end of his term. Probability is very low, perhaps 0.5%.\n\n- **25th Amendment, Section 4 Invocation**: This is highly unlikely without clear and compelling reasons. Estimating a 0.1% chance.\n\nCombining these probabilities (while being careful not to double-count overlapping scenarios), the total estimated probability is approximately:\n\n\\[ 2\\% + 1\\% + 0.5\\% + 0.1\\% = 3.6\\% \\]\n\nRounded to a reasonable estimate, I would say there's about a **4%** chance that Kamala Harris will be formally designated as President or Acting President before July 26, 2024."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "ba39ade4-8bcd-4b46-976c-b3daf0354941", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Biden drops out before July 20, 2024, and (b) Kamala Harris is not designated President by July 26, 2024?", "body": "(a) Biden drops out or is otherwise unable to continue the race before July 20, 2024, midnight Eastern Time.

These legal issues have not substantially diminished his polling numbers or his appeal to a sizable portion of the electorate.\n\nSeveral factors could potentially prevent Donald Trump from securing the nomination:\n\n1. **Legal Challenges:** Convictions or legal barriers arising from ongoing cases could impede his ability to campaign effectively or render him ineligible, depending on the outcomes.\n\n2. **Health Concerns:** At 77 years old, unforeseen health issues could impact his candidacy.\n\n3. **Shift in Voter Sentiment:** Significant political developments or revelations could sway public opinion and elevate another candidate.\n\nHowever, none of these factors currently present a definitive obstacle to his nomination. His dominance in polls suggests that, barring unexpected events, he is likely to be selected by the Republican National Convention delegates.\n\nRegarding **Donald Trump Jr.**, there is no indication that he is seeking the Republican nomination. He has not declared his candidacy, participated in debates, or engaged in campaign activities that suggest an intention to run for president. There is also no substantial support or movement within the party advocating for his nomination. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that he will be selected as the nominee.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **The probability that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee is high (approximately 80%).**\n- **The probability that Donald Trump Jr. will not be the nominee is even higher (approaching 99.9%).**\n\nSince the question requires both conditions to be met for a \"Yes\" resolution, the overall probability is effectively determined by the likelihood of Donald Trump being the nominee, as Donald Trump Jr.'s candidacy is negligible."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "454b5072-ea65-443d-b7a7-012fb7a3a9a4", "title": "Will either Donald Trump Jr. or Donald Trump be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either Donald Trump Jr. or Donald Trump is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, his support has fluctuated, and he hasn't consistently closed the gap with Trump.\n\n- **Vivek Ramaswamy**: A businessman and political newcomer, Ramaswamy has gained attention for his outsider status and articulate messaging. While he has seen some increases in support, he generally polls behind Trump and DeSantis, often in the single digits.\n\n- **Chris Christie**: The former Governor of New Jersey has positioned himself as a vocal critic of Donald Trump within the Republican Party. Christie focuses on restoring traditional Republican values and has campaigned heavily in early primary states like New Hampshire. Despite his efforts, he polls in the low single digits nationally, often around 2-3%.\n\n**Factors Affecting Chris Christie's Nomination Chances:**\n\n1. **Polling Numbers**: Historically, candidates polling in the low single digits at this stage have a minimal chance of securing the nomination. Christie's low national and state-level polling suggests limited support among Republican voters.\n\n2. **Party Dynamics**: The Republican Party has a strong pro-Trump faction. Christie's open criticism of Trump may alienate a significant portion of the Republican base, making it harder to gain widespread support.\n\n3. **Campaign Resources**: Campaign funding and grassroots support are crucial. Christie lacks the financial resources and broad donor base that top-tier candidates like Trump and DeSantis have.\n\n4. **Debate Performances**: While debates offer opportunities to shift momentum, Christie would need standout performances to significantly alter his standing. So far, there is no indication of a dramatic shift resulting from debates.\n\n5. **Historical Precedent**: It's rare for candidates trailing significantly in polls at this stage to win the nomination without a major shift in the race dynamics.\n\n**Vivek Ramaswamy Not Being the Nominee:**\n\n- Given that only one candidate can be the nominee, if Chris Christie were to secure the nomination, it would automatically mean Vivek Ramaswamy is not the nominee.\n- Ramaswamy's outsider status and lack of political experience make his path to the nomination challenging, although his polling is somewhat higher than Christie's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the factors above, the probability of Chris Christie becoming the Republican nominee is quite low.

Unless there is a major unforeseen event, such as a severe decline in health or a significant scandal, it is unlikely that 10 or more Democratic Senators will publicly call for Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024.\n\nRegarding the possibility of another Democratic Party presidential debate, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has shown no indications of scheduling such debates for the 2024 primary season. With President Biden as the incumbent and presumptive nominee, and with no major Democratic challengers like Vice President Harris, Governor Newsom, or Governor Whitmer announcing a run against him, the likelihood of organizing a debate is low. The DNC typically avoids debates when there is an incumbent president seeking re-election to project party unity.\n\nHowever, the realm of politics is unpredictable. There is a small chance that unexpected events could lead to significant shifts. For instance, if President Biden were to face health issues or a significant drop in approval ratings, influential party members might urge him to reconsider his candidacy. Similarly, a major Democratic figure could decide to challenge him, prompting debates.\n\nConsidering these factors, while both scenarios are unlikely, the combined probability that either event (a) or (b) occurs is slightly higher than if we considered them independently."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.003534160276822018, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0011780534256073394, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.094979203590053, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The question asks for the probability of Joe Biden dying before Saturday, July 26th, 2024, which is a period of 23 days from the created date of July 3rd, 2024. \n\nTo estimate this probability, we can use actuarial life tables that provide mortality rates for individuals based on age and gender. According to the Social Security Administration's actuarial life table, the annual probability of death for an 81-year-old male is approximately 6.5%. \n\nTo find the probability of death over a 23-day period, we can assume that the mortality risk is evenly distributed over the year. Since there are 365 days in a year, 23 days represent approximately 6.3% of a year (23/365 \u2248 0.063). \n\nUsing the exponential mortality model, the probability P of death over t years is: \n\nP = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t} \n\nwhere \\lambda is the mortality rate. First, we calculate \\lambda: \n\n\\lambda = -\\ln(1 - q) \n\n\\lambda = -\\ln(1 - 0.065) \\approx 0.0672 \n\nThen, we calculate P: \n\nP = 1 - e^{-0.0672 \\times 0.063} \n\nP = 1 - e^{-0.0042336} \n\nP \\approx 1 - 0.99577 \n\nP \\approx 0.00423 \\text{ or } 0.423\\% \n\nConsidering that President Biden has access to excellent healthcare and regular medical check-ups, his mortality risk may be slightly lower than the average for his age group. However, factors like the stresses associated with the presidency could counterbalance this advantage. Additionally, while the risk of sudden events such as accidents or security threats exists, these are statistically minimal and do not significantly affect the overall probability. \n\nTherefore, based on available data and reasonable assumptions, the probability that Joe Biden will die before July 26th, 2024, is approximately 0.4%."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "93117ccf-1145-408a-9511-f07c4ac45cce", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee will be a Woman (b) Joe Biden will not die before Saturday?", "body": "This question resolves to \u201cyes\u201d if both of the following conditions are met: \n\n(a) The Democratic delegates select a female presidential nominee for the 2024 election.\n(b) There is no official announcement of Joe Biden's death before market close at the end of Friday, July 26th.\n\nIt resolves to \u201cno\u201d if either or both of these conditions are not met.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-06T13:22:40Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-03T21:21:49Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.05, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, President Joe Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024 and is the incumbent Democratic candidate.

Such a move could risk party unity and electoral prospects. Unless there are unforeseen circumstances\u2014such as a drastic decline in health, major scandals, or significant drops in approval ratings\u2014it is unlikely that a group of at least five Democratic senators or representatives would collectively urge Biden to end his campaign before July 20, 2024. I estimate the probability of this event occurring to be around 5%.\n\n**Combined Probability**\n\nAssuming that the two events are independent, the probability that at least one of them occurs is calculated as:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) \u2013 P(A) \u00d7 P(B)\n\nWhere:\n- P(A) = Probability of Event 1 occurring = 65% = 0.65\n- P(B) = Probability of Event 2 occurring = 5% = 0.05\n\nCalculating:\nP(A or B) = 0.65 + 0.05 \u2013 (0.65 \u00d7 0.05)\nP(A or B) = 0.70 \u2013 0.0325\nP(A or B) = 0.6675\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the events occurs before their respective deadlines is approximately 66.75%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.059696914167584936, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

While concerns have been raised about Biden's age and health, there have been no definitive indications that he plans to step down before the nomination.\n\n**First Condition:**\nThe probability of Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination is relatively low. Factors that could influence such a decision include health complications or significant shifts in political support within his party. Assuming no unforeseen major events, I estimate this probability to be around 10%.\n\n**Second Condition:**\nRegarding the polling data, national polls can fluctuate due to various factors like economic conditions, international events, and campaign dynamics. The specific condition is that Trump's lead over Biden is less than or equal to 2 points or greater than 3 points on July 15, 2024, according to FiveThirtyEight's national polling average. Given the polarization in U.S. politics and historical polling trends, it's plausible that the polling difference will not fall within the narrow window of (2, 3] points.

There have been no significant indications or announcements suggesting that he plans to withdraw or decline the Democratic Party's nomination before July 15, 2024. The likelihood of him making such an announcement is relatively low unless unexpected circumstances arise, such as health issues or significant political developments. I would estimate the probability of this event occurring to be around 5%. \n\nRegarding the polling data, national polls between Donald Trump and Joe Biden have shown varying leads for both candidates over time. Polling averages can fluctuate due to numerous factors, including current events, economic conditions, and campaign developments. The specific scenario where Donald Trump leads Joe Biden by greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 percentage points on July 15, 2024, according to FiveThirtyEight's national polling average, is a narrow range. Given the variability in polling, there's a moderate chance that the lead could fall within this specific window on that exact date. I would estimate the probability of this happening to be around 15%. \n\nSince the question will resolve as \"Yes\" if either event occurs, we can combine the probabilities.
