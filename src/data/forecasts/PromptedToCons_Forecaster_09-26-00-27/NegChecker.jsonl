However, his busy schedule and the fact that he might not prioritize this event could lower the probability.\n\n### not_P: Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n\n**Reasoning:** This is the complement of P. If P happens, not_P does not, and vice versa. This must be consistent with the negation rule.\n\n### para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n\n**Reasoning:** This is essentially the same as P, given the context. Hence, para_P should be equal to P.\n\n### Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n\n**Reasoning:** Colonization of Mars is a long-term goal with significant technological and logistical challenges. The Moon is closer and might be easier to colonize first, but Mars has more long-term potential. Given the timelines involved, this is a low-probability event.\n\n### P_and_Q: Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (2) Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 residents before the Moon?\n\n**Reasoning:** This is the intersection of P and Q. Both events happening together is less likely than either happening individually.\n\n### P_or_Q: Will either of the following occur: (a) Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024? (b) Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n\n**Reasoning:** This is the union of P and Q. The probability of either event happening is higher than the probability of both happening together.\n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will both of the following occur: (1) Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does and (2) Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n\n**Reasoning:** This is the intersection of Q and not_P. It considers the scenario where Q happens but P does not.\n\n### Q_given_P: Given that Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n\n**Reasoning:** This is the conditional probability of Q given P. If P happens, the probability of Q might be influenced by Musk's involvement in space exploration, but it remains relatively low.\n\n### Independence and Relationships\n\n- **P and Q:** These events are largely independent. Musk's appearance at a Bitcoin conference does not directly influence Mars colonization timelines.\n- **Consistency Rules:**\n  - **neg:** P = 1 - not_P\n  - **andor:** P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q\n  - **and:** max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)\n  - **or:** max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)\n  - **but:** P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P\n  - **cond:** P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P\n  - **para:** P = para_P\n\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.06,\nP_or_Q: 0.49,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.49 + 0.06 - 0.15 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.15 - 1, 0) <= 0.06 <= min(0.40, 0.15) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.15) <= 0.49 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.15) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.49 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.06 / 0.15 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.06,\nP_or_Q: 0.49,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.45, "metadata": {"model": "gpt-4o", "timestamp": "2024-09-26T00:29:55.012451", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('483bd4b3-b789-4e35-aad5-d936b17751f8'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('623baf48-238f-465d-98c5-3e3e09f42623'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('a80a3247-ffad-4134-9d36-8427ebe6bb78'), title='Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, which is among the largest Bitcoin conferences, scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('8a34db40-54a8-4f15-89ca-c3e2cc3b63a0'), title='Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?', body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nMars is often disussed as a target for mass colonization and eventual terraforming, notably by SpaceX.

His appearance could generate significant media attention.\n- **Factors against:** Musk's busy schedule and potential for last-minute changes in plans. Additionally, his involvement in various ventures (SpaceX, Tesla, etc.) might limit his availability.\n\n### not_P: Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n- This is essentially the complement of P. If P has a certain probability, not_P is simply 1 - P.\n\n### para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n- This is a paraphrased version of P. Given that the events are described similarly, the probability should match P to maintain consistency.\n\n### Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n- **Factors in favor:** SpaceX's focus on Mars colonization, technological advancements, and potential international collaborations.\n- **Factors against:** Technical and logistical challenges, high costs, and potential geopolitical issues. The Moon's proximity to Earth might make it a more attractive initial target for permanent colonies.\n\n### P_and_Q: Will both Elon Musk attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n- This event requires both P and Q to occur. The probability should be lower than either individual event due to the need for both conditions to be met.\n\n### P_or_Q: Will either Elon Musk attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n- This event requires at least one of P or Q to occur. The probability should be higher than either individual event, as it covers more possible outcomes.\n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does and Elon Musk not attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n- This event requires Q to occur and P not to occur. The probability should be lower than Q alone due to the additional condition.\n\n### Q_given_P: Given that Elon Musk attends the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n- This is a conditional probability. Given P, we need to assess the likelihood of Q occurring. This should be similar to the probability of Q if P and Q are independent events.\n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n- **Independence:** P and Q are likely independent events. Elon Musk attending a Bitcoin conference has little to do with the colonization of Mars or the Moon. Thus, the probabilities should be calculated accordingly.\n\n### Consistency Rules:\n- **neg:** P + not_P = 1\n- **andor:** P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q\n- **and:** max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)\n- **or:** max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)\n- **but:** P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P\n- **cond:** P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P\n- **para:** P = para_P\n\nBy ensuring that the probabilities adhere to these consistency rules, we can maintain logical coherence in our predictions.\n\nP: 0.45\nnot_P: 0.55\npara_P: 0.45\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.09\nP_or_Q: 0.56\nQ_and_not_P: 0.11\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.45 = 1 - 0.55 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.45 = 0.56 + 0.09 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.45 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.09 <= min(0.45, 0.20) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.45, 0.20) <= 0.56 <= min(1, 0.45 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.45 = 0.56 - 0.11 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.45 \u2248 0.09 / 0.20 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.45 = 0.45 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.45\nnot_P: 0.55\npara_P: 0.45\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.09\nP_or_Q: 0.56\nQ_and_not_P: 0.11\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.45", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.022816012620947124, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.011408006310473562, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.21461445758452252, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

He has attended various conferences and events related to technology and finance.\n- **Factors against:** His schedule is extremely busy, and he might have other commitments during the event dates.\n\n#### not_P: Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n- This is simply the complement of P. If P happens, not_P does not, and vice versa.\n\n#### para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n- This question is essentially the same as P, as both resolve positively if Elon Musk attends the event. Therefore, para_P should have the same probability as P.\n\n#### Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n- **Factors in favor:** SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, has ambitious plans for Mars colonization. Technological advancements could accelerate this timeline.\n- **Factors against:** The Moon is closer to Earth, making it a more likely candidate for initial colonization efforts. Logistical challenges for Mars are significantly higher.\n\n#### P_and_Q: Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (2) Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 residents before the Moon?\n- This requires both P and Q to happen. The probability of this event should be lower than the probabilities of P and Q individually.\n\n#### P_or_Q: Will either of the following occur: (a) Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024? (b) Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n- This requires either P or Q or both to happen. The probability should be higher than the probabilities of P and Q individually.\n\n#### Q_and_not_P: Will both of the following occur: (1) Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does and (2) Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n- This requires Q to happen and P not to happen. The probability should be lower than the probabilities of Q and not_P individually.\n\n#### Q_given_P: Given that Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n- This is a conditional probability. If P happens, we need to assess the likelihood of Q happening given that P has occurred.\n\n### Consistency Rules:\n\n1. **neg:** P = 1 - not_P\n   - P and not_P should sum to 1.\n\n2. **andor:** P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q\n   - Ensures the relationship between P, Q, and their combinations.\n\n3. **and:** max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)\n   - Ensures P_and_Q is within the logical bounds.\n\n4. **or:** max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)\n   - Ensures P_or_Q is within the logical bounds.\n\n5. **but:** P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P\n   - Ensures the relationship between P, Q, and their combinations.\n\n6. **cond:** P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P\n   - Ensures the conditional probability is consistent.\n\n7. **para:** P = para_P\n   - Ensures the parallel question has the same probability as P.\n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n\n- P and Q are largely independent events. Elon Musk attending a conference does not directly influence the colonization of Mars or the Moon.\n- P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and Q_and_not_P are derived from the base probabilities of P and Q.\n- Q_given_P is a conditional probability, which depends on the relationship between P and Q.\n\nI will now proceed to estimate the probabilities for each variable and ensure they adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.40\nnot_P: 0.60\npara_P: 0.40\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.04\nP_or_Q: 0.46\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.46 + 0.04 - 0.10 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.04 <= min(0.40, 0.10) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.10) <= 0.46 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.10) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.46 - 0.06 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.04 / 0.10 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.40\nnot_P: 0.60\npara_P: 0.40\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.04\nP_or_Q: 0.46\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given his unpredictable nature, a probability of around 0.50 seems reasonable.\n\n2. **not_P**: Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n   - This is simply the complement of P, so it should be 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P**: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\n   - This is essentially the same as P, given the phrasing.\n\n4. **Q**: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\n   - This is a long-term prediction with many uncertainties. Given the current state of space exploration, a low probability like 0.10 seems reasonable.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: Will both P and Q occur?\n   - This is the intersection of two independent events, so it should be P * Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: Will either P or Q occur?\n   - This is the union of two events, so it should be P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: Will both Q and not_P occur?\n   - This is the intersection of Q and not_P, so it should be Q * not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: Given P, will Q occur?\n   - This is the conditional probability of Q given P, which should be P_and_Q / P.\n\n### Consistency Rules\n- **neg**: P = 1 - not_P\n- **andor**: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q\n- **and**: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)\n- **or**: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)\n- **but**: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P\n- **cond**: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P\n- **para**: P = para_P\n\nP: 0.50,\nnot_P: 0.50,\npara_P: 0.50,\nQ: 0.10,\nP_and_Q: 0.05,\nP_or_Q: 0.55,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.50 = 1 - 0.50 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.50 = 0.55 + 0.05 - 0.10 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.50 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.05 <= min(0.50, 0.10) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.50, 0.10) <= 0.55 <= min(1, 0.50 + 0.10) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.50 = 0.55 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.50 \u2248 0.05 / 0.10 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.50 = 0.50 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.50,\nnot_P: 0.50,\npara_P: 0.50,\nQ: 0.10,\nP_and_Q: 0.05,\nP_or_Q: 0.55,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05,\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.5", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.10536051565782589, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.052680257828912946, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4679509613087477, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
