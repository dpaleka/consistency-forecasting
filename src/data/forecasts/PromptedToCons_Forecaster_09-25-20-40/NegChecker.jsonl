If P is true, then not_P must be false, and vice versa. The probabilities for P and not_P must sum to 1. Therefore, if I estimate P to be 0.60, not_P would be 0.40.\n\n2. **Q**: The likelihood of the US conducting a nuclear test explosion before 2030 is independent of OpenAI's decisions regarding the report. Therefore, I can assign a separate probability to Q based on the current geopolitical climate and historical context.\n\n3. **P_and_Q**: This represents the joint probability of both events occurring. Since P and Q are independent, I can calculate this as P * Q. \n\n4. **P_or_Q**: This probability can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, which captures the likelihood of either event happening. \n\n5. **Q_and_not_P**: This captures the scenario where the US conducts a nuclear test while OpenAI does publish the report. This can be calculated similarly to P_and_Q, considering the independence of the events.\n\n6. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q occurring given that P is true. This may require a different estimate, as the context might change if OpenAI decides not to publish the report.\n\n7. **Consistency Checks**: The probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules provided. For example, the sum of P and not_P should equal 1, and the calculations for P_and_Q and P_or_Q must follow the mathematical rules defined.\n\nIn summary, I need to carefully assign probabilities to each question while ensuring that they adhere to the provided consistency rules, especially for the dependent events P and not_P, while considering the independence of Q.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.65 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.65 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.65 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.25 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T20:41:47.053099", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d2e909eb-342b-4a66-bfc2-28ddee86b078'), title='Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('c14bc07b-b903-4833-94df-8b2fd83a1515'), title='Will OpenAI publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('fda53dbc-6ee3-4953-b18a-1431e7091aae'), title='Is it possible that OpenAI will refrain from releasing a report detailing the findings from external red-teaming of their models for safety before June 30, 2024?', body='This question will be answered as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI has not made a *public* report available that includes the results from an *independent* entity evaluating the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('5b844cf7-6bcb-4678-864f-4e464dfc089a'), title='Will the US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively to verification of a nuclear explosion by the CTBTO, the UN, or if an official government statement from the US is issued confirming the test.

Therefore, the probability of P + not_P should equal 1.\n\n2. **para_P** is closely related to P and not_P, as it also concerns OpenAI's actions regarding report publication. Since it is framed as a possibility of P happening, its probability should align closely with P.\n\n3. **Q (US conducting a nuclear test)** is an independent event from P and not_P, but it will influence the combined events such as P_and_Q and P_or_Q. The probability of Q should be estimated based on historical data and current geopolitical factors.\n\n4. **P_and_Q** represents the joint occurrence of both P and Q. Its probability must be less than or equal to both P and Q, which implies that it should be calculated based on the likelihood of both events happening together.\n\n5. **P_or_Q** should be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle, ensuring it captures the probability of either P or Q happening without double-counting the overlap represented by P_and_Q.\n\n6. **Q_and_not_P** represents the situation where Q happens while P does not. This probability should reflect the likelihood of Q occurring while ensuring that it does not overlap with P.\n\n7. **Q_given_P** is a conditional probability and should reflect how likely Q is given that P is true. This requires a careful estimation based on historical data regarding nuclear tests and the context of OpenAI's actions.\n\nIn summary, the estimates should be coherent with the relationships defined by the consistency rules. For instance, if P is high, not_P must be low, and vice versa. The probabilities need to be adjusted to ensure they align with all consistency rules, especially the complementary nature of P and not_P, and the joint probabilities for P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.25,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.38 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.40,\nP_and_Q: 0.24,\nP_or_Q: 0.76,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16,\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.040821994520255034, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.020410997260127517, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28837490036423613, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

If one is true, the other must be false. Thus, if I estimate a probability for P, not_P must be calculated as 1 - P. This creates a clear relationship that must be maintained.\n\n2. **para_P**: This question is similar to P but framed in a way that considers the possibility of not releasing a report. Given that P and not_P are complementary, para_P should have a probability that reflects the uncertainty around P. If I estimate P at 0.73, I might set para_P at around 0.70 to reflect a slightly lower probability of them refraining from releasing a report.\n\n3. **Q**: This question about the US conducting a nuclear test is somewhat independent of the OpenAI questions, but it interacts with the other questions in the context of P_and_Q and P_or_Q. I might estimate Q at a lower probability, such as 0.25, reflecting current geopolitical tensions but also the historical context of the US's nuclear testing policies.\n\n4. **P_and_Q**: This question requires both P and Q to be true. Hence, I need to ensure that P_and_Q is less than or equal to both P and Q. I might estimate this at around 0.15, which would be a product of the individual probabilities adjusted for any correlation.\n\n5. **P_or_Q**: This question resolves positively if either P or Q is true.

This could be influenced by various factors such as organizational decisions or external pressures. \n- **not_P** is the opposite, indicating that OpenAI does publish such a report. The probability estimates for **P** and **not_P** should sum up to 1, since they are complementary events.\n\n### para_P \n- **para_P** is a parallel question to **P**, asking if it's possible for OpenAI to refrain from releasing a report. This is closely related to **P**, so we can expect similar probability estimates.\n\n### Q \n- **Q** concerns the likelihood of the US conducting a nuclear test explosion before 2030. This is a separate event but could be correlated with the outcome of **P** and **not_P** depending on geopolitical situations.\n\n### P_and_Q \n- This question combines both events, asking if OpenAI does not publish a report and the US conducts a nuclear test. The probability of this event should reflect the interaction between the two independent events, which can be calculated using the probabilities of **P** and **Q**.\n\n### P_or_Q \n- This question asks if either **P** or **Q** occurs. The probability should be calculated based on the individual probabilities of **P** and **Q** and their intersection. \n\n### Q_and_not_P \n- This event checks if both the US conducts a nuclear test and OpenAI publishes a report. This is an intersection of **Q** and **not_P** and should reflect the relationship between these two events.\n\n### Q_given_P \n- This conditional question asks about the probability of the US conducting a nuclear test given that OpenAI does not publish a report. This is important for understanding how the two events might influence each other. \n\n### Independence and Relationships\n- **P** and **Q** are independent events; the outcome of one does not directly affect the other. However, they may have contextual relationships, as public perception or policy decisions could be influenced by either event. \n\n### Consistency Rules\n- The probabilities should adhere to the consistency rules, particularly regarding complementary events (P and not_P) and the relationships defined by logical operators (and, or, etc.). \n- I will ensure that the probabilities assigned to these events are in accordance with these rules to maintain logical coherence.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.15 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and:  andor, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.11766968015078105, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.058834840075390527, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4985713440139751, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given the increasing scrutiny on AI models and the potential backlash from not publishing, I estimate a moderate probability that they will not publish a report by June 30, 2024. \n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI publishing a report)**: This is the complementary event to P, and thus its probability can be derived from P. If P is estimated at 0.6, then not_P would be 0.4.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of OpenAI refraining from releasing a report)**: This is closely related to P. Given the context, I would estimate this probability to be similar to P, as both events reflect the same underlying situation.\n\n4. **Q (US conducting a nuclear test)**: This event has a low probability given the current geopolitical climate and the US's commitments to nuclear non-proliferation. However, there are factors that could influence this, such as international tensions. I would estimate this at a low probability.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This is a joint probability and would naturally be lower than the individual probabilities of P and Q. I would estimate this based on the multiplication of the individual probabilities, considering their independence.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability would be higher than both individual probabilities, as it includes scenarios where either P or Q occurs. This would be calculated using the formula for the union of two probabilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US conducting a nuclear test while OpenAI publishes a report)**: This is another joint event, and its probability would also be relatively low, as it requires both conditions to be met.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (US conducting a nuclear test given OpenAI does not publish)**: This conditional probability would depend on the likelihood of Q occurring under the assumption that P is true.\n\nOverall, I would ensure that all the probabilities adhere to the defined consistency rules, such as ensuring that the complementary probabilities add up to 1, and that joint probabilities are calculated correctly. The relationship between P and Q is important, as they may be influenced by external factors such as public opinion and international relations.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.09,\nP_or_Q: 0.66,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06,\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.66 + 0.09 - 0.15 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.15 - 1, 0) <= 0.09 <= min(0.60, 0.15) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.15) <= 0.66 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.15) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.66 - 0.06 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.09 / 0.10 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.09,\nP_or_Q: 0.66,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06,\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "fcbabe15-5125-49be-a55c-0f008e88035f", "title": "At the Paris Summer Olympics in 2024, will the men's 100m dash winning time not break the Olympic record of 9.63s?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if no athlete runs the Men's 100M race at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics in less than 9.63s, according to results posted by the [International Olympic Committee](https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/olympic-results) or credible sources.

If one occurs, the other cannot. This relationship will be crucial in determining the probabilities assigned to each. \n\n2. **para_P** is closely related to **P** and **not_P**. It asks if it is possible for OpenAI to refrain from releasing a report, which aligns with the negative outcome of **not_P**. Therefore, the probability of **para_P** should reflect the same sentiment as **P**. \n\n3. **Q** (US conducting a nuclear test explosion) is independent of **P** and **not_P**. However, both events can influence the combined probabilities of **P_and_Q** (both events occurring) and **P_or_Q** (either event occurring). \n\n4. **P_and_Q** will depend on the probabilities of both **P** and **Q** occurring simultaneously. Given that they are independent, we can calculate this as the product of their individual probabilities. \n\n5. **P_or_Q** will take into account the probabilities of either event occurring, which must be calculated carefully to avoid double-counting the scenario where both occur. \n\n6. **Q_and_not_P** examines the scenario where the US conducts a nuclear test while OpenAI publishes a report. This is a specific combination of events that will also be influenced by the probabilities of **Q** and **not_P**. \n\n7. **Q_given_P** looks at the conditional probability of the US conducting a nuclear test given that OpenAI does not publish a report. This will require understanding how the occurrence of **P** might influence the likelihood of **Q**. \n\nIn summary, the probabilities will need to be assigned in such a way that they respect the relationships and dependencies outlined above, ensuring that all consistency rules are adhered to.\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.65 + 0.10 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.40, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.25) <= 0.65 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.25) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.65 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.10 / 0.30 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.40,\nnot_P: 0.60,\npara_P: 0.40,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.65,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

If P is true, then not_P must be false and vice versa. This relationship ensures that the probabilities of P and not_P must sum to 1. \n\n2. **para_P** is a paraphrased version of P, so it should have the same probability as P. This means that if I estimate P to be a certain probability, para_P should reflect that same probability. \n\n3. **Q (US conducting a nuclear test explosion)** is independent of P and not_P. The events are not directly related, but they can influence the overall context of the questions. The probability of Q needs to be estimated based on geopolitical factors and historical context. \n\n4. **P_and_Q** indicates the occurrence of both P and Q. The probability of this event can be calculated using the multiplication rule for independent events. However, since P and Q are not completely independent (the public perception of OpenAI's actions could influence the US's actions), I will consider a correlation factor when estimating this probability. \n\n5. **P_or_Q** indicates that at least one of the two events occurs.

A higher probability might suggest that OpenAI will likely not publish the report, potentially due to internal policies or strategic decisions.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the opposite of P, indicating that OpenAI will publish the report. The sum of P and not_P should equal 1, which is a fundamental consistency rule.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P but framed in a different context. Since it asks if it is possible that OpenAI will refrain from releasing the report, it should align closely with P, as both address the same event from different angles.\n\n4. **Q**: This question concerns the potential for the US to conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030. Given the political climate and international treaties, I would assess the probability based on historical context and current geopolitical tensions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question combines P and Q, meaning both events must occur for it to resolve positively. The probability of this event should be less than or equal to the individual probabilities of P and Q, as both must happen simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This question resolves positively if either P or Q occurs. The probability of this should be at least as high as the higher of the two individual probabilities but not exceed 1.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question combines Q with the negation of P, meaning it resolves positively if the US conducts a nuclear test and OpenAI publishes the report. This would likely have a lower probability than Q alone, as it requires two specific outcomes.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional question assesses the likelihood of Q occurring given that P is true. The relationship here indicates that if OpenAI does not publish the report, it may influence the likelihood of a US nuclear test.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationships between these questions indicate that P and not_P are directly linked and must sum to 1. The events in Q and the combinations of P with Q will also influence the overall probabilities. I will ensure that the probabilities assigned adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.73,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This estimate is based on current trends in corporate transparency and the potential risks associated with releasing sensitive information.\n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI publishing a report)**: This probability is 0.35, which is complementary to P. It reflects a lower likelihood that OpenAI will decide to publish the report.\n\n3. **Q (US conducting a nuclear test explosion)**: I assigned a probability of 0.30 to this event, which indicates a cautious view of the likelihood of the US conducting a nuclear test. Given the current geopolitical climate and the historical context of nuclear testing, this estimate seems reasonable.\n\n4. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: I estimated this at 0.20, which reflects the joint occurrence of both events. This probability is lower than either P or Q individually, indicating that while both could happen, they are not highly likely to occur together.\n\n5. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: This is estimated at 0.75, suggesting that it is quite likely that at least one of these events will take place. This reflects an increased chance given the independent nature of the two events.\n\n6. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring while not P)**: I assigned a probability of 0.15 to this combination, indicating a lower likelihood that the US conducts a nuclear test while OpenAI does not publish a report. This reflects the independent nature of the two events but recognizes that they can occur simultaneously.\n\n7. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given that P is true)**: This is estimated at 0.25, indicating that if OpenAI does not publish the report, there is still a reasonable chance that the US could conduct a nuclear test. This reflects the conditional relationship between these events.\n\n8. **para_P (Parallel event to P)**: I kept this at 0.65, consistent with the estimate for P, reinforcing that the likelihood of OpenAI not publishing the report is significant.\n\n### Independence and Relationships:\n- The events P and Q are largely independent; the occurrence of one does not directly influence the other. However, the probabilities assigned to Q_given_P suggest a potential conditional relationship worth exploring further.\n\n### Consistency with Rules:\n- The estimates need to be checked against the consistency rules to ensure that they do not contradict any logical relationships outlined in the rules. In particular, I will need to ensure that the probabilities for P and not_P adhere to the negation rule, and that the joint probabilities for P_and_Q, Q_and_not_P, and others align with the rules governing conjunction and disjunction.\n\nOverall, the estimates reflect a careful consideration of the events and their likelihoods, taking into account the current context and potential future developments.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.20,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.25,\npara_P: 0.65\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\nQ: 0.30,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15,\nQ_given_P: 0.25,\npara_P: 0.65\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "d3664c64-918c-48ec-aee0-55b04e941328", "title": "Will OpenAI's ChatGPT not be generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024?", "body": "The question resolves as **YES** if [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) is not generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, and **NO** otherwise.\n\n\"Generally available\" here means that the default state for people in the EU is that they cannot access it without a VPN (possibly requiring paying for it.)

The events are interrelated, particularly the questions regarding OpenAI's report and the US nuclear tests, which can influence each other. \n\n1. **P (OpenAI not publishing a report)**: This event is likely influenced by OpenAI's internal decision-making and public relations strategies. Given the increasing scrutiny on AI safety, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.60 for this event. \n\n2. **not_P (OpenAI publishing a report)**: This is the complement of P, so I estimate it as 0.40 (1 - P). \n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of OpenAI refraining from releasing a report)**: This is similar to P, and I estimate it at 0.60 as well, reflecting the same reasoning. \n\n4. **Q (US conducting a nuclear test)**: This is a highly sensitive geopolitical issue. Given the current international relations and the US's historical stance, I estimate a low probability of 0.20 for this event. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events happening)**: This is the joint probability of P and Q occurring. Given the independence of the two events, I estimate this at 0.12 (P * Q). \n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one of the two events occurring)**: This combines the probabilities of P and Q, and I estimate it at 0.68 (P + Q - P_and_Q). \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (US nuclear test and OpenAI publishing a report)**: This is less likely since if OpenAI publishes a report, it might imply that they are more open about their practices, which could influence perceptions about nuclear testing. I estimate this at 0.08. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (US nuclear test given OpenAI does not publish a report)**: This is a conditional probability. Given that OpenAI's decision may not directly influence the US's actions, I estimate this at 0.15.\n\nOverall, the relationship between these events is complex, with the potential for external factors to influence the outcomes. The probabilities assigned reflect a cautious outlook on both OpenAI's transparency and the geopolitical landscape regarding nuclear testing.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.68 + 0.12 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.12 <= min(0.60, 0.20) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.20) <= 0.68 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.68 - 0.08 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.12 / 0.15 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.20,\nP_and_Q: 0.12,\nP_or_Q: 0.68,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.08,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.06471682202218476, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03235841101109238, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.36524578353570125, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
