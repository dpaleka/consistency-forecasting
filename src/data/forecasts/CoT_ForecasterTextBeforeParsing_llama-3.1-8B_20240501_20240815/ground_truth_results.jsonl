Firstly, the question explicitly mentions five of Donald Trump's children (Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Tiffany Trump, and Barron Trump) and his wife Melania Trump as potential candidates. This suggests that the question is focused on the Trump family's involvement in the 2024 presidential election. However, the question does not provide any information about the likelihood of the Trump family members running for the presidency. To assess the likelihood of a Trump family member becoming the Republican nominee, I will consider their past political involvement and popularity. Donald Trump, the current President, has a history of running for and winning the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Although he has not officially announced his candidacy for 2024, there is speculation that he might run again. Donald Trump Jr. has been involved in politics and has spoken at Republican National Conventions, but it is unclear if he will run for the presidency. Eric Trump has been involved in various business ventures and has not been as actively involved in politics as his father or brother. It is possible but less likely that he will run for the presidency. Ivanka Trump has been involved in politics, serving as a senior advisor to her father during his presidency. However, she has not expressed interest in running for the presidency. Tiffany Trump has not been actively involved in politics and has focused on her education and career. Barron Trump is the youngest child and has not been involved in politics. Melania Trump has been involved in various charitable and public activities as the First Lady, but there is no indication that she will run for the presidency. Considering these factors, I estimate that the likelihood of a Trump family member being the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 is relatively low, but not impossible.

Previous Presidential Campaign Experience: While Donald Trump Jr. has not run for president before, he has been involved in various business ventures and has been a vocal supporter of his father's policies. This experience and familiarity with the political landscape might help him navigate the nomination process. 4. Competition and Field of Candidates: The Republican field for the 2024 nomination is not yet fully established, but it's likely to be crowded. Donald Trump Jr.'s family name and connections might give him an edge in securing the nomination. 5. Recent Polls and Sentiment: Recent polls and sentiment analysis might provide some insight into the public's perception of Donald Trump Jr. as a potential candidate. However, these can be volatile and subject to change. Considering these factors, while Donald Trump Jr. has some advantages due to his family ties and potential popularity, the Republican nomination process is inherently unpredictable and influenced by many variables, including the preferences of party delegates, campaign strategies, and external events."}, "prob": 0.15}, "prob": 0.15, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.2345, "brier_score": 0.0225, "brier_score_scaled": 91.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6587, "calibrated_prob": 0.2228, "brier_score": 0.0496, "brier_score_scaled": 80.2, "log_score": 0.3636}}

Firstly, the European Parliament elections are typically held every five years, and the 2024 elections will be the ninth parliamentary term. Historically, the S&D has been one of the largest groups in the European Parliament, but its performance has varied across different elections. In the 2019 European Parliament elections, the S&D lost 41 seats, dropping from 186 seats to 145 seats. However, this decline was largely due to the rise of nationalist and populist parties across Europe. Looking ahead to the 2024 elections, there are several factors that could impact the S&D's performance. On the one hand, the S&D has been working to rebrand itself and appeal to a broader range of voters. The group has also been vocal on key issues such as climate change, social justice, and economic inequality, which may resonate with voters. On the other hand, the S&D faces challenges from both the left and the right. The rise of the Greens and other left-wing parties could siphon off support from the S&D, while the continued popularity of nationalist and populist parties could erode the S&D's traditional base. In terms of specific polling data, it's difficult to say with certainty how the S&D will perform in the 2024 elections. However, some recent polls suggest that the S&D is still one of the most popular groups in the European Parliament, with support ranging from 20-30% across different countries. Taking all of these factors into account, I would estimate that the probability of the S&D holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections is around 40%.

It is plausible that Anthropic would engage in external red-teaming to ensure the safety of their models. 2. Industry Standards and Best Practices: In the AI safety community, transparency and open communication about the safety and robustness of AI models are highly valued. Publishing the results of external red-teaming would be in line with these standards and best practices. 3. Previous Actions and Communication: Without specific information about Anthropic's past practices regarding red-teaming or publishing safety-related reports, it is uncertain how they would approach such a situation. However, the fact that they are a company focused on AI safety suggests they might be inclined to engage in and report on external red-teaming. 4. Timeline and Feasibility: The timeline of June 30, 2024, is relatively close, which suggests that Anthropic might have enough time to conduct external red-teaming and prepare a report for publication. However, the complexity of the task, the availability of external teams for red-teaming, and the resources required to publish a report could influence the feasibility of meeting this timeline. 5. Lack of Direct Information: There is no direct information provided about Anthropic's current plans or intentions regarding external red-teaming and publishing the results. This lack of information makes it challenging to estimate the likelihood of the event occurring.

The Miami Heat have a decent chance of making it to the playoffs, but winning the championship is a tall order.

A well-coached team with good chemistry and leadership can perform better than a team with poor leadership and dynamics. 5.

If there is a consistent pattern of peaks occurring within four weeks of each other, it would increase the likelihood of this happening in the 2023-24 season.

Tyson Fury is a skilled boxer with a strong record, having held the WBC and The Ring heavyweight titles.

Given that the question resolves as Yes if Georgia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced as qualified by the EBU, I need to assess the likelihood of these two conditions being met. Firstly, Georgia's participation in a Semi-final is a necessary condition for them to qualify for the Grand Final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) typically announces the participating countries for the Semi-finals and the Grand Final in advance. Since Georgia has participated in Eurovision in previous years, it is reasonable to assume that they will participate in 2024. However, without explicit information on their participation, I will consider it a likely but not certain event. Secondly, the EBU's qualification process involves a voting system where countries that receive the most votes from a combination of jury and public votes in their respective Semi-finals qualify for the Grand Final. Given that Georgia has a dedicated fanbase and has performed well in previous Eurovision competitions, it is plausible that they could receive enough votes to qualify for the Grand Final. However, the outcome of the voting process is inherently uncertain and influenced by various factors such as voting patterns, competition from other countries, and the quality of their entry. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of Georgia qualifying for the Grand Final as follows: The probability of Georgia participating in a Semi-final is around 0.9 (or 90%), as they have a history of participation and it is a necessary condition for them to qualify for the Grand Final. The probability of Georgia being officially announced as qualified for the Grand Final by the EBU, given that they participate in a Semi-final, is around 0.6 (or 60%). This is because while Georgia has a good chance of qualifying, the outcome of the voting process is uncertain and influenced by various factors. To calculate the overall probability of Georgia qualifying for the Grand Final, I will multiply the probabilities of these two conditions: 0.9 * 0.6 = 0.54 or 54%.

However, the country's performance has been inconsistent, and it's difficult to predict their chances of qualifying in 2024. Assuming that Iceland will participate in a Semi-final, which is a necessary condition for the question to resolve as 'Yes', I would estimate the probability of them being officially announced as having qualified for the Grand Final as around 20-30%.

However, there are also reasons to be cautious. A deadly attack would likely have significant diplomatic and strategic consequences for Israel, including potential retaliation from Iran and its allies. This could lead Israel to opt for more measured responses, such as cyberattacks or sabotage, rather than a large-scale military operation. Additionally, the current international landscape, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the fragile global economy, might lead Israel to prioritize other security concerns over a potentially risky operation within Iran.

International Criminal Court's (ICC) past actions: The ICC has issued arrest warrants for several high-profile individuals, including Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony. However, these cases were often related to serious crimes committed in countries not party to the Rome Statute, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. In contrast, the Israeli leaders in question are from a country that has signed the Rome Statute, but has also taken steps to withdraw from the ICC's jurisdiction. 2. Current tensions between Israel and the ICC: The ICC has been investigating alleged war crimes committed by Israel in the Palestinian territories since 2019. However, the ICC has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation, with some accusing it of bias against Israel. This tension might affect the ICC's willingness to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. 3. The ICC's jurisdiction and the Israeli leaders' actions: The ICC's jurisdiction is based on the principle of complementarity, which means that it only intervenes when national courts are unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute serious crimes. The Israeli leaders in question have been involved in various controversies, including the Gaza conflict and settlement expansion, but it's unclear whether these actions would fall within the ICC's jurisdiction. 4. The ICC's recent decisions and trends: In recent years, the ICC has faced criticism for its slow pace of investigations and prosecutions. The court has also been struggling with issues related to its jurisdiction, particularly in cases involving non-state actors. These challenges might affect the ICC's ability to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. 5. The resolution date and the ICC's typical decision-making process: The resolution date is set for July 1, 2024, which is relatively close. The ICC typically takes several months to a few years to issue arrest warrants, so it's possible that the court might issue a warrant before the resolution date. Considering these factors, I believe that the probability of the ICC issuing arrest warrants for any of the listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024, is relatively low.

However, the likelihood of an attack depends on various factors, including the military capabilities of the parties involved, their willingness to engage in such an attack, and the effectiveness of any potential defenses. There are a few points in favor of the bridge being attacked: 1. The Crimean Bridge has been a strategic target for Ukraine and its allies, and there have been previous attempts to damage or destroy it. 2. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has led to a heightened state of alertness and increased military activity in the region. 3. The bridge's importance as a transportation artery for Russian troops and supplies makes it a valuable target for Ukraine and its allies. On the other hand, there are also points against the bridge being attacked: 1. Russia has taken significant steps to secure the bridge, including deploying military personnel and equipment to protect it. 2. The bridge's design and construction make it a challenging target for attacks, particularly from the air. 3. The potential consequences of an attack on the bridge, including civilian casualties and economic disruption, might deter Ukraine and its allies from launching such an attack. Considering these factors, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that the likelihood of the Crimean Bridge being hit with an attack before July 1, 2024, is higher than not.

The International Seabed Authority is a specialized agency of the United Nations that governs the use of the ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction. The Secretary-General is elected by the Authority's Assembly, which consists of representatives from its 167 member states. Given the lack of specific information about the candidates running in the July elections and the competitive nature of such elections, it's difficult to make an informed prediction. However, I can consider some general factors that might influence the outcome. One factor is the incumbent's performance and popularity among the member states. If Michael Lodge has been effective in his role and has the support of key member states, he might have an advantage in the election. On the other hand, if there are concerns about his leadership or if other candidates have emerged with strong backing, this could impact his chances of re-election. Another factor is the political dynamics within the International Seabed Authority. Are there any major factions or alliances that could influence the election outcome? Are there any specific issues or controversies that might impact the vote? Without access to specific information about the election campaign, the candidates, and the voting dynamics, it's challenging to provide a precise probability.

His popularity has been a subject of debate, with some polls indicating a decline in his approval ratings. However, it's essential to note that popularity is not the only factor in determining election outcomes. 2. Election history: Rishi Sunak has been a Member of Parliament (MP) since 2015 and has been a Cabinet Minister. He has a strong track record of winning elections, including the 2019 general election. While past performance is not a guarantee of future success, it does indicate his ability to connect with voters. 3. Party dynamics: The Conservative Party, of which Rishi Sunak is a member, has faced internal challenges and divisions in recent times. However, Sunak has managed to maintain a strong grip on the party leadership. The opposition parties, particularly Labour, will likely face challenges in unseating Conservative MPs, including Sunak. 4. Election timing: The 2024 general election will take place in July, which is relatively late in the year. This could impact voter turnout and potentially favor the incumbent government. Additionally, the summer months often see a decrease in voter engagement, which might benefit the status quo. 5. Governing performance: The current Conservative government has faced criticism for its handling of various issues, including the economy, healthcare, and the cost of living. However, the opposition parties have not been able to capitalize on these criticisms fully, and the government has made efforts to address some of these concerns. 6. Rishi Sunak's campaign: As a seasoned politician, Sunak will likely run a strong campaign, leveraging his experience and connections to connect with voters. His campaign will also be supported by the Conservative Party's resources and infrastructure.

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\n\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\n\n>Tesla\u2019s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\n\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\n\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\n\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\n\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\n\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\n\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has [advised](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1) shareholders *not* to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\n\n---------------------\n\nSee related question:\n\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)"}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To determine the probability that Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) will advise Tesla shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $57 billion package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk, I consider the following factors: 1.

The size and scope of Elon Musk's pay package: The $57 billion package is a significant compensation award that has been the subject of controversy and scrutiny. ISS may view this as a high-risk, high-reward proposal that warrants careful consideration. 3. ISS's voting history: ISS has a history of advising against large compensation packages, especially those that are perceived as excessive or poorly aligned with shareholder interests. 4. The re-election of Kimbal Musk: Kimbal Musk is Elon Musk's brother and a member of the Tesla board of directors. ISS may view his re-election as a potential conflict of interest or a sign of insider favoritism. Given these factors, I believe that ISS is likely to advise against Elon Musk's pay package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk.

Firstly, the current political landscape in Hungary is dominated by the Fidesz-KDNP alliance, which has been in power since 2010. However, the opposition has been gaining momentum in recent years, with several opposition parties, including the United for Hungary (EPP), the Democratic Coalition, and the Momentum Movement, presenting a united front against the current government. The opposition has been actively campaigning and has gained popularity, particularly among younger voters and those dissatisfied with the current government's policies. Secondly, the European Parliament elections are typically less about domestic issues and more about EU-wide politics. The Fidesz-KDNP alliance has been a vocal critic of the EU's policies and has been at odds with the EU's institutions, which may harm its chances of winning over EU-wide support. Thirdly, the 2024 European Parliament elections will be held in May 2024, which means the campaign will take place during an uncertain time for the global economy, with the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential energy crises. This could lead to a shift in voter priorities and potentially benefit parties that are seen as more competent in handling economic issues. Considering these factors, while Fidesz-KDNP has a strong base of support in Hungary, the opposition's growing popularity and the uncertain global economic climate may pose a challenge to the alliance's chances of maintaining its EU plurality. However, it's also worth noting that the Fidesz-KDNP alliance has a well-organized machinery and a strong grassroots support, which could help it maintain its position.

AI companies themselves have acknowledged these risks [1, 2, 3], as have governments across the world [4, 5, 6] and other AI experts [7, 8, 9].\n\n> We are hopeful that these risks can be adequately mitigated with sufficient guidance from the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. However, AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.\n\n> AI companies possess substantial non-public information about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the adequacy of their protective measures, and the risk levels of different kinds of harm. However, they currently have only weak obligations to share some of this information with governments, and none with civil society. We do not think they can all be relied upon to share it voluntarily.\n\n> So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public. Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues. Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated. Some of us reasonably fear various forms of retaliation, given the history of such cases across the industry. We are not the first to encounter or speak about these issues.\n\n> **We therefore call upon advanced AI companies to commit to these principles.**\n\n> 1. **That the company will not enter into or enforce** any agreement that prohibits \u201cdisparagement\u201d or criticism of the company for risk-related concerns, nor retaliate for risk-related criticism by hindering any vested economic benefit;\n2. **That the company will facilitate a verifiably anonymous process** for current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise;\n3. **That the company will support a culture of open criticism** and allow its current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns about its technologies to the public, to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, or to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise, so long as trade secrets and other intellectual property interests are appropriately protected;\n4. **That the company will not retaliate against current and former employees who publicly share risk-related confidential information after other processes have failed.** We accept that any effort to report risk-related concerns should avoid releasing confidential information unnecessarily. Therefore, once an adequate process for anonymously raising concerns to the company\u2019s board, to regulators, and to an appropriate independent organization with relevant expertise exists, we accept that concerns should be raised through such a process initially.

A brokered convention typically occurs when no candidate has secured the majority of delegates before the convention, leading to multiple rounds of voting. This can happen if there are several strong candidates with a significant number of delegates, or if a clear frontrunner emerges but falls short of the majority. Several factors suggest that a brokered convention is possible: 1. Large field of candidates: The Democratic primary field has been relatively large, with multiple candidates vying for the nomination. This increases the likelihood that no single candidate will secure the majority of delegates early on. 2. Divided party: The Democratic Party has been experiencing internal divisions, particularly between moderate and progressive wings. This could lead to a split vote, making it harder for a single candidate to secure the majority. 3. Uncertainty around frontrunners: While some candidates have been performing well in polls, there is still uncertainty around their ability to secure the majority of delegates. A strong candidate may face challenges in securing support from all factions within the party. 4. Delegate math: The Democratic Party's delegate allocation rules can create complexities, particularly if multiple candidates are competitive in different states. This could lead to a situation where no candidate has a clear path to securing the majority of delegates. However, there are also factors that suggest a brokered convention is less likely: 1. Early voting states: The early voting states, such as Iowa and New Hampshire, have often played a crucial role in narrowing the field. If a clear frontrunner emerges from these states, it could reduce the likelihood of a brokered convention. 2. National polls: National polls have shown a relatively stable picture, with a few candidates consistently performing well. This could indicate that the party is coalescing around a single candidate. 3. Party machinery: The Democratic Party has a well-organized machinery, which can help to support a clear frontrunner and reduce the likelihood of a brokered convention. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of a brokered convention is relatively high, but not guaranteed.

However, not all of these countries have participated in the Olympics or have a chance to win a medal. We can assume that around 100-150 countries have a realistic chance of winning a medal, given their sporting capabilities and past performances. Historically, around 10-20 countries win their first Olympic medal every 4 years. This means that the probability of a country winning its first Olympic medal is relatively low, around 5-10%. Assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of countries winning their first medal, we can estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their first medal. Using a Poisson distribution with a mean of 15 (the average number of countries winning their first medal), we can calculate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their first medal. This probability is approximately 0.23. However, this calculation assumes that the number of countries winning their first medal follows a Poisson distribution, which may not be the case. There may be some countries that are more likely to win their first medal due to their sporting capabilities or past performances. To account for this, we can use a more conservative estimate of 5-7 countries winning their first medal, which is a common range cited in the literature.

Frequency of strong geomagnetic storms: According to historical data, strong geomagnetic storms (Kp > 4) occur relatively frequently, but extremely strong storms (Kp > 5) are less common. 2. Solar activity: The Sun's activity can influence the occurrence of geomagnetic storms. During periods of high solar activity, the likelihood of strong geomagnetic storms increases. 3. Geomagnetic storm patterns: Geomagnetic storms can follow specific patterns, such as the recurrence of storms during periods of high solar activity. However, these patterns are not always predictable. 4. Recent solar activity: As the question is specific to July 17-28, 2024, I'll consider recent solar activity leading up to this period.

Geomagnetic storm frequency and intensity: Geomagnetic storms are caused by solar activity, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The frequency and intensity of these events can vary significantly over time, with some periods being more active than others. However, predicting the exact timing and strength of individual storms is challenging. 2. K-index distribution: The K-index is a 3-hourly index that measures the geomagnetic disturbance level. A K-index of 4 indicates a moderate geomagnetic storm, while a K-index of 6 indicates a strong storm. The distribution of K-index values can be skewed, with more frequent moderate storms and fewer extreme ones. 3. Seasonal and solar cycle variations: Geomagnetic storms are more frequent and intense during the solar maximum phase of the 11-year solar cycle. Since the current solar cycle is in a declining phase, we might expect fewer intense storms. 4.

Firstly, 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is a new movie that has not yet been released, so its domestic box office opening is not yet known. However, we can look at the box office performance of its predecessors, 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine', to get an idea of the potential performance of the new movie. Both 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' were successful movies, with 'Deadpool' grossing $132,434,639 and 'The Wolverine' grossing $53,113,752. The combined box office opening of these two movies is $185,548,391. However, it's essential to note that 'Deadpool' was a critical and commercial success, known for its unique blend of action, comedy, and satire, which appealed to a wide audience. The movie's success can be attributed to its well-developed characters, witty dialogue, and the chemistry between the lead actors, Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin. On the other hand, 'The Wolverine' was also a successful movie, but its box office performance was not as high as 'Deadpool'. However, it's worth noting that 'The Wolverine' was released in 2013, a time when the movie landscape was different, and the box office was not as crowded as it is today. Considering these factors, it's challenging to predict the box office performance of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' with certainty. However, if we look at the trend of the 'X-Men' franchise, which has seen a decline in box office performance over the years, it's possible that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' might not perform as well as its predecessors. Additionally, the movie's marketing campaign and the current movie landscape will also play a significant role in determining its box office performance. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of the domestic box office opening of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' being higher than the combined box office openings of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' as 0.2.

In fact, history suggests that it's not uncommon for athletes to win multiple medals in the Olympics. For example, in the 2012 London Olympics, Rafael Nadal won two gold medals in tennis.

Firstly, historical data from previous Olympics suggests that the USA has a strong track record of winning a significant number of Gold medals, often more than Silver medals. However, this is not a guarantee, and the outcome can be influenced by various factors such as team dynamics, competition from other countries, and the specific events in which the USA excels. Given the uncertainty surrounding the performance of the USA Olympic Team at the Paris 2024 Olympics, I will consider the overall performance of the US Olympic Team in previous Olympics as a rough guide. According to the Olympic Games' official website, the USA has consistently won more Gold medals than Silver medals in the past few Olympics. For instance, at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the USA won 39 Gold medals and 41 Silver medals. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the USA won 46 Gold medals and 37 Silver medals. While these results are not definitive indicators of future performance, they suggest that the USA has a strong foundation for winning Gold medals. Additionally, the Paris 2024 Olympics will feature a diverse range of events, and the USA has a well-established program for developing and supporting Olympic athletes across various disciplines. Furthermore, the USA has a strong Olympic committee and a robust system for selecting and training its athletes, which should help to ensure that the team is well-prepared for the competition. However, it's also worth noting that other countries, such as China and Great Britain, have been increasingly competitive in recent Olympics, and there may be events where the USA faces stiff competition from other nations. Considering these factors, I believe that the USA has a reasonable chance of winning more Gold than Silver medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, but there is still a degree of uncertainty involved."}, "prob": 0.65}, "prob": 0.65, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.5146, "brier_score": 0.4225, "brier_score_scaled": -69.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6587, "calibrated_prob": 0.4295, "brier_score": 0.1845, "brier_score_scaled": 26.2, "log_score": 0.8098}}

However, it's essential to note that the USA's performance in the Olympics can be highly variable from one event to another, and even within the same Olympics, the country's medal count can fluctuate significantly between different events. Another crucial factor to consider is the strength of the USA's Olympic teams in different sports. The USA has historically excelled in sports like swimming, gymnastics, and track and field, where they often have a strong presence and a high likelihood of winning medals. However, in other sports, the USA's performance may be less consistent. Given the uncertainty surrounding the USA's performance in various sports and events, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction about their medal count. However, we can make an educated estimate based on historical trends and the USA's overall performance in the Olympics. Historically, the USA has won more Gold medals than Silver medals in the Olympics, but this is not always the case. In some Olympics, the USA has won more Silver medals than Gold medals.

Additionally, Iran may be deterred by the potential for severe repercussions from Israel and its allies, particularly the United States.

Firstly, we need to check the current Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model. However, since we cannot access real-time data, we'll proceed with a hypothetical scenario based on the given conditions. Assuming Nate Silver's model is dynamic and updates in real-time, the probability of Harris's odds increasing over the next week would depend on various factors such as changes in polling data, voter sentiment, and other economic or political events that might affect the election. Given that the resolution is based on a specific probability threshold (46.6%) at a particular time (Friday, August 9th, at 8:40 PM), we would need to know the current probability of Harris winning in Nate Silver's model to assess the likelihood of it increasing over the next week. However, since we cannot access real-time data, we can make an educated guess. If Nate Silver's model is accurate and reflects the current state of the election, it's possible that the probability of Harris winning could fluctuate due to various factors. But without knowing the current probability, it's challenging to provide a precise estimate. That being said, Nate Silver's model is known for its accuracy, and he often updates his predictions based on new data and analysis. Therefore, it's possible that the probability of Harris's odds increasing over the next week could be relatively high, especially if there are significant changes in polling data or other factors that might affect the election."}, "prob": 0.6}, "prob": 0.6, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.737, "brier_score": 0.16, "brier_score_scaled": 36.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6587, "calibrated_prob": 0.4167, "brier_score": 0.3403, "brier_score_scaled": -36.1, "log_score": 1.263}}

Current market trends: The domestic box office has been affected by various factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in consumer behavior, and the rise of streaming services. However, it's difficult to predict how these trends will impact the opening weekend of 'Trap' specifically. 4. Lack of information about 'Trap': There is limited information available about 'Trap', making it challenging to assess its potential box office performance. The lack of a trailer, marketing campaign, or buzz surrounding the film makes it harder to estimate its opening weekend gross. Considering these factors, I believe that while 'Trap' may have some potential, the lack of information and mixed results from Shyamalan's recent films make it difficult to predict a strong opening weekend.

Shonen Jump is a weekly manga magazine that releases new chapters on a regular basis, usually with a consistent schedule. However, the publication schedule can be affected by various factors such as the manga's popularity, the creator's workload, and the magazine's overall content strategy. Given that the question is asking about a break after chapter 44, I'll look for precedents in the series' past publication history. Since I don't have direct access to the specific publication dates and schedules of Kagurabachi, I'll consider general trends in Shonen Jump's publication practices. In general, Shonen Jump tends to release chapters regularly without breaks, except for special circumstances such as the creator's health issues, changes in the story's direction, or significant events that require a temporary halt in the series' publication. However, even in these cases, the breaks are usually announced in advance, and the magazine provides updates to its readers. Since the question mentions that it will be closed on the official release of chapter 44 and will be closed earlier if known-accurate leakers post any details about a break ahead of time, I'll consider the likelihood of a break being announced in advance. Given these factors, I would estimate that a break between chapters 44 and 45 is unlikely, as Shonen Jump tends to maintain a consistent publication schedule without unannounced breaks.

This suggests that they are likely to be among the top contenders in the race. However, the Olympic Road Race is a highly unpredictable event, with many variables that can affect the outcome, such as the course terrain, weather conditions, team strategies, and individual riders' performances on the day. The fact that both riders are from the same country (Belgium) and have a history of competing against each other in various events, including the Tour de France, means that they are likely to be familiar with each other's strengths and weaknesses. Given the unpredictability of the event and the strong competition, it's difficult to make a definitive prediction about who will finish ahead of whom.

However, I also consider the possibility that a minor incident or a misunderstanding could lead to a diplomatic response, which might not be immediately apparent. I also take into account the fact that the question resolves as 'yes' if there are official statements or credible reports of expulsions or recalls, which suggests that the question is looking for a relatively clear and public indication of a diplomatic response.

However, the exact timing and duration of these breaks can vary. Given that the question specifies a break can be any amount of time for Shonen Jump to state there will be one, it suggests a break is likely to be just a few days or a week, allowing the magazine to confirm the next chapter's release date.\n\nHowever, the manga's author, Tatsuki Fujimoto, has been known to take breaks between chapters or arcs for various reasons, including to allow himself time to plan the next storyline or to deal with personal issues. While the exact timing and duration of these breaks are unpredictable, they often coincide with significant plot developments or cliffhangers, which might suggest a break is more likely after a particularly intense or dramatic chapter.\n\nConsidering the typical release schedule of Shonen Jump and the author's known break patterns, I would estimate the probability of a break between chapters 173 and 174 as follows: Given that Shonen Jump usually releases chapters on a weekly basis and the author's history of taking breaks for planning or personal reasons, the probability of a break is moderate, but not extremely high."}, "prob": 0.65}, "prob": 0.65, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.5146, "brier_score": 0.4225, "brier_score_scaled": -69.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6587, "calibrated_prob": 0.4295, "brier_score": 0.1845, "brier_score_scaled": 26.2, "log_score": 0.8098}}

Looking at the ratings for Season 1, we can see a general trend of increasing ratings, with some fluctuations. The ratings for Season 2, however, show a more mixed trend, with some episodes receiving high ratings (e.g., E4: 9.6) and others receiving lower ratings (e.g., E3: 7.9). Given that the IMDB ratings for Season 2 have been lower than those for Season 1, it's possible that the ratings for S2E7 could be lower as well.

Considering the mixed trend for Season 2 and the possibility of S2E7 receiving a high rating, I would estimate the probability of S2E7 being rated >8.5 on IMDB two days after release as follows: The ratings for the previous episodes of Season 2 have been relatively low, with only one episode (E4) receiving a high rating. This suggests that the average rating for Season 2 might be lower than that of Season 1. However, the rating for S2E7 is not necessarily representative of the entire season, and it's possible that it could receive a high rating.

To answer this question, I need to consider the box office performance of these movies and the current trends in the film industry. 'Deadpool' (2016) was a massive commercial success, grossing over $363 million in the US and Canada, with an opening weekend of $132.4 million.

The combined opening weekend of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine' is $185.5 million. To determine the likelihood of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' surpassing this combined total, I need to consider the marketing campaign, the popularity of the characters, and the current box office trends. The marketing campaign for 'Deadpool & Wolverine' has been significant, with a large budget and a strong promotional push. The characters of Deadpool and Wolverine are both well-known and beloved by fans, which could lead to a strong opening weekend.

The popularity of Moana: Moana is a highly successful Disney franchise, and it's likely that Disney would want to capitalize on its popularity by creating a new Moana-themed ride. 3. The Magic Kingdom's need for new attractions: The Magic Kingdom is one of the most visited theme parks in the world, and it's likely that Disney would want to keep it fresh and exciting for visitors by introducing new rides. 4. The fact that betting closes on August 8, the day before the convention, suggests that Disney may have already made a decision about whether to announce a new Moana ride. However, there are also some counterarguments to consider: 1. Disney may choose to announce a new Moana ride at a different time, such as at the opening of the new park or at a separate event. 2. Disney may choose to announce a new Moana ride for a different theme park, such as Disney's Hollywood Studios or Epcot. 3. Disney may choose not to announce any new Moana rides at all.

However, the Olympics are a highly competitive event, and other teams, such as Australia, Spain, and Serbia, have also shown impressive performances in recent years. The men's and women's teams from these countries will likely be strong contenders for gold. Additionally, the Paris Olympics will feature a new format for the 5v5 basketball tournament, which could introduce some uncertainty and unpredictability. The format may favor teams that are well-adapted to the new rules and conditions. Considering these factors, I believe that while the United States has a good chance of winning gold in both men's and women's basketball, it's not a certainty. There are many variables that could influence the outcome, and other teams may be able to capitalize on the United States' weaknesses. Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of the United States winning gold in both men's and women's 5v5 basketball at the Paris Olympics as follows:"}, "prob": 0.35}, "prob": 0.35, "resolution": true, "log_score": 1.5146, "brier_score": 0.4225, "brier_score_scaled": -69.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6587, "calibrated_prob": 0.3337, "brier_score": 0.444, "brier_score_scaled": -77.6, "log_score": 1.5834}}

Firstly, the resolution of this question depends on whether Terunofuji misses any match during the tournament, which is a binary outcome. Given the complexity and variability of Sumo wrestling, injuries, and other factors can occur unexpectedly. However, I have no information about Terunofuji's current health status or any specific incidents that might affect his participation. Therefore, I will rely on general trends and statistics. Historically, Sumo wrestlers, including top-ranked ones like Terunofuji, often participate in all matches in a tournament unless they are severely injured or ill. However, it's not uncommon for wrestlers to withdraw from a match due to minor injuries or personal reasons. Given that the question only resolves to 'No' if Terunofuji misses any match, we are essentially looking for the probability of him not missing any matches. This implies that the probability of him participating in all matches is the complement of the probability of him missing at least one match. Since I don't have specific data on Terunofuji's past attendance rates or any current health concerns, I will lean on the general expectation that top-ranked wrestlers like Terunofuji have a high likelihood of participating in all matches, given their physical condition and the implications of missing a match on their ranking and reputation.

However, Biden's health has been a subject of public discussion, but he has been consistently working and has not shown any signs of significant decline. Moreover, his age and potential health risks are well-documented, and the public and the media closely monitor his health. While there is always a risk of unforeseen events, the likelihood of Biden's removal from office before the specified date seems low. The possibility of impeachment is also a consideration, but the Democratic Party's control of the House and the relatively low likelihood of a Republican-controlled Senate voting to convict him suggest that impeachment is unlikely.

Secondly, the Democratic Party has been actively supporting Biden's re-election bid, which further suggests that he is likely to continue his bid for the presidency. However, there are some potential factors that could lead to a change in his decision, such as health issues or a significant shift in his personal circumstances.

One factor that might be relevant is the director's previous work. Lee Isaac Chung, the director of 'Twisters', is known for his critically acclaimed film 'Minari' (2020), which won several awards, including four Academy Awards. This suggests that Chung has a track record of creating high-quality films that resonate with audiences and critics. On the other hand, the movie's cast, including Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar Jones, might not be as well-known for their dramatic work as they are for their action-oriented or television roles. This could potentially impact the movie's ability to attract a broad audience and generate positive word-of-mouth.

Firstly, the decision to rotate players heavily often depends on the specific circumstances of the match and the team's overall strategy. In this case, Uruguay might be looking to rest key players who are carrying injuries or have accumulated a high number of minutes in the tournament so far. They might also want to give younger or reserve players a chance to gain experience and potentially introduce fresh legs to the lineup. Additionally, the Copa America format and the importance of the match against the US could also play a role. If the match is a crucial one for Uruguay's chances of advancing or has significant implications for their standing in the group, they might be less inclined to make significant changes. However, if the match has little bearing on their position, they might opt for a more experimental lineup. Another factor to consider is the coach's style and history of player rotation. If the coach has a history of making significant changes, it's more likely that they will do so again. However, there is also the possibility that Uruguay might stick with a more consistent lineup, especially if they have a strong team dynamic and the players are performing well. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Uruguay rotating four or more starters as follows:"}, "prob": 0.7}, "prob": 0.7, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.737, "brier_score": 0.49, "brier_score_scaled": -96.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6587, "calibrated_prob": 0.4415, "brier_score": 0.195, "brier_score_scaled": 22.0, "log_score": 0.8405}}

Firstly, D23 is a major Disney fan convention where new and upcoming projects are often announced. This suggests that it is a plausible platform for Disney to reveal new information about the Peoplemover. Secondly, the description of the new Peoplemover version requires it to have portions with views above Tomorrowland, which suggests that it will be a ride that is visible and accessible to the public, rather than a hidden attraction. This increases the likelihood that it will be a new version of the existing Peoplemover rather than a completely new ride. Additionally, the characteristics that define a new version of the Peoplemover are quite specific, such as using existing track structure, rebuilding portions of the track, or having a station in the old peoplemover station building. While it is possible that Disney could announce a new ride that meets some of these criteria, it is less likely that they would announce a ride that meets all of them without making it a new version of the Peoplemover.
