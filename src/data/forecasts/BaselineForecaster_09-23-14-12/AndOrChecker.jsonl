This happens if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) invokes Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time). The duration of the incapacity does not matter for this question. Biden exiting the office of the Presidency by death, resignation, etc does not count. Biden invoking section 3 of the 25th amendment does not count.
