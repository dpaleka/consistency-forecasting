Local news, conspiracy websites, or comments by individual users on Manifold will not be sufficient.\n(2) Context from Politico:\n\nDozens of House Democrats are organizing a plan to speak out against their own party\u2019s effort to seal President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination sooner than originally planned, which they argue stifles the intense ongoing debate about his candidacy, according to a lawmaker involved in the effort.\n\nA drafted letter, circulated by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO, offers the first public signal from Democrats since the weekend\u2019s attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump that scores of their own members remain deeply unsettled about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really bad move by the DNC. Somebody thinks it\u2019s a clever way to lock down debate and I guess by dint of sheer force, achieve unity, but it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman said in an interview. He declined to confirm the existence of a letter.\n\nThis market resolves YES if a public letter opposing the early nomination plan is signed by at least 20 House Members or Senators who caucus with the Democratic Party before market close at the end of Sunday, July 21st. \n\nMultiple such letters with a combined total of 20 lawmaker's signatures would also be sufficient to resolve this market to YES. \n\nIf these criteria are not met by market close, this market resolves NO.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-03T14:02:15Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": null, "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.4, "metadata": {}}}}}

Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates its figures will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.\n\nThis market will resolve according to the datapoints for July 19 as soon as datapoints for July 20 become available. This market may not resolve until the July 20 datapoints are available. If no datapoints for July 19 are available by July 22, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous figures to July 19.\n\nPlease note the resolution refers to the odds of each candidate winning as a number out of 100 reported to the 1 digit mark (eg. \"Trump 57 times out of 100\"). The listed number of simulations out of 1,000 won by each candidate will NOT be considered.\n\n(b) This question will resolve Yes if a country other than Poland, Germany, USA, Sweden, England, or France is the winner of the WTC 2024 as announced on the official site or the official social media of the organisation.\n\n(c) Every month, a Manifold poll is being posted to gain the consensus view of progress towards AGI. Unlike many of the markets and questions on Manifold, these polls will simply ask \"has weak AGI been achieved,\" rather than providing a definition of the term. The goal is that given that the term is so broad, the only way to characterize AI progress is also to allow respondents to vote based upon their own understanding.\n\nProgress has been steady.  The previous polls are referenced here:\n\n@/SteveSokolowski/did-openai-achieve-weak-agi-with-gp  (Answer: 15)\n\n@/SteveSokolowski/june-2024-has-weak-agi-been-achieve  (Answer: 27)\n\nThe previous markets on this topic, which significantly understimated Manifold's belief in AI progress, were:\n\n@/SteveSokolowski/what-percentage-of-manifold-poll-re \n\n@/SteveSokolowski/will-at-least-20-of-manifold-respon \n\nThe polls will not reference any specific model, and will not define \"AGI\" except to state that the poll does not require that the software system be able to manipulate the physical world. The polls open on the 23rd of each month and close on the 30th.\n\nThis market will resolve to YES if the July 2024 poll results in a ratio of YES/(NO + YES) greater than or equal to 0.3. The \"no opinion\" respondents will be ignored. Otherwise, this question will resolve to NO.\n\nSee also:\n\n@/SteveSokolowski/will-one-of-the-monthly-has-weak-ag", "resolution_date": "2024-08-12T00:12:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": null, "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.4, "metadata": {}}}}}

This market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d if Donald Trump has a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Joe Biden according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for the day of July 19, 2024. If Biden and Trump have equal odds, this market will resolve 50-50. The resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's 2024 presidential election forecast, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/, specifically the numbers indicated by the blue and red trend lines for this market's resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates its figures will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. This market will resolve according to the datapoints for July 19 as soon as datapoints for July 20 become available. This market may not resolve until the July 20 datapoints are available. If no datapoints for July 19 are available by July 22, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous figures to July 19. Please note the resolution refers to the odds of each candidate winning as a number out of 100 reported to the 1 digit mark (eg. \"Trump 57 times out of 100\"). The listed number of simulations out of 1,000 won by each candidate will NOT be considered.\n\n(c) Resolves YES if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) invokes Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time).\n\nThe duration of the incapacity does not matter for this question.\n\nBiden exiting the office of the Presidency by death, resignation, etc does not count.
