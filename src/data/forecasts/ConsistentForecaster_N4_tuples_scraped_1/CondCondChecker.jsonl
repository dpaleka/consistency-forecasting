This means that before July 1, 2024, at least one of the following is true:\n- OpenAI does not publicly commit to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle via a statement from the company or a company spokesperson, such as Sam Altman. The statement may be formal (such as a press release) or informal (such as a tweet or quote in an interview). The statement from OpenAI does not indicate a new level of commitment to the principle in question, relative to the time the righttowarn.ai statement was published; it is a reiteration that, for example, \"we already have a culture of open criticism\".\n- Metaculus does not verify that the company has accepted the principle to the satisfaction of at least one member of righttowarn.ai. Metaculus may not reach out to select signatories or endorsers to assess their level of satisfaction with OpenAI's commitment.

These announcements must occur after the end of July 2024, or he has to formally resign and be out of office before the end of July. An announcement of his intention to do so is insufficient to resolve this market.\n\n(c) Iran does not initiate a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory between July 30 and August 12, 2024, 11:59 PM ET.
