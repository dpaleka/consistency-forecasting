Two of the most endangered Democrats told local news outlets they\u2019ve already written off Biden\u2019s chances to win in November.\n\nBehind the scenes, things are even more frenzied. There are multiple drafts of letters circulating among House Democrats and at least one would call on Biden to end his campaign, according to five people familiar with the efforts.\n\nThis market resolves YES if 5 or more named Democratic Party US House Members/US Senators work together to ask Joe Biden to consider ending his 2024 re-election campaign, or if such a group urges him to do so, before Saturday July 20th (Pacific Time).\n\nThis could be by having a signed letter like what is reported above, or by having a group speaking with Biden in person and collectively asking him to drop out.\n\nThis market requires that 5 or more individuals be part of the same group message. Five people separately telling reporters they think Biden should drop out is not sufficient for a YES resolution.\n\nReports of any number of unnamed democrats writing to Biden and asking him to step aside will not satisfy this market's criteria unless 5 or more qualifying names are later made public before this market's end date. In any ambiguous cases where such names are reported but not confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt, this market will err towards resolving NO.\n\nIf these criteria are met before July 20th, this market resolves NO.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-23 22:24:44+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-05 18:47:55+00:00", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.3, "elicitation_metadata": null}}}]}}}}
