A drafted letter, circulated by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO, offers the first public signal from Democrats since the weekend\u2019s attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump that scores of their own members remain deeply unsettled about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad move by the DNC. Somebody thinks it\u2019s a clever way to lock down debate and I guess by dint of sheer force, achieve unity, but it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman said in an interview.
