However, they're not catastrophically low to the point where the party would force him out. 5.

It's extremely rare for a sitting president to decline their party's nomination for a second term, especially this late in the election cycle. Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. While there have been concerns about his age and approval ratings, there's no strong indication that he plans to step aside.

Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in multiple states to remove Trump from the ballot using the 14th Amendment.

This suggests a low probability of either event occurring. 3. Political stability: As of now, there are no major political crises or scandals that would likely lead to Biden's resignation. 4. Time frame: The question only asks about a period of approximately one month (from the creation date to the end of July 2024). This short timeframe reduces the likelihood of unexpected events occurring. 5. 2024 Election: While the 2024 presidential election will be approaching, it won't take place until November, well after the period in question. 6. 25th Amendment clause: The question specifically states that temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment does not count as ceasing to be President, which eliminates one potential way Biden might briefly not be serving as President. 7. Biden's commitment: Biden has shown no indications of wanting to step down from the presidency and has expressed interest in running for re-election in 2024. Given these factors, the probability of Biden remaining President through the end of July 2024 is quite high.

Likelihood of sudden death: For any individual, especially at an advanced age, there's always a possibility of sudden death due to various factors like heart attack, stroke, or accident. However, as the President, Biden receives excellent medical care and constant monitoring, which reduces this risk. 3. Time frame: The question specifies a very short time frame - from July 5, 2024 (creation date) to July 26, 2024 (market close on Friday). This is only about three weeks, which is an extremely short period for such a significant event to occur. 4.

In the event of a President's death, the Vice President immediately assumes the role of President as per the U.S. Constitution. 5.

Legal precedent: There have been attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates in the past, but they have rarely been successful. However, the events of January 6, 2021, and Trump's alleged role in them have created a unique situation. 2. State-level actions: Some states have already attempted to remove Trump from their ballots. For example, in 2023, Colorado's Supreme Court ruled to remove Trump from the state's primary ballot, citing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This decision was later stayed pending a U.S. Supreme Court review. 3. Supreme Court involvement: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the Colorado case, with a decision expected in early 2024. This ruling will likely set a precedent for other states considering similar actions. 4. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is after the primary season for most states. This gives ample time for legal challenges and appeals to play out. 5. Political climate: The issue is highly politicized, which could influence decision-making at various levels. 6. Multiple states: The question only requires one state to remove or block Trump from the ballot for a 'Yes' resolution. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that at least one state will have removed or blocked Trump from their primary ballot by July 15, 2024. The Colorado case, in particular, provides a strong precedent if upheld by the Supreme Court. Even if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado, other states might find alternative legal grounds to attempt removal. However, there are also strong counterarguments. The Supreme Court may rule in Trump's favor, setting a precedent that makes it difficult for other states to remove him from the ballot. Additionally, political pressures and concerns about voter disenfranchisement could discourage states from taking such actions. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability that Trump will be removed or blocked from at least one state's primary ballot by the resolution date."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d012f2a8-12c5-46a2-b0d9-59d9da61dff8", "title": "Will Ted Cruz be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Ted Cruz is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Name recognition: While Elder has some national recognition due to his radio show and his run for California governor in 2021, he doesn't have the same level of national prominence as other potential candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley. Political experience: Elder has never held elected office, which could be seen as a disadvantage compared to other potential candidates with gubernatorial or congressional experience. Fundraising ability: Successful presidential campaigns require significant financial resources. It's unclear if Elder has the fundraising network to compete with more established politicians. Party support: There's no indication that Elder has substantial support from the Republican Party establishment or major donors. Competition: The Republican field is likely to be crowded with well-known figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others who have more national recognition and support. Timing: As of now, Elder has not made any clear moves towards running for president in 2024, which puts him behind other potential candidates who are already positioning themselves.

Party rules: The Republican National Convention's rules and procedures are designed to select a single presidential nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses, followed by delegate voting at the convention. 3. Current political landscape: As of now, Donald Trump is a prominent figure in the Republican Party and has announced his candidacy for the 2024 election. Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, has also announced his candidacy but is considered a long-shot candidate with much less national recognition than Trump. 4. Likelihood of rule changes: For both Trump and Suarez to be nominees, the Republican Party would need to make unprecedented changes to its nomination process. Such a drastic change is extremely unlikely, especially given the party's traditional stance and the lack of any indication that they are considering such a move. 5. Legal and logistical challenges: Having two presidential nominees would create significant complications for ballot access, campaign finance regulations, and the general election process. These challenges make such a scenario highly improbable. 6.

They have significantly higher polling numbers and more media attention than Christie. 2. Christie's political position: Christie has been critical of Trump, which may alienate a significant portion of the Republican base that still strongly supports the former president. This stance could make it difficult for him to gain widespread support within the party. 3. Past performance: Christie ran for the Republican nomination in 2016 but dropped out early after poor performances in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. This history may affect voters' and party officials' perceptions of his viability as a candidate. 4. Name recognition: While Christie has national name recognition from his time as New Jersey governor and his 2016 run, he has been less prominent in national politics recently compared to other potential candidates. 5. Fundraising ability: Christie would need to demonstrate strong fundraising capabilities to compete with well-funded candidates like Trump and DeSantis. It's unclear if he has the necessary financial backing at this point. 6. Party dynamics: The Republican Party has shifted significantly since Christie's last run, with a stronger emphasis on populist and conservative policies. Christie's more moderate reputation may not align well with the current party base. 7.

Declared candidacy: As of now, Christie has not officially declared his candidacy for the 2024 election, although he has hinted at a potential run. This puts him at a disadvantage compared to already declared candidates who are actively campaigning and fundraising.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Current intentions: As of now (July 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024.

Latvia's recent poor performance is particularly concerning, while Belgium has a slightly better track record but is not a guaranteed qualifier. The probability of both qualifying is lower than either one qualifying individually. If we assume Belgium has a moderate chance of qualifying (around 50%) and Latvia has a lower chance (around 30%), the probability of both qualifying would be the product of their individual probabilities. However, considering the uncertainties and the potential for surprises in Eurovision, I'll adjust the estimate slightly upward. Probability: 0.18 suggests that while it's possible for both Latvia and Belgium to qualify, it's relatively unlikely, with only about an 18% chance of occurring."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Taking Chasiv Yar would allow Russia to push further into Donetsk Oblast. 3. Time frame: The question asks about the situation approximately 13 months from now, which is a significant amount of time in terms of military operations. 4. Recent Russian tactics: Russia has been focusing on attritional warfare and slow, grinding advances rather than rapid offensives. 5. Ukrainian defenses: Ukraine has been fortifying positions in the area and has shown resilience in defending key locations. 6. International support: Continued Western support for Ukraine could impact their ability to hold the line, but the level of future support is uncertain. 7. Russian resources: Russia has shown the ability to sustain long-term military operations, but their resources are not unlimited. 8.

The timeframe (before July 20) is also quite short, leaving little time for such a dramatic shift in party dynamics. (b) Another Democratic party presidential debate: This also seems unlikely. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has already expressed support for Biden's re-election bid and typically, incumbent presidents do not participate in primary debates.

Ireland's recent struggle to qualify indicates they may face challenges in 2024 as well. 3. Song and performer selection: The quality of the song and the performer's ability are crucial factors. As of now, we don't know who will represent Ireland or what song they will perform in 2024. This uncertainty makes it difficult to assess their chances accurately. 4. Voting patterns: Eurovision voting often involves regional and cultural voting blocs. Ireland doesn't benefit from strong regional voting blocs like some other countries do, which can make qualification more challenging. 5. Changes in format or rules: Any potential changes to the Eurovision format or voting system for 2024 could impact Ireland's chances, but we don't have information about such changes at this time. 6. Motivation to improve: Given Ireland's recent poor performance, there may be increased pressure and motivation to select a stronger entry for 2024. This could potentially improve their chances. 7. Unpredictability of the contest: Eurovision results can be unpredictable, with surprises happening each year. A particularly strong or unique entry could boost Ireland's chances significantly. Considering these factors, especially Ireland's recent struggle to qualify and the inherent unpredictability of the contest, I would estimate that Ireland has a below-average but not negligible chance of qualifying for the Grand Final in 2024. Their historical success and potential motivation to improve prevent me from estimating an extremely low probability."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "64e9494d-1605-4fd9-978b-b4a2aaee82e3", "title": "Will Luxembourg qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Luxembourg participates in a Semi-final and is then officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Luxembourg's participation: Luxembourg has not participated in Eurovision since 1993. There have been no official announcements about their return as of now. 2. Historical performance: When Luxembourg was active in Eurovision (1956-1993), they had a strong track record, winning 5 times and finishing in the top 5 on 15 occasions. 3. Current music scene: Luxembourg has a small but diverse music scene. However, without recent participation, it's unclear how competitive they would be in the modern Eurovision landscape. 4. Qualification process: If Luxembourg were to participate, they would likely need to go through a semi-final round. The qualification rate from semi-finals is typically around 50% (10 out of 20 countries usually qualify). 5. Time frame: The question was created in April 2024, which is very close to the actual event. If Luxembourg were planning to participate, it would likely have been announced well before this date. 6. EBU membership: Luxembourg's broadcaster RTL is still a member of the EBU, which means they are eligible to participate if they choose to do so. Given these factors, the probability of Luxembourg qualifying for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024 is very low. The main reason for this is that there's no indication of Luxembourg planning to return to the contest. Even if they did decide to participate at the last minute, they would face challenges in preparing a competitive entry in such a short time frame. If Luxembourg were to participate, their historical success might give them a slight edge, but the modern Eurovision is very different from when they last competed. The qualification rate from semi-finals would put their chances at around 50% if they did compete, but the likelihood of participation itself is extremely low.

Historical performance: - Ireland has a strong Eurovision history, having won the contest 7 times. However, their recent performance has been less impressive, failing to qualify for the final in 6 of the last 7 contests. - Luxembourg hasn't participated in Eurovision since 1993, which means they lack recent experience and may face challenges in terms of preparation and voter familiarity. 2. Current music industry standing: - Ireland has maintained a presence in the international music scene, which could potentially translate to a stronger Eurovision entry. - Luxembourg's music industry is relatively small, which might limit their pool of potential artists and songwriters. 3. Semi-final allocation: - The semi-final allocation can significantly impact a country's chances of qualifying. However, this information is not available at the time of this assessment. 4. Voting patterns: - Ireland might benefit from diaspora voting and cultural ties with other English-speaking countries. - Luxembourg, being a small country, may struggle to secure enough votes unless they present an exceptionally strong entry. 5. Renewed focus: - Ireland has been trying to improve its Eurovision performance in recent years, which could lead to a stronger entry. - Luxembourg's return to the contest after a long absence might generate interest and potentially lead to a well-prepared entry. 6. Qualification rate: - Typically, about 50% of countries in each semi-final qualify for the final. This means each country has roughly a 50% chance of qualifying, all else being equal. Given these factors, Ireland has a slightly better chance of qualifying than Luxembourg due to their recent participation and established presence in the contest. However, Luxembourg's return might create buzz and lead to a strong entry. Considering that both countries need to qualify for this question to resolve as Yes, and assuming each has around a 50% chance (with Ireland slightly higher and Luxembourg slightly lower), the probability of both qualifying is significantly lower than either one qualifying alone. Probability: 0.3 This probability reflects the challenging nature of both countries needing to qualify, especially given Ireland's recent struggles and Luxembourg's long absence from the contest.

Biden is the incumbent, which typically favors running for re-election. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There have been ongoing concerns about his age and mental acuity, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current statements and actions: As of now (early 2024), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has taken steps consistent with a re-election campaign, including fundraising and building campaign infrastructure. 4. Democratic Party support: Despite some concerns about his age, the Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden, and there is no strong alternative candidate emerging to challenge him for the nomination. 5. Political landscape: The Republican field is still taking shape, and Biden may see himself as the strongest candidate to defeat potential Republican nominees, particularly if former President Trump is the GOP nominee. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely that Biden would wait until so late in the process to announce he's not running, as it would leave the party scrambling to find an alternative nominee. 7.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden will announce he's not accepting the nomination before July 15, 2024.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden has consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. It's highly unusual for an incumbent president to drop out of the race, especially this late in the election cycle. The deadline given (July 15, 2024) is very close to the Democratic National Convention, which is typically held in August. For Biden to announce he won't accept the nomination at such a late stage would be unprecedented and highly disruptive to the Democratic Party. While not impossible, this scenario is very unlikely.

While special elections can sometimes produce surprising results, especially if there are unique circumstances or a particularly strong Democratic candidate, the historical voting patterns of this district suggest that a Republican victory is quite likely.

While he has gained some attention for his views and background as a successful entrepreneur, he faces significant challenges: - He lacks political experience compared to other candidates. - He is not as well-known as established Republican figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Mike Pence. - Current polls show him with very low support among Republican voters. - The Republican establishment is more likely to back a more experienced candidate. Given these factors, the probability of Ramaswamy becoming the nominee is very low, likely less than 1%. 2. Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024: This is more likely to occur: - Trump is already under investigation in Georgia for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. - There is evidence of Trump's communications with election officials and others that could be construed as attempts to influence witnesses. - The Fulton County District Attorney has been actively pursuing the case. - Legal experts have suggested that charges are likely.

Timeline: The question asks about an announcement before July 5, 2024, which is about 14 months from the creation date of this question. This is a relatively short timeframe in terms of trade policy decisions, but it's long enough for the EU to complete its investigation and make a decision. 3. EU's protectionist tendencies: The EU has shown a willingness to protect its domestic industries, especially in strategic sectors like automotive manufacturing. The rise of Chinese EV manufacturers poses a significant threat to European automakers. 4. Political pressure: European automakers and labor unions are likely to lobby for protective measures against Chinese EVs, which could influence the EU's decision-making process. 5. China's response: The threat of retaliatory measures from China might make the EU hesitant to impose new tariffs or duties. However, given the EU's recent more assertive stance towards China, this may not be a significant deterrent. 6. Global trade environment: The ongoing trend towards protectionism and reshoring of supply chains could make new tariffs more likely. 7.

Let's break down the key factors: 1. Legal precedent: There have been attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates, but it has rarely been successfully applied in modern times. The most notable recent case was the removal of Couy Griffin from a county commissioner position in New Mexico in 2022. 2. Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in multiple states to remove Trump from the ballot using this argument. Colorado and Maine have already made decisions to remove Trump from their primary ballots, citing the 14th Amendment. 3. Supreme Court involvement: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the Colorado case, with arguments scheduled for February 8, 2024. Their decision will likely set a precedent for other states. 4. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which gives ample time for legal processes to unfold, including potential Supreme Court rulings. 5. Political climate: The issue is highly contentious and politically charged, which could influence decision-making processes in various states. 6. State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently, potentially leading to varied outcomes across the country. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that at least one state will have removed or blocked Trump from their primary ballot by July 15, 2024. The Colorado and Maine decisions, although currently under appeal, demonstrate that there is a willingness among some state officials to take this action. Even if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado's decision, other states might find alternative legal grounds or interpretations to justify ballot removal. However, the involvement of the Supreme Court adds uncertainty. If they rule decisively against using the 14th Amendment in this way, it could effectively prevent other states from taking similar actions. But given the complexity of the issue, they might leave some room for state-level discretion.

(a) Biden remaining President through end of July 2024: Joe Biden is currently the President of the United States and has not shown any signs of intending to resign. While his age (80 years old) is a factor to consider, he appears to be in relatively good health for his age. The probability of a sitting president not completing their term due to death or resignation is historically low. Since 1900, only 4 out of 20 presidents have not completed their terms (McKinley, Harding, Roosevelt, and Kennedy). This gives us a rough historical probability of about 20% for a president not completing their term. However, given Biden's age, we might adjust this probability slightly higher. Let's estimate the probability of Biden remaining President through July 2024 at around 85%. (b) Donald Trump being removed or blocked from a primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This is a more complex and unprecedented situation. The 14th Amendment, Section 3 has rarely been invoked, and never for a presidential candidate of Trump's stature. However, there are ongoing efforts and discussions about using this amendment to prevent Trump from running. Several factors to consider: 1. Legal challenges have already been initiated in some states. 2. The issue is highly contentious and likely to face significant legal battles. 3. Different states may interpret and apply the amendment differently. 4. The Supreme Court may ultimately need to weigh in on this issue. Given the unprecedented nature of this situation and the legal complexities involved, it's difficult to assign a high probability to this occurring. However, given the multiple states where this could potentially happen and the ongoing efforts, there's a non-trivial chance it could occur in at least one state. Let's estimate the probability of this happening at around 30%. For both (a) and (b) to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.85 * 0.30 = 0.255 or 25.5%.

There have been ongoing discussions about his age and fitness for office, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current political climate: As of July 2024, Biden's approval ratings and the overall political landscape will play a crucial role in his decision. If his popularity is low or if there are significant challenges facing the country, it might influence his choice. 4. Party support: The Democratic Party's stance and potential alternative candidates will be important factors. If there's strong support for Biden within the party, it's less likely he would step aside. 5. Personal factors: Biden's own desires, family considerations, and legacy concerns will influence his decision. 6. Timing: The question specifies a deadline of July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August).

Previous statements: Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election, including filing for re-election with the Federal Election Commission in April 2023. Considering these factors, it seems unlikely that Biden would announce he won't accept the nomination this close to the convention, especially given his previous statements and actions indicating his intention to run.

Given these factors, Greece has a higher individual chance of qualifying based on their historical performance. Lithuania's chances are more moderate, but they have shown improvement in recent years. For both countries to qualify, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. If we estimate Greece's chances at around 80% and Lithuania's at 65% (giving them credit for recent improvement), the combined probability would be 0.80 * 0.65 = 0.52.

Biden is the incumbent, which typically favors running for re-election. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history.

Constitutional process: For Harris to become President or Acting President, one of the following would need to occur: a) Biden resigns b) Biden is removed from office through impeachment c) Biden becomes incapacitated and invokes the 25th Amendment d) Biden dies in office 3. Time frame: The question spans from the creation date (May 9, 2020) to July 26, 2024, which covers most of Biden's first term and potentially part of a second term if he's re-elected. 4. Historical precedent: In U.S. history, only nine vice presidents have ascended to the presidency due to the death or resignation of the president. This is relatively rare. 5. Biden's age and health: Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history, which does increase the risk of health issues. However, he has regular check-ups and appears to be in relatively good health for his age. 6. Political stability: There are no current serious attempts at impeachment or signs of major health concerns that would trigger the 25th Amendment. 7. Election cycle: The 2024 election will occur within this timeframe, which could potentially lead to a change in administration, but that would be after the resolution date. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Harris to become President or Acting President by the specified date, it seems unlikely. The most probable scenario would be due to unforeseen health issues with President Biden, given his advanced age.

This division could either strengthen Trump's position or weaken the family's overall chances. 4.

This is the closest comparison we have, as Russia is likely to be the main source of INAs in 2024. 2. Current geopolitical situation: Due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, it's likely that Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete as INAs in Paris 2024, similar to how they competed in the 2022 Winter Olympics. 3.

(a) Men's 100m dash Olympic record: The current Olympic record for the men's 100m dash is 9.63 seconds, set by Usain Bolt in 2012. Breaking this record would require an exceptional performance. While world-class sprinters continue to push the boundaries, breaking this record is a significant challenge. The current world record (9.58s by Bolt) has stood since 2009, indicating the difficulty of improving upon these times. However, advancements in training, technology, and the emergence of new talent could potentially lead to a new record. I'd estimate the probability of breaking the Olympic record at around 0.3. (b) Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals: This part is more complex due to the political nature of Individual Neutral Athletes (INA) participation. INAs are typically athletes from countries facing international sanctions or other issues preventing them from competing under their national flag. The number of INAs and their competitive level can vary significantly. In recent Olympics, the number of gold medals won by such athletes has been relatively low. For example, at Tokyo 2020, the Russian Olympic Committee (competing under a neutral flag) won 20 gold medals, but they were not technically INAs. True INAs are usually fewer in number and win fewer medals. Given the uncertainty and typically lower numbers, I'd estimate the probability of INAs winning 15 or more gold medals at around 0.1.

(a) A swimmer wins the most gold medals: Swimming has historically been one of the sports where athletes can win multiple medals in a single Olympics. Swimmers like Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz, and more recently, Caeleb Dressel have dominated medal counts in past Olympics. However, other sports like athletics (track and field) and gymnastics also offer multiple medal opportunities. For the 2024 Paris Olympics, swimming remains a strong contender for producing the athlete with the most gold medals. Swimmers like Caeleb Dressel (USA) and Emma McKeon (Australia) are likely to compete for multiple medals. However, we should also consider potential breakout stars in other sports. I'd estimate the probability of a swimmer winning the most gold medals at around 60-65%. (b) The same nation wins more than one women's team sport: There are eight women's team sports in the Olympics. For this part to be true, one nation needs to win at least two of these. Historically, certain nations have shown dominance in multiple team sports. For example: - The United States is strong in basketball (both 3x3 and 5x5), volleyball, and water polo. - The Netherlands is competitive in field hockey and football. - Australia performs well in rugby sevens and basketball. Given the number of sports and the historical performance of some nations across multiple team sports, it seems more likely than not that at least one nation will win more than one women's team sport. I'd estimate the probability of the same nation winning more than one women's team sport at around 70-75%. For the overall question to be true, both (a) and (b) need to occur.

Incumbency advantage: Historically, sitting presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless facing significant health issues or extremely low approval ratings. Biden is the incumbent, which typically favors running for re-election. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There have been ongoing discussions about his age and fitness for office, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current political climate: As of July 2024, Biden's approval ratings and the overall political landscape will play a crucial role in his decision. If his approval ratings are very low or if there's a strong push within the Democratic Party for a new candidate, it could increase the chances of him stepping aside. 4. Biden's previous statements: So far, Biden has consistently indicated his intention to run for re-election. In April 2022, he stated that he would be \"very fortunate\" to run against Donald Trump again in 2024. 5. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely for an incumbent president to wait this long to announce they're not seeking re-election, as it would leave little time for other candidates to campaign effectively. 6. Party unity: The Democratic Party is likely to prefer avoiding a last-minute change in candidacy, as it could lead to disarray and weaken their position in the general election. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he's not accepting the nomination so close to the convention date.

(a) Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal: Sha'Carri Richardson is a talented American sprinter known for her exceptional speed. She has shown great potential in the 100m event, having run the sixth-fastest time ever by an American woman. However, winning an Olympic gold medal is extremely challenging due to fierce competition from other world-class athletes. Additionally, Richardson faced a suspension in 2021 that prevented her from competing in the Tokyo Olympics, which may have affected her training and competitive experience. She will have opportunities in the 100m and potentially the 4x100m relay. While she has a good chance of medaling, winning gold is not guaranteed. I would estimate her chances of winning a gold medal at around 40%. (b) France placing in the Top 5: France has historically performed well in the Olympics, but not consistently in the top 5. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, France finished 8th in the medal table. However, being the host country for the 2024 Games could provide several advantages: 1. Home crowd support 2. Familiarity with venues and conditions 3. Potentially more athletes qualifying due to host nation spots 4. Increased funding and preparation leading up to the Games.

This means Nvidia would need to nearly triple its market cap while Apple remains stagnant, or some combination of Nvidia growing and Apple shrinking. 2. Growth trends: Nvidia has been experiencing rapid growth due to the AI boom and its dominance in GPU technology. Its stock price has more than doubled in 2023 alone. Apple, while still growing, has been doing so at a slower pace. 3. Industry dynamics: Nvidia is at the forefront of the AI revolution, which is expected to continue growing. Apple, while a tech giant, is more focused on consumer electronics and services, which may not have the same explosive growth potential in the near term. 4. Time frame: The question asks about July 17, 2024, which is about a year from now. This is a relatively short time for such a significant market cap shift, but not impossible given recent tech market volatility. 5. Economic factors: Any major economic shifts or tech industry regulations could impact both companies differently. 6. Innovation and product launches: Both companies could release groundbreaking products or face setbacks that significantly affect their valuations. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Nvidia to overtake Apple in market cap by July 2024, it would require an extraordinary and unprecedented growth rate for Nvidia and/or a significant decline for Apple. The gap between their current market caps is substantial, and Apple has consistently maintained its position as one of the world's most valuable companies. However, the AI boom and Nvidia's central role in it do provide a pathway for significant growth. If the AI trend accelerates even faster than current expectations and Nvidia maintains its dominant position, while Apple faces challenges or market saturation, the scenario becomes more plausible. Probability: 0.15 I assign a 15% probability to this outcome. While it's a low probability event, the potential for rapid change in the tech sector and Nvidia's current momentum make it non-negligible.

Quality of entries: Australia has consistently sent high-quality entries to Eurovision, often featuring established artists or winners from their national selection show. 4. Voting patterns: Australia tends to receive support from both jury and televoting, which increases their chances of qualification. 5. Semi-final allocation: The difficulty of qualifying can depend on which semi-final Australia is placed in, but this information is not available yet for 2024. 6. Competition level: The overall quality of entries from other countries can affect Australia's chances, but this is unknown at this point for 2024. 7. Rule changes: There have been no announced changes to the qualification process that would significantly impact Australia's chances. 8. Continued participation: As of now, there's no indication that Australia won't participate in Eurovision 2024. Given Australia's strong track record, consistent quality of entries, and recent qualification success, the chances of them qualifying for the Grand Final in 2024 are quite high. However, Eurovision results can be unpredictable, and factors like the quality of their 2024 entry and the strength of competition are unknown at this time.

(a) Another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention: As of now, Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for 2024. Typically, when an incumbent president is running for re-election, the party doesn't hold primary debates. However, there have been some calls for debates due to concerns about Biden's age and fitness for office. Despite this, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has not scheduled any debates, and Biden's campaign has not expressed interest in participating in one. The likelihood of a debate occurring is low, but not impossible. Probability for (a): Approximately 0.15 or 15%. (b) Kamala Harris formally designated as President or Acting President before July 26, 2024: For this to happen, President Biden would need to either resign, be removed from office, or become incapacitated.

Recent events, such as Iran's support for Hamas and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, have further escalated tensions. 2.

This risk might serve as a deterrent for Israel. 5.

Iran's recent actions: Iran's drone and missile attack on Israel on April 13, 2024, in response to an earlier Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in Syria, has significantly heightened tensions between the two countries. 7.

Recent performance: The Netherlands finished 15th in the 2023 final, showing they can still compete at a high level. Croatia finished 13th in the 2023 final, their best result since 2016, indicating an upward trend. 3. Eurovision voting patterns: The Netherlands often receives support from neighboring countries and has a history of sending high-quality entries. Croatia has been improving its strategy and song selection in recent years, which has led to better results. 4. Qualification system: 10 countries qualify from each semi-final, out of approximately 15-18 participants per semi-final. This means that roughly 55-66% of countries in each semi-final qualify. 5. Uncertainty factors: Song quality and performance on the night play a significant role. The draw for semi-final allocation can impact chances (e.g., being in a stronger semi-final could reduce chances). Changes in voting systems or juries could affect outcomes. Given these factors, the Netherlands has a high chance of qualifying, probably around 80-85%. Croatia's chances are lower but still good, probably around 60-65%. For both to qualify, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.825 (Netherlands) * 0.625 (Croatia) \u2248 0.516. This calculation suggests that there's a slightly better than 50% chance that both countries will qualify.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2.

(a) Biden dropping out before July 20, 2024: Currently, President Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. Barring any severe health issues or unforeseen circumstances, it's unlikely that he would drop out. The probability of this happening is low, perhaps around 10-15%. (b) Trump being removed or blocked from any state's primary ballot under the 14th Amendment: This is a more complex issue. There have been discussions and some legal attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running for office due to his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot. However, as of now, no state has successfully removed him from the ballot on these grounds. While there are ongoing efforts, it's uncertain whether any will succeed by July 15, 2024. The probability of this occurring in at least one state is moderate, perhaps around 30-40%. For both conditions to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities. Even if we take the higher estimates for each (15% for Biden dropping out and 40% for Trump being removed from a ballot), the joint probability would be 0.15 * 0.40 = 0.06 or 6%. However, these events are not entirely independent. If Trump were to be removed from ballots, it might slightly decrease the pressure on Biden to step aside, as Democrats might see Trump as a weaker opponent. Conversely, if Biden were to drop out, it might intensify efforts to remove Trump from ballots. These factors might slightly increase the joint probability. Taking all of this into account, I would estimate the probability of both events occurring to be slightly higher than the simple multiplication would suggest, but still quite low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0037530696100279565, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0012510232033426522, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.08585457105482136, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, Georgia's recent performances have been consistently poor, while Estonia's have been mixed.

While it's possible for information to leak this quickly, it's not guaranteed, especially for such a momentous decision. 5. Reliability of sources: The question specifies that the report must come from a reliable major outlet. These organizations typically require strong confirmation before reporting such significant news, which could delay reporting. 6.

(a) Joe Biden dropping out and media coverage: The likelihood of Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 presidential race is relatively low.

Competition: There are already several high-profile candidates in the race, including former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, and others. These candidates have much higher name recognition and established support bases. 3. Polling: In current national polls for the Republican primary, Suarez is not even registering enough support to be included in most surveys. This indicates a very low level of support and recognition among Republican voters. 4. Fundraising: As a relatively unknown candidate, Suarez would likely struggle to raise the necessary funds to compete in a national campaign against well-funded opponents. 5. Experience: While Suarez has executive experience as a mayor, he lacks national political experience, which could be seen as a disadvantage by many Republican voters and party leaders. 6. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still more than a year away, which theoretically gives Suarez time to build a campaign and gain support. However, given the strength of the current field, this seems highly unlikely. 7. Historical precedent: It is extremely rare for a candidate with such low national profile to surge to become a major party nominee, especially in a field with established national figures. Given these factors, the probability of Francis Suarez becoming the Republican nominee is extremely low. While not impossible, it would require an extraordinary and unprecedented series of events for him to overcome the current frontrunners and secure the nomination."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "2a61298c-621f-45a8-bad7-6be8f54d82bb", "title": "Will 538 Project Biden as the favorite on Friday?", "body": "This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if Joe Biden has a higher probability of winning the US presidential election than Donald Trump according to the FiveThirtyEight election forecast for the day of July 19, 2024.

Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee: Francis Suarez is currently the Mayor of Miami and has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, he is considered a long-shot candidate for several reasons: - He has low national name recognition compared to other candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley. - He lacks experience in national politics. - He is not currently polling well in early primary states. - The Republican field is already crowded with more established candidates. Given these factors, the probability of Suarez winning the nomination is extremely low, likely less than 1%. 2. 538 projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This condition is more plausible. Biden is the incumbent president and currently the presumptive Democratic nominee. However, several factors make this uncertain: - Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low. - Economic conditions and other national issues could change significantly by 2024. - The Republican nominee (whoever it may be) could gain momentum. - Third-party candidates could affect the race. Given these factors, and assuming a somewhat competitive race, the probability of 538 projecting Biden as the favorite on that specific date might be around 50-60%. To resolve YES, both conditions must be met. Since the probability of the first condition is extremely low, the overall probability of both occurring is also extremely low.

Inflation: Ticket prices in 2024 will likely be higher than in 2013 and 2016, making it easier to achieve higher dollar amounts. 8. Marketing: Given the high-profile nature of this film, it's likely to have a massive marketing campaign, increasing awareness and hype. 9. Release date: The film is set for release on July 26, 2024, which is typically a strong period for summer blockbusters. 10.

However, there has been no official announcement or strong rumors about her involvement in this movie.

I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 30%. 2. Box office opening higher than Deadpool and The Wolverine combined: The target to beat is $185,548,391. Several factors support a high opening: - Deadpool and Wolverine are both very popular characters with established fan bases. - This movie brings them together for the first time, which should generate significant buzz. - The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) connection could attract a broader audience. - Inflation since the release of the previous movies will naturally push the numbers higher. - The movie industry has been seeing a resurgence post-pandemic, with several recent blockbusters performing well. However, there are also some potential challenges: - The R-rating might limit the audience somewhat. - Competition from other summer blockbusters could affect the opening weekend. - There's always a risk of superhero movie fatigue among general audiences.

Growth potential: Nvidia has been experiencing rapid growth due to the AI boom and its dominance in the GPU market. It has shown impressive year-over-year growth rates.

Apple, while a mature company, still has growth potential in services and potentially new product categories (e.g., AR/VR headsets). 3.

State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently, increasing the chances that at least one state might remove Trump from the ballot. 6.

Time between Olympics: The standard four-year gap between Olympics (in this case, three years due to the Tokyo Olympics delay) allows for significant improvements in many sports. However, we should also consider some counterpoints: 1. Existing records: As world records are broken, they become increasingly difficult to surpass. Some long-standing records may be particularly challenging to break. 2. Anti-doping measures: Stricter anti-doping policies may make it more difficult for athletes to artificially enhance their performances. 3. Potential external factors: Unforeseen circumstances like weather conditions or global events could impact performances.

Incumbency advantage: Historically, sitting presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless faced with significant challenges or health issues. Biden is the incumbent, which typically favors running for re-election. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There have been ongoing concerns about his age and mental acuity, which could potentially lead to a decision not to run. 3. Current statements and actions: As of now (July 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has already launched his 2024 campaign. This strongly indicates he plans to accept the nomination. 4. Democratic Party support: Despite some concerns about his age, the Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden's re-election bid. There is no strong push from within the party for him to step aside. 5. Political landscape: The Republican field is still taking shape, and Biden may see himself as the Democrats' best chance to retain the White House, especially given his previous victory over Donald Trump. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely that Biden would wait until so late in the process to make such a significant announcement if he did intend to step aside. 7.

Historical context: Verisign has been managing the .com TLD since 2000, and their agreement with the US government has been renewed multiple times.

Any change in its management would require careful consideration and planning to ensure continued stability and security of the domain name system. 3. Time frame: The question asks about a change before August 3, 2024, which is less than four months before the current agreement is set to expire. This is a relatively short time frame for such a significant change. 4. Lack of public discussion or announcements: As of the question's creation date (July 2, 2024), there have been no significant public discussions or announcements from the US government or other relevant parties about ending the agreement with Verisign prematurely. 5. Regulatory and legal processes: Terminating such an important agreement would likely involve complex regulatory and legal processes, which typically take considerable time. 6. Verisign's performance: There have been no major issues or controversies reported regarding Verisign's management of the .com TLD that would prompt an early termination of the agreement. 7. Alternative management options: If the US government were to end the agreement with Verisign, they would need to have a viable alternative in place. Developing and implementing such an alternative would likely take more time than the period specified in the question. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the US government would abruptly end its agreement with Verisign before August 3, 2024.

While this falls within the specified range, polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time, especially in the lead-up to an election. The timeframe between July 5 and July 15 is relatively short, which suggests that drastic changes are less likely, but still possible. Given the current lead and the narrow range specified, I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 30-40%. (b) The linked market getting at least 377 traders by the end of July 15: This part is more challenging to predict without additional context about the current number of traders or the typical growth rate of traders in similar markets. However, given that this is described as involving 'market shenanigans' and is directed at 'extremely loyal followers,' it suggests that there might be some effort to drive participation. The timeframe (until July 15) provides about 11 days for the market to reach 377 traders. Without knowing the current number of traders, it's hard to gauge how achievable this is, but let's estimate this at around 50-60% probability. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities. Using the middle values of our ranges: 0.35 * 0.55 = 0.1925. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent. If there's high interest in the election (leading to more precise polling and a lead within the specified range), it might also drive more people to participate in prediction markets. This could slightly increase the joint probability. Taking all of this into account, I would estimate the probability of both events occurring to be slightly higher than the simple multiplication would suggest, but still relatively low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

As of September 2023, it is under Ukrainian control, but Russian forces have been attempting to advance in this direction. However, predicting the state of control nearly 9 months into the future is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the conflict. Factors to consider: 1. The slow pace of Russian advances in the region over the past year. 2. Ukraine's demonstrated ability to hold defensive positions. 3. The potential for shifts in military aid to Ukraine from Western allies. 4. Possible changes in Russian military strategy or resource allocation.

As of September 2023, no state has successfully removed Trump from the ballot on these grounds. 3.

Given that Manifold is a prediction market platform, its users might be more informed or have different political leanings compared to the general population. 2.

Current political climate: As of 2023, Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, which could contribute to a preference for a generic Democrat over Biden specifically. 4. The 3% threshold: The question asks if Trump will gain at least 3% when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat. This is a significant margin, especially in political polling. 5.

Cruz has not officially announced his candidacy for 2024, and his popularity within the party has waned since his 2016 presidential run.

These factors have contributed to increased market volatility. Future outlook: By July 2024, some of the current economic pressures may have eased. Central banks might have successfully managed inflation, and the economic outlook could be more stable. However, new geopolitical or economic challenges could also emerge. Mean reversion: Volatility indices tend to revert to their mean over time. If volatility is currently high, there's a chance it might be lower in a year. Unpredictability: Market volatility is inherently difficult to predict, especially over a one-year timeframe. Unexpected events can dramatically shift market sentiment and volatility. Seasonality: While not a strong factor, there can be some seasonal patterns in volatility. However, this effect is usually minimal over a one-year period. Long-term trends: Over very long periods, markets have shown a tendency towards lower volatility as they mature. However, this effect is minimal over a one-year timeframe. Given these factors, it's difficult to say with high confidence whether the VXVCLS will be higher or lower year-over-year. The current economic uncertainties suggest volatility might remain elevated, but there's also a good chance that conditions could improve and volatility could decrease.

The probability of any specific individual dying within such a short period is generally very low, barring any known terminal illnesses or immediate threats. 4. Security measures: As the President of the United States, Biden is constantly surrounded by security personnel and has immediate access to medical care, which significantly reduces the risk of accidental death or delayed medical response. 5.

Given these factors, the probability of Joe Biden dying before Saturday, July 27, 2024, is extremely low.

The Secret Service has maintained a relatively low profile in recent months, which is generally a good sign for the agency. 3. Political climate: With 2024 being an election year in the United States, there's always a possibility of changes in leadership positions. However, the Secret Service director's role is typically seen as apolitical and not subject to change based on election cycles. 4.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There have been ongoing concerns about his age and mental acuity, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current statements and actions: As of now (July 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has already launched his 2024 campaign. 4. Party support: The Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden, and there are no significant primary challengers at this time. 5.

It's unlikely for an incumbent to wait this long to announce they're not running. 7. Historical precedent: The last incumbent president to not seek re-election was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, and he announced his decision in March of that year, much earlier than the July 2024 deadline in this question. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he's not accepting the nomination so late in the process. He has already launched his campaign, has party support, and has consistently expressed his intention to run. While age and health concerns are real factors, they don't seem to be deterring him at this point.

Time frame: The question was created on July 2, 2024, and the resolution date is August 12, 2024. This leaves a relatively short window of about 5-6 weeks for a debate to occur, which is quite limited. 3. Party unity: The Democratic party generally tries to present a united front going into a presidential election, especially when facing a Republican challenger. Debates between potential nominees could be seen as divisive and potentially harmful to the party's chances. 4. Lack of strong challengers: While names like Harris, Newsom, and Whitmer are mentioned, there hasn't been significant momentum or public calls for these individuals to challenge Biden for the nomination. 5. Biden's campaign strategy: Given Biden's age and some concerns about his public appearances, his campaign might prefer to limit his debate exposure, even within the party. 6. Historical precedent: It's uncommon for there to be debates when an incumbent president is running for re-election within their own party. 7. Late stage in the primary process: By July 2024, most primary elections and caucuses would have already taken place, further reducing the need or justification for a debate. However, we must also consider some factors that could increase the probability: 8. Potential health issues: If concerns about Biden's health or cognitive abilities significantly increase, it could prompt calls for a debate. 9. Unexpected challenger: A last-minute, high-profile challenger could potentially force a debate scenario. 10. Party strategy: If the Democratic party leadership becomes concerned about Biden's electability, they might encourage a debate to showcase alternatives. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for a debate to occur, it seems highly unlikely.

Promotion: The creator mentions being 'embroiled in some market shenanigans,' which could mean there's additional attention on this market, potentially driving more traders to join. 5. Platform dynamics: Manifold Markets is a popular prediction market platform, and interesting or controversial markets can gain traction quickly. 6. End-of-market surge: There's often increased activity as a market approaches its close, which could drive last-minute participation. Given these factors, it seems quite possible for the market to gain 78 more traders in 11 days. The current growth rate appears strong, and the creator seems invested in promoting the market. The relatively short time frame and specific goal might also create a sense of urgency among potential participants. However, there's also a chance that growth could slow down, or that the market has already captured most of the interested traders on the platform. Balancing these considerations, I believe there's a good chance the market will reach its goal, but it's not certain."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "7fdc3cae-01f1-4d70-b7f0-f1c4a147d535", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) \"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 be rated >8.5 on IMDB two days after release, and (b) the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15?", "body": "(a) \"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 (title TBA) will be rated >8.5 on IMDB two days after its release, based on the score displayed on July 30th at noon PT.

(a) \"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 rating: The question doesn't provide current ratings for Season 1 and Season 2 episodes, which would have been helpful for context. However, \"House of the Dragon\" is a highly popular show with a dedicated fan base. Season 1 generally received positive reviews, and if Season 2 maintains or improves upon that quality, a high rating is possible. An 8.5+ rating is quite high and typically reserved for exceptional episodes. Without knowing the specific content of S2E7, it's difficult to predict if it will reach this threshold. Given the show's popularity and previous performance, I'd estimate a 60% chance of S2E7 achieving a >8.5 rating. (b) Linked market reaching 377 traders: The market needs to reach 377 traders by July 15, 2024. We don't have information about the current number of traders or the rate at which new traders are joining. The market has about 11 days from the question's creation date to reach this goal. 377 traders is a significant number for a prediction market, especially one that's not about a major world event. Without more context about the market's current state or popularity, this seems like a challenging target to reach. I'd estimate a 40% chance of the market reaching 377 traders by the deadline. Combining (a) and (b): For both conditions to occur, we need to multiply the probabilities: 0.60 * 0.40 = 0.24 or 24%.

ICC's jurisdiction: The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute, but Palestine is, which gives the ICC potential jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories. 2. Ongoing investigation: The ICC has already opened an investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories, including those potentially committed by Israeli officials. 3. Current conflict: The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict since October 2023 has led to numerous allegations of war crimes and violations of international law, particularly regarding the high number of civilian casualties in Gaza. 4. International pressure: There has been increasing international pressure on Israel regarding its conduct in the conflict, with many countries and organizations calling for investigations into potential war crimes. 5. ICC's historical approach: The ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state and high-ranking officials in other conflicts, showing willingness to pursue such actions. 6. Time frame: The question gives a deadline of July 1, 2024, which is about 17 months from now. This is a significant amount of time for investigations to progress and for the ICC to make decisions. 7. Political considerations: Issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders would be a highly controversial move that could face significant opposition from Israel's allies, particularly the United States. 8. Evidence gathering: The ICC would need to gather substantial evidence to justify issuing arrest warrants, which can be challenging in ongoing conflict situations. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability that the ICC will issue arrest warrants for at least one of the listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024. The ongoing conflict, existing investigation, and international pressure increase the likelihood.

However, issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli officials would be a significant and politically sensitive move. While the ICC has shown willingness to pursue high-profile cases (e.g., the arrest warrant for Russian President Putin), Israel is not a member of the ICC, which complicates matters. The timeframe (before July 1, 2024) also limits the likelihood. I'd estimate this probability at around 0.2 or 20%. 2.

Recent political climate: While environmental issues have gained prominence in recent years, this hasn't translated into a dominant position for Green parties across Europe. Many traditional center-right and center-left parties have also adopted more environmentally friendly policies. 4. National-level performance: Green parties have seen some success in national elections in countries like Germany and Austria, but they are not the dominant force in most EU member states. 5. Competition: The EPP and S&D have historically been the two largest groups in the European Parliament and have well-established bases of support across multiple countries. 6. Polling: While specific polls for the 2024 European elections are not yet widely available, general trends do not indicate a massive surge in support for Green parties across Europe that would be necessary to overtake the larger groups. 7. Structural challenges: The Greens\u2013EFA would need to more than double their seat count to have a chance at being the largest group, which is an extremely tall order in a single election cycle. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the Greens\u2013EFA will hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections.

Biden's age and performance: Concerns about Biden's age and his administration's performance on issues like the economy and immigration could affect his standing. 7. Third-party candidates: The presence of strong third-party candidates could affect the polling gap between the two main candidates. 8. 538's methodology: 538 is known for its robust polling aggregation and tends to be more conservative in showing large leads. Given these factors, it's plausible that Trump could have a lead over Biden, but a lead between 3 and 4 points is quite specific and represents a relatively narrow range. While not impossible, it requires a precise set of circumstances to occur. A more likely scenario might be either a closer race (within 3 points) or a larger lead for either candidate. However, the question specifically asks about a lead for Trump between 3 and 4 points. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a chance for this specific outcome, but it's not highly probable. The race could easily be closer or further apart than this range."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "8c7636cc-2cb8-40ea-98b6-9b21e577e198", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Tucker Carlson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election (b) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: \n\n(a) Tucker Carlson is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Given these factors, it's plausible that Trump could have a lead over Biden, but predicting an exact range (between 2 and 3 points) is challenging. A lead in this range would indicate a close race with Trump having a slight but significant advantage. However, the specific range of 2 to 3 points is quite narrow, making it less likely to occur than a broader range. There's a higher chance that the lead could be smaller (less than 2 points) or larger (more than 3 points), or that Biden could be leading instead.

Current polling trends: As of July 2023, Biden and Trump are relatively close in national polls, with some showing a slight lead for Trump. However, we're forecasting more than a year into the future, so current polls have limited predictive power. 2. Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents often face challenges in their re-election bids, especially if economic conditions are unfavorable. However, the margin between candidates can vary widely. 3. Economic factors: The state of the economy in mid-2024 will likely play a significant role in voter preferences. Any recession or significant economic downturn could hurt Biden's chances. 4. Political developments: Ongoing investigations into Trump, potential legal issues, or any major policy successes or failures for the Biden administration could sway public opinion. 5. Campaign effectiveness: The effectiveness of each candidate's campaign strategy and messaging will influence polling numbers. 6. International events: Major international crises or conflicts could impact voter perception of Biden's leadership. 7. Third-party candidates: The presence of strong third-party candidates could affect the polling gap between Trump and Biden. 8. Voter turnout projections: Polls may adjust their likely voter models as the election approaches, potentially affecting the reported lead. Given these factors, it's plausible that Trump could have a lead over Biden, but predicting an exact range is challenging. A lead between 2 and 3 points is narrow enough to be realistic but wide enough to be significant. However, the specific range of >2 and \u22643 is quite narrow, which reduces the probability.

The political landscape can change dramatically in the next year, making it difficult to predict such a specific polling outcome. Additionally, 538's polling averages tend to be more stable and less prone to large swings, making a precise 2-3 point lead even less likely. 2.

The frontrunners for the 2024 Republican nomination are Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, with other candidates like Nikki Haley and Mike Pence also in the mix.

Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents often face challenges in re-election bids, especially if the economy or other major issues are not favorable.

The question asks for a very precise outcome, which makes it less likely to occur.

Political climate: The request by a GOP lawmaker for Merrick Garland to invoke the 25th Amendment is more likely a political move rather than a genuine concern about Biden's capacity. Such calls from opposition parties are not uncommon and rarely lead to action. Historical precedent: The 25th Amendment Section 4 has never been invoked in U.S. history.

Time frame: The question asks about this happening before August 2024, which is a relatively short time frame (about a month from the creation date of this question).

The 25th Amendment has never been invoked to remove a president involuntarily. While there have been concerns about Biden's age and occasional gaffes, there's no concrete evidence of incapacitation. The bar for invoking Section 4 is very high, requiring agreement from the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet.

For him to reverse this decision so close to the election (just a few months before the specified date) would be extremely unusual and potentially damaging to the Democratic Party.

While there are some calls for a younger or alternative candidate, Biden has not indicated he won't run, and the Democratic Party typically supports incumbent presidents.

A Trump family member as the Republican nominee: Currently, Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. He has a significant lead in polls and maintains a strong base of support within the party. While there are other candidates like Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, Trump's dominance makes him the most likely nominee. The probability of another Trump family member being nominated is extremely low. I'd estimate the probability of a Trump family member (most likely Donald Trump himself) being the nominee at around 80%. 2. Trump gaining at least 3% against Biden compared to a generic Democrat: This condition is more challenging to predict. Historically, named candidates often perform differently than generic party candidates in polls. Biden, as a known quantity, might perform better or worse than a generic Democrat depending on various factors like his approval ratings, the state of the economy, and current events. Trump has a polarizing effect, which could potentially lead to a difference in his performance against Biden versus a generic Democrat. However, a 3% difference is significant. Given that both Trump and Biden are well-known figures, the difference might not be as large as 3%. Additionally, this condition relies on specific Manifold polls, which adds another layer of uncertainty. The timing of these polls (July 6) could be influenced by campaign events, debates, or other factors that are difficult to predict this far in advance. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Trump gaining at least 3% against Biden compared to a generic Democrat in these specific polls at around 40%. To resolve YES, both conditions must be met. We can approximate the overall probability by multiplying the probabilities of each condition: 0.80 * 0.40 = 0.32 or 32%.

There have been some concerns among Democrats about Biden's age and electability, and some progressive members might prefer a more competitive primary process. However, publicly opposing the sitting president of your own party is a significant political risk. It could be seen as undermining party unity and potentially harming the party's chances in the general election. While there might be some dissent, getting 20 elected officials to publicly sign such a letter would require a substantial level of coordinated opposition that we haven't seen evidence of so far. For both of these events to occur, we would need to see a dramatic shift in the current political landscape. There would need to be a sudden and severe loss of confidence in Biden within the Democratic Party, coupled with the emergence of a strong alternative candidate or candidates. This seems highly improbable given the current political climate and the relatively short timeframe before the convention. Given these factors, the probability of both events occurring is extremely low. The probability of a brokered convention is close to zero, and while the letter scenario is slightly more plausible, it's still unlikely. The combination of these two unlikely events makes the overall probability even lower."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, there are several factors that could potentially hinder his nomination: 1. Ongoing legal issues and investigations 2. Potential emergence of strong alternative candidates 3. Possible shifts in Republican party dynamics. Despite these challenges, Trump's popularity among Republican voters remains high.

Current political landscape: As of the question's creation date (July 8, 2024), there have been no major challengers to Biden's nomination that have gained significant traction. 3. Party unity: The Democratic Party has generally shown unity behind Biden, with no prominent party members openly calling for an alternative candidate. 4.

For this condition to be met, Trump's lead would need to increase slightly but not exceed 4 points by July 15. While polls can fluctuate, a significant change in just one week is less likely. The current lead is within the required range, which increases the likelihood of this condition being met. (b) Democrats having a brokered convention in 2024: A brokered convention occurs when no candidate secures a majority of delegates in the first round of voting. This is a rare event in modern American politics. The last brokered convention for Democrats was in 1952. For this to happen in 2024: 1. There would need to be multiple strong candidates competing for the nomination. 2. The race would have to be close enough that no candidate secures a majority before the convention. Given that Joe Biden is the incumbent president, it's highly unlikely that the Democratic Party would have a contested primary, let alone a brokered convention.

(b) Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of now (2023), Donald Trump is a leading contender for the Republican nomination. He has a strong base of supporters within the party and has already announced his candidacy. However, he faces several challenges, including legal issues and competition from other Republican candidates. Given his current position in polls, his previous presidency, and his influence within the party, I estimate the probability of Trump becoming the Republican nominee to be around 60-70%. Combining probabilities: For both events to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. Using the mid-points of our estimates: (17.5% * 65%) = 11.375%.

Financial considerations: Participating in Eurovision can be expensive, and Luxembourg, being a small country, might find it challenging to allocate resources for this event. 6. Time frame: The question was created less than a month before the expected resolution date, and there have been no announcements about Luxembourg's participation. This suggests that it's highly unlikely that Luxembourg will participate in Eurovision 2024. Given these factors, especially the lack of recent participation and the short time frame before the event, it seems extremely unlikely that Luxembourg will not only participate but also qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024.

(a) Meta publishing a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024: Meta (formerly Facebook) has been increasingly involved in AI development, including large language models. Given the growing emphasis on AI safety and transparency in the tech industry, it's plausible that Meta would conduct external red-teaming of their models. However, there are a few factors to consider: 1. Meta has been somewhat less transparent about their AI development compared to some competitors. 2. The timeline (by June 30, 2024) gives them about a year from now, which is a reasonable timeframe for such an initiative. 3. External pressure and industry trends might push Meta towards this kind of transparency. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%. (b) The linked market getting at least 377 traders by July 15, 2024: Without being able to see the current state of the market, this is more challenging to estimate. However, we can consider a few points: 1. Manifold Markets is a popular prediction market platform, but not all markets gain significant traction. 2. The timeframe (until July 15, 2024) is quite long, giving ample time for traders to join. 3. The specific number (377) suggests it might be based on some current trend or expectation. Given the long timeframe and the relatively modest number of traders required, I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 70%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.70 = 0.42 or 42%.

Bitcoin Nashville's prominence: While described as 'one of the largest Bitcoin conferences,' it's not clear if it has the same draw as some other major crypto events like Bitcoin Miami. 6. Musk's other commitments: As CEO of multiple companies (Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter), Musk's schedule is likely to be very busy, which could limit his ability to attend such events. 7.

Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in multiple states to remove Trump from the ballot using the 14th Amendment. The most prominent cases are in Colorado and Minnesota, where lawsuits have been filed. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which gives ample time for legal proceedings to unfold and potentially reach state supreme courts or even the U.S. Supreme Court. 4.

Bitcoin Nashville is not as well-known as some other major crypto conferences, which might reduce the likelihood of his appearance. Additionally, Musk's schedule is often unpredictable and subject to change. Given these factors, I would estimate the probability of Musk appearing at this event to be around 0.2 or 20%. 2. Donald Trump being removed from any U.S. state primary ballot under the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024: This is a complex legal and political issue. While there have been discussions and some attempts to use the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running for office, success has been limited so far. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled definitively on this matter.

In the 2019 European Parliament elections, they won 13 out of 21 seats allocated to Hungary.

The opposition in Hungary is fragmented, which historically has benefited Fidesz-KDNP.

(b) EU announcing new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024: This is a more uncertain situation. The EU has been considering measures to protect its automotive industry from Chinese competition, particularly in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. In September 2023, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs, which could lead to tariffs. However, imposing tariffs is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders and potential diplomatic repercussions. Factors supporting the likelihood of new tariffs: 1. Growing concern about Chinese subsidies and market dominance in EVs 2. Pressure from European automakers to level the playing field 3. The EU's strategic autonomy agenda Factors against the likelihood of new tariffs: 1. Potential for retaliatory measures from China 2. Opposition from EU member states with strong trade ties to China 3. Concerns about increasing EV prices for European consumers Given these factors and the relatively short timeframe (by July 5, 2024), I would estimate the probability of the EU announcing new tariffs on Chinese EVs at around 60-65%.

Popularity of Moana: The movie has been a significant success for Disney, with a strong fan base and cultural impact. This makes it a good candidate for a theme park attraction. 2. Existing Moana presence: There's already a Moana-themed area called 'Journey of Water' at EPCOT, which opened in late 2023. This shows Disney's commitment to incorporating Moana into their parks. 3. Magic Kingdom's current lineup: Magic Kingdom is Disney World's flagship park, and they're always looking to update and refresh attractions. A Moana ride could be a good fit for Adventureland or Frontierland. 4. Disney's recent focus: Disney has been emphasizing IP-based attractions in recent years, and Moana fits well with this strategy. 5. Timing: The question specifies D23 2024, which gives Disney ample time to develop plans for a new attraction. Major announcements are often made at D23 events. 6. Competition with Universal: With Universal's Epic Universe opening in 2025, Disney might want to announce new attractions to maintain excitement for their parks. 7. Budget constraints: Disney has faced some financial challenges recently, which might impact their ability to invest in new, large-scale attractions. 8. Previous D23 patterns: Disney has a history of announcing new rides at D23, but they also sometimes discuss ideas without firm commitments. 9. Sequel factor: A Moana sequel is set to release in November 2024, which could increase interest in a Moana-themed attraction. However, there are also reasons to be cautious: 1. Recent additions: With the recent addition of TRON Lightcycle Run and the upcoming Tiana's Bayou Adventure, Magic Kingdom might not be the priority for new rides in the immediate future. 2. Other parks: Disney might choose to focus on adding Moana-themed attractions to other parks that haven't received recent updates. 3.

Part A: Disney announcing a new Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024. Disney has been investing heavily in IP-based attractions, and Moana is a popular property. The success of the Moana animated series and the announcement of a live-action Moana movie suggest Disney is keen to capitalize on this IP. Magic Kingdom is due for some updates, and a Moana-themed attraction could fit well in Adventureland. However, Disney has not hinted at any Moana-specific plans for Magic Kingdom, and they typically leak or tease major announcements. D23 is a prime venue for such announcements, but Disney might focus on other priorities or parks. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 30%. Part B: Deadpool & Wolverine having the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie. The Deadpool franchise has a strong track record, with the original holding the current record. Adding Hugh Jackman's Wolverine significantly increases star power and fan interest. The Marvel Cinematic Universe connection could draw in a broader audience. The movie's release date (July 26, 2024) is prime summer blockbuster season. The projected earnings ($340-360 million) are well above the current record ($284.5 million). However, the R-rating still limits the potential audience compared to PG-13 superhero films. Unexpected factors like poor reviews or competing releases could impact performance.

Qualification format: Typically, 10 countries qualify from each semi-final, out of approximately 16-18 participants. Given these factors, both countries have shown they can qualify, but neither is a consistent qualifier. The improvement in recent years is promising for both. However, for both to qualify, we need two independent events to occur simultaneously. If we assume their recent performance is indicative of their chances (3/5 = 60% for each), the probability of both qualifying would be 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36. However, this doesn't account for potential improvements or setbacks in 2024.

Historical precedent: In recent presidential elections, polling averages have tended to tighten as Election Day approaches. However, this is not always the case, and the 2024 election might be unique due to various factors. 4. Potential events: Major events such as debates, economic changes, or international incidents could sway public opinion in either direction. 5. Candidate performance: How well each candidate campaigns and performs in public appearances could affect their polling numbers. 6. Margin of error: Polling averages typically have a margin of error, which could affect whether Trump's lead falls within the specified range. 7. 538's methodology: 538's polling average is weighted and adjusted based on various factors, which could influence the final number. Given that Trump already has a 2.4-point lead as of July 5, 2024, it's plausible that his lead could remain within the 2-3 point range by July 15. However, there's also a significant chance that his lead could increase beyond 3 points or decrease below 2 points due to the factors mentioned above. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Trump's lead will be between 2 and 3 points on July 15, 2024. It's not the most likely outcome, as there are many possibilities outside this range, but it's certainly a plausible scenario."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "9b62317c-e34b-4456-b7a0-1b104187c214", "title": "Will Israel carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves **Yes** if, following the date of this question's publication and before May 1, 2024, credible reports indicate that an attack attributed to Israel and occurring within Iran's borders has led to the death of at least five individuals.", "resolution_date": "2024-05-01T18:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-13T22:04:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.35, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, we need to consider several factors: 1. Current geopolitical tensions: The relationship between Israel and Iran has been highly antagonistic for decades, with both countries viewing each other as existential threats. Recent events, including Iran's support for Hamas and other militant groups, have further escalated tensions. 2. Historical precedent: Israel has a history of covert operations and targeted attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities and personnel.

Escalation risks: A direct, deadly attack by Israel within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation, potentially leading to a wider regional conflict. This risk might make Israel hesitant to carry out such an operation. 5. International pressure: The ongoing conflict in Gaza has already put Israel under international scrutiny. A direct attack on Iran might further isolate Israel diplomatically. 6. Iran's recent actions: Iran's drone and missile attack on Israel on April 13, 2024, in response to an alleged Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, has significantly heightened tensions between the two countries. 7. Israel's potential retaliation: Given the recent Iranian attack, Israel might be more inclined to retaliate with a direct strike on Iranian soil, potentially meeting the criteria of this question. 8. Tactical considerations: Israel might prefer cyber attacks or more covert operations that are less likely to result in multiple casualties, to avoid full-scale war.

Historical context: The VXVCLS is a measure of market expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option prices. It tends to increase during periods of economic uncertainty or market stress. Current economic situation: As of April 2024, the global economy is still recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with ongoing concerns about inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. Comparison to July 2023: We need to consider the economic conditions and market sentiment in July 2023 as a baseline. Without specific data for that date, we can assume it was a period of relative stability as the world continued to recover from the pandemic. Future outlook: By July 2024, there are several factors that could influence market volatility: a) Potential for new economic challenges or global events b) Ongoing effects of monetary policies implemented by central banks c) Possible technological disruptions or geopolitical tensions d) Natural progression of the economic cycle, which might be entering a different phase. Market adaptability: Markets tend to adapt to ongoing situations, potentially reducing volatility over time as uncertainties become 'priced in.' Mean reversion: Volatility indices often exhibit mean reversion, meaning extremely high or low values tend to move back towards long-term averages over time. Given these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher chance that the VXVCLS will be lower in July 2024 compared to July 2023. This is based on the assumption that markets will have had more time to adapt to post-pandemic conditions, and barring any major new global crises, volatility might slightly decrease.

(a) CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS): The VXVCLS is a measure of market expectations of near-term volatility. Predicting its value more than a year in advance is challenging due to the many factors that can influence market volatility. However, we can consider some general trends: 1. As of April 2023, the VXVCLS has been relatively low compared to historical averages, suggesting potential for increase. 2. Economic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions, and potential policy changes could lead to increased volatility. 3. However, markets tend to adapt to ongoing situations, potentially reducing volatility over time. Given these factors, I'd estimate a 55% chance of the VXVCLS being higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024. (b) Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024: This is a highly sensitive geopolitical issue. Several factors to consider: 1. Ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear program. 2. Recent history of covert operations and cyberattacks attributed to Israel against Iranian targets. 3. The relatively short timeframe (less than a year) reduces the likelihood of such a significant event occurring. 4. International pressure to avoid escalation in the region. 5. The high threshold (at least five deaths) makes this less likely than a smaller-scale operation. Considering these factors, I'd estimate a 20% chance of Israel carrying out such an attack before May 1, 2024. For both events to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities: 0.55 * 0.20 = 0.11 or 11%. This calculation assumes the events are independent, which may not be entirely accurate as increased geopolitical tensions could affect market volatility. However, given the complexity of the relationship, this simplification is reasonable for this estimate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Nikki Haley being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Currently, Nikki Haley is running for the Republican nomination, but she faces significant challenges. The frontrunner for the Republican nomination is Donald Trump, who maintains a substantial lead in most polls. Other candidates like Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott also have considerable support. While Haley has experience as a former governor and UN ambassador, her polling numbers have consistently been lower than Trump's and often behind DeSantis. The likelihood of her securing the nomination seems low at this point, barring any major unexpected events. 2. Joe Biden still being president by the end of July 2024: This part is more likely to occur. Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has announced his intention to run for re-election. Barring any unforeseen health issues or other extraordinary circumstances, it's highly probable that he will remain president until at least the end of July 2024, which is before the general election in November. Combining these two events, we need both to occur for a 'Yes' resolution. While the second part (Biden remaining president) is quite likely, the first part (Haley becoming the Republican nominee) is much less probable.

Given that Trump's lead is already within the specified range (2.4 points on July 5), and considering the short timeframe and the general stability of polling averages, there's a good chance the lead will remain within this range. However, it's also possible that it could slightly increase or decrease due to normal polling fluctuations or minor campaign events.

Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Biden will participate in at least one qualifying interview before the end of July 2024.

However, as we approach the 2024 election, there might be increased pressure for him to engage more with the media.

Let's break it down: (a) Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average: As of the creation date (July 9, 2024), Trump has a 2.4-point lead over Biden. For this condition to be met, Trump's lead would need to remain relatively stable or increase slightly over the next week.

The presidential term runs until January 20, 2025, and it's very rare for a sitting president to leave office before the end of their term. The only scenarios where this wouldn't be the case would be impeachment and removal, resignation, or death/incapacitation. While Biden's age is a factor to consider, the probability of him not being president by the end of July 2024 is quite low.

Number of countries without gold medals: As of 2023, there are still over 70 countries that have never won an Olympic gold medal. This provides a large pool of potential first-time winners. 3. Emerging sports powerhouses: Some countries have been investing heavily in their Olympic programs and have been improving their performances in recent years. For example, countries like India (which has limited gold medals) have been focusing on sports like wrestling, shooting, and badminton. 4. New Olympic sports: The 2024 Olympics will feature new sports like breaking (breakdancing), which could provide opportunities for countries with strengths in these areas to win their first gold. 5. Competitive landscape: The Olympics are becoming increasingly competitive, with more countries developing world-class athletes. This could make it harder for new countries to break through. 6. Time frame: The question is specifically about the 2024 Olympics, not a longer period, which limits the opportunities for multiple countries to achieve this milestone. 7. COVID-19 impact: The pandemic disrupted training and competition schedules for many athletes, potentially leveling the playing field to some extent and creating opportunities for unexpected victories. Given these factors, while it's certainly possible for 5 or more countries to win their first gold medal, it seems unlikely. The historical precedent suggests that 2-3 countries winning their first gold in a single Olympics is more common. However, the introduction of new sports and the large number of countries still seeking their first gold do increase the chances somewhat."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "609572cd-08c9-49e1-9fdb-b3f7c80c8f4e", "title": "Will a swimmer win the most gold medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics and will at least 5 countries win their debut gold medal at the 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if both of the following occur: (a) The athlete with the highest number of 2024 Olympic gold medals competes in the swimming events.

Swimmers like Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz, and more recently, Caeleb Dressel have dominated medal counts in past Olympics. The nature of swimming events, with multiple strokes and distances, allows versatile swimmers to compete in numerous events. However, track and field athletes can also win multiple medals, as can gymnasts in a good year. For the 2024 Olympics, while it's difficult to predict exactly who will dominate, swimming remains a strong contender for producing the top gold medal winner. Athletes like Caeleb Dressel (USA) and Emma McKeon (Australia) could potentially win multiple golds. I'd estimate the probability of a swimmer winning the most gold medals at around 60-70%. b) At least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal: This is a more challenging condition to meet. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, only three countries won their first-ever gold medals: Bermuda, Philippines, and Qatar. In 2016 Rio Olympics, five countries (Fiji, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, and Singapore) won their first gold. For this to happen in 2024, we would need an unusually high number of debut gold medalists. While it's possible, especially with new sports being added to the Olympic program, it's not highly probable based on recent trends. I'd estimate the probability of at least 5 countries winning their first gold at around 20-30%. Combining these probabilities: For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities. Even taking the higher end of both estimates (70% * 30%), we get 21%. This suggests that while it's possible for both conditions to be met, it's not highly likely.

For example, in Tokyo 2020, only three countries (Bermuda, Philippines, and Qatar) won their first gold medals. In Rio 2016, it was two (Fiji and Kosovo). However, with new sports being added to the Olympic program and the continuous development of sports programs in various countries, there's a possibility for more debut gold medals. Still, reaching 5 is quite ambitious. 2. Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals: This condition is highly dependent on the geopolitical situation, particularly regarding Russian and Belarusian athletes. As of now, these athletes are allowed to compete as neutral athletes in Paris 2024, but with restrictions. Historically, Russia has been a strong performer in the Olympics, often winning numerous gold medals. However, the 'Individual Neutral Athletes' designation and the restrictions placed on these athletes could potentially impact their performance or participation numbers. For context, in Tokyo 2020, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) won 20 gold medals. In Rio 2016, Russia won 19 gold medals. However, these were full teams, not restricted 'Individual Neutral Athletes.' Considering both conditions together: The probability of both these events occurring simultaneously is lower than either event occurring individually. While it's possible for Individual Neutral Athletes to win 15 or more gold medals (though still challenging), the requirement for 5 countries to win their first gold medal makes this combined outcome quite unlikely.

This could potentially happen if there's a significant shift in political alliances. 7.

Recent trends: There has been a rise in populist and far-right parties across Europe in recent years, which could potentially benefit the ID group. 3.

Competition: Other groups like the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) have traditionally been much larger and have established bases across multiple countries. 7.

Injury status: Without current information about any injuries, we have to assume she's in good health. Any injuries in the lead-up to the Olympics could significantly impact her chances. 6. Olympic schedule: The schedule of events could impact her performance if she attempts to compete in multiple races as she did in Tokyo. However, her previous success in this challenging schedule suggests she can handle it well. 7. Training and preparation: Given her previous success and professional status, it's likely that she has a strong support team and optimal training conditions. 8. Motivation: As a defending champion in two events, Hassan likely has high motivation to perform well and defend her titles. Given these factors, especially her outstanding performance in the previous Olympics and her ability to compete at a high level in multiple events, I believe Sifan Hassan has a very good chance of winning at least one medal in Paris.

There are no indications that Biden's own administration doubts his capacity to serve. 6. Democratic Party stance: With the 2024 election approaching, it's highly unlikely that the Democratic Party would support such a drastic move, as it would severely damage their chances in the upcoming election. 7. Public perception: While there are concerns about Biden's age, there isn't widespread public demand for his removal due to incapacity. Given these factors, it appears highly unlikely that Biden will be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024. While it's not impossible, it would require a sudden and severe decline in Biden's health or cognitive abilities, coupled with a rapid shift in political will from his own administration."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a19d44da-613e-466d-ab2b-37cbbce5ac32", "title": "Before July 1, 2024, will the International Criminal Court issue arrest warrants for any of the listed Israeli leaders?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if before July 1, 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issues a [warrant of arrest](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works) for any of the below listed Israeli cabinet members.

ICC's jurisdiction: The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute, but Palestine is, which gives the ICC potential jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories. 2. Ongoing investigation: In March 2021, the ICC opened a formal investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories. This investigation is still ongoing and includes actions by both Israeli and Palestinian actors. 3. Current conflict: The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict since October 2023 has led to numerous allegations of war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law, particularly regarding the high civilian death toll in Gaza. 4. International pressure: There has been growing international concern and criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza, which could increase pressure on the ICC to act. 5. ICC's track record: The ICC has historically been slow to issue arrest warrants, especially for high-ranking officials of powerful countries. It tends to focus on less politically sensitive cases. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a relatively short time frame (about 14 months from the question's creation date), which limits the likelihood of the ICC completing its investigation and issuing warrants. 7. Political considerations: Issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli officials would be a highly controversial move that could face significant political backlash, particularly from Israel's allies like the United States. 8. Precedent: The ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state (e.g., Sudan's Omar al-Bashir), but these cases are rare and usually involve less geopolitically complex situations. Given these factors, while there is a possibility of the ICC issuing arrest warrants for the listed Israeli leaders, it seems unlikely to happen within the specified timeframe. The ICC's investigations and legal processes tend to be lengthy, and the political sensitivity of such a move would likely cause additional delays.

Fundraising and campaign infrastructure: While Haley has been able to raise funds, she is still behind Trump and some other potential candidates in this aspect. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Haley to become the nominee, it appears highly unlikely at this point. Trump's strong lead and continued support from the Republican base make him the most likely nominee by a significant margin. Haley would need a major shift in the political landscape or a significant change in party dynamics to have a realistic chance at securing the nomination."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "7fa8af3b-7847-44ef-82a3-3bd9110375b6", "title": "Will Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August?", "body": "Resolves YES if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) invokes Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time).\n\nThe duration of the incapacity does not matter for this question.\n\nBiden exiting the office of the Presidency by death, resignation, etc does not count.

Ongoing investigation: The Georgia case is still active, and investigators may uncover new evidence or witness statements that could lead to additional charges. 3.

This provides ample time for investigators to gather evidence and for prosecutors to file additional charges if warranted. 5.

However, we need to determine if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. 2. Manifold user base: Manifold is a prediction market platform that tends to attract users who are more politically engaged and potentially more informed than the average voter. This could lead to different voting patterns compared to general public polls. 3. Time frame: The polls close on July 6, which is very close to the creation date of this question (July 4). This short timeframe limits the potential for significant shifts in opinion. 4. Specific vs. generic candidate: Generally, a generic candidate tends to perform better than a specific candidate because people can project their ideal qualities onto the generic option. This suggests that Trump might perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat. 5. Current political climate: As of July 2024, Biden has been facing challenges related to his age, some policy issues, and general voter fatigue. This could contribute to Trump performing better against Biden specifically. 6. 3% threshold: The question asks if Trump will gain at least 3% more votes against Biden compared to a generic Democrat. This is a significant margin, especially considering the short timeframe. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Trump will perform better against Biden compared to a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. However, the 3% threshold is quite high, and the short timeframe makes it less likely for such a significant difference to materialize. Manifold users are likely more informed about specific candidates and current political dynamics, which could lead to a more pronounced difference between Biden and a generic Democrat.

Ongoing Efforts: There are already efforts underway in several states to challenge Trump's eligibility under the 14th Amendment. For example, in August 2023, a lawsuit was filed in Florida seeking to bar Trump from the ballot. 3. Trump's Actions: The argument for disqualification stems from Trump's alleged role in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.

Some states may be more likely than others to entertain such challenges. 5. Time Frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which allows ample time for legal challenges to be filed, argued, and potentially decided in multiple states. 6. Political Climate: The political divisiveness surrounding Trump could motivate more aggressive legal actions in some states. 7. Legal Hurdles: While challenges may be filed, they face significant legal hurdles. The Supreme Court has not ruled on this specific use of the 14th Amendment, and lower courts may be hesitant to set such a precedent without clear guidance. 8.
