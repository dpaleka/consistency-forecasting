Competition: The Republican field for 2024 is already crowded with more prominent figures. Former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are considered the top contenders, with others like Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, and Vivek Ramaswamy also in the race. 3. Lack of national profile: While Youngkin has gained attention for his gubernatorial win in Virginia, he lacks the national profile and donor network that many of his potential competitors have built over years. 4.

This limited experience in executive office might be seen as a disadvantage compared to other candidates with longer track records. 5. No declared candidacy: As of now, Youngkin has not officially declared his intention to run for president in 2024. While this doesn't rule out a future announcement, it puts him behind others who have already launched their campaigns. 6.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Current intentions: As of now (July 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He has already launched his re-election campaign and is actively fundraising. 3.

This has raised concerns about his ability to serve effectively for another four years. However, he has maintained that he is fit for office. 4. Party support: Despite some concerns about his age, Biden still enjoys significant support within the Democratic Party. There is no clear alternative candidate who could unite the party as effectively. 5.

Incumbent advantage: As the sitting Vice President, Harris might benefit from the incumbent advantage, but this is already likely factored into her current odds. 6.

Given these factors, while it's possible for Harris's odds to increase slightly, there isn't a strong reason to expect a significant change in such a short time frame.

(a) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination: As of now (July 2024), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. It is extremely rare for an incumbent president to withdraw from seeking re-nomination, especially this close to the election. Biden has consistently expressed his commitment to running, and his campaign is actively preparing for the 2024 race. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, there are no strong indications that Biden is considering stepping aside. The deadline (July 15, 2024) is also very close, leaving little time for such a major decision to be made and announced. The probability of this occurring is very low. (b) Kamala Harris's odds increasing according to Nate Silver's model: This part is more challenging to predict without current data from Nate Silver's model. However, we can make some educated guesses. As the sitting Vice President, Harris is naturally positioned as a potential alternative if Biden were to step aside. Any negative news about Biden's campaign or health could potentially boost Harris's chances. Additionally, a strong performance by Harris in a debate or a major policy announcement could improve her standing. However, the specific threshold of 46.6% is quite high for a candidate who is not the presumptive nominee. Without a major shake-up in the race, it's unlikely her odds would jump so significantly in just one week. The probability of this occurring is low to moderate. Combining these factors, we need to consider that only one of these events needs to occur for the question to resolve as YES.

However, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned this decision in March 2024, ruling that states cannot unilaterally disqualify candidates for federal office under the 14th Amendment. 2.

Several states have attempted to remove Trump from their ballots, citing his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot. However, as of now, no state has successfully and permanently removed him.

He ran unsuccessfully for Governor of California in the 2021 recall election but has never held elected office. This lack of experience in governance could be a significant disadvantage. Name recognition: While Elder has some national recognition due to his media presence as a conservative talk radio host and political commentator, his name recognition is not on par with other potential candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Mike Pence. Fundraising ability: Elder would likely struggle to raise the substantial funds required for a competitive presidential campaign compared to more established politicians or well-known figures in the Republican Party. Party support: There's no indication that Elder has significant support from the Republican establishment or key party leaders, which is crucial for securing the nomination. Competition: The field of potential Republican candidates is likely to be crowded with more experienced and well-known politicians, making it harder for Elder to stand out. Ideological positioning: While Elder's conservative views align with much of the Republican base, other candidates may have similar positions and more political capital to leverage. Time until the convention: The Republican National Convention is still over a year away, which theoretically gives Elder time to build a campaign and support. However, many other candidates have already started positioning themselves or have declared their candidacy.

Francis Suarez's position: - Suarez is a lesser-known candidate on the national stage. - As the Mayor of Miami, he has limited national political experience. - He hasn't gained significant traction in national polls so far. 3. Other candidates: - There are several other prominent candidates in the race, such as Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence. - Some of these candidates have stronger national profiles than Suarez. 4. Historical context: - Incumbent presidents or former presidents (like Trump) who seek their party's nomination again often succeed. 5. Time until the convention: - There's still significant time before the Republican National Convention, allowing for shifts in the political landscape. Given these factors, Donald Trump has a high probability of becoming the nominee due to his current frontrunner status and strong base support. However, his legal issues introduce some uncertainty. Francis Suarez, on the other hand, has a very low probability due to his limited national profile and current lack of significant support in polls. Combining these probabilities, and considering that we only need one of them to be the nominee for a YES resolution, I would estimate the probability as follows: Probability: 0.75. This probability reflects a high likelihood of Trump becoming the nominee, with a very small additional probability accounting for the unlikely scenario of Suarez winning the nomination.

Christie's position: Chris Christie has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump, which puts him at odds with a large portion of the Republican base that still strongly supports Trump. 3. Polling data: Current polls show Christie with very low support among Republican voters, typically in the low single digits. 4. Fundraising: Christie's campaign has not demonstrated the level of fundraising necessary to mount a competitive national campaign against better-funded opponents. 5. Name recognition: While Christie has national name recognition from his previous presidential run and his time as New Jersey governor, he hasn't maintained a high profile in recent years. 6. Competition: Besides Trump, there are other candidates like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy who are polling higher than Christie and have more momentum. 7. Christie's strategy: His campaign seems to be focused on being the anti-Trump candidate, which may appeal to a segment of Republican voters but is unlikely to win over the majority of the party. 8. Historical precedent: It's rare for a candidate polling as low as Christie to make a comeback and win the nomination, especially against an incumbent-like figure such as Trump. 9. Time until convention: While there is still time for dynamics to change before the Republican National Convention, the current trajectory does not favor Christie. 10. Party unity concerns: The Republican establishment might prefer a candidate who can unite the party, and Christie's confrontational approach towards Trump might be seen as divisive.

However, they lack direct political experience and have not shown clear intentions to run. 3. Current political landscape: The Republican Party is divided between Trump loyalists and those seeking to move beyond the Trump era. This division could either solidify support for Trump or create an opening for a non-Trump candidate. 4. Legal challenges: Donald Trump faces several legal investigations and potential indictments, which could impact his ability to run or his appeal to voters. 5.

Given these factors, Donald Trump remains the most likely Trump family member to secure the nomination. While his chances are significant, they are not certain due to legal challenges and party division. Other Trump family members have a much lower probability of becoming the nominee.

Legal precedent: There have been attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates, but they have rarely been successful. The most notable recent case was the attempt to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene from the ballot in Georgia, which failed. 2. Trump's involvement in the January 6th events: The events of January 6, 2021, and Trump's role in them are central to arguments for invoking Section 3. While many view his actions as insurrectionary, there's no legal consensus on this interpretation. 3. State-level actions: Some states might be more inclined to attempt removal than others. Blue states might be more likely to try, but they would face significant legal challenges. 4. Legal challenges: Any attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would likely face immediate and vigorous legal challenges, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. 5. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the general election. Most primary elections would likely be concluded by then, reducing the likelihood of last-minute ballot removals. 6. Political implications: Removing a major candidate from the ballot would be an extraordinary step with significant political repercussions, which might make states hesitant. 7. Supreme Court composition: The current Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, might be skeptical of attempts to remove Trump from the ballot. Despite these factors, there are some reasons why removal might occur: 1. Ongoing investigations: Trump faces several investigations which could potentially provide new evidence relevant to a Section 3 case. 2. Precedent setting: The Colorado Supreme Court's recent decision to remove Trump from the state's primary ballot sets a significant precedent, even if it's likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 3. Multiple state attempts: With numerous states potentially considering this action, the likelihood of at least one succeeding increases. Given these considerations, I believe there is a significant chance that at least one state will attempt to remove Trump from the ballot, and there's a non-trivial possibility that such an attempt could succeed and remain in effect as of July 15, 2024.

However, there are significant legal and political hurdles to overcome: 1. The application of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to a presidential candidate is unprecedented and legally complex. 2. Any attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would likely face immediate legal challenges and could be tied up in courts for an extended period. 3. Many Republican-controlled states are unlikely to pursue this option. 4. The Supreme Court might ultimately need to weigh in on this issue, which could take time.

Historical dominance: The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and INC (Indian National Congress) have been the two major national parties in India for decades. Since 1996, either the BJP or the INC has led the government after every general election. 2. Current political landscape: The BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been in power since 2014 and won a significant majority in the 2019 elections.

However, there are efforts to form a united opposition front against the BJP, which could potentially boost the INC's chances. 4. Regional parties: While the question specifically asks about the BJP and INC, it's worth noting that regional parties play a significant role in Indian politics. However, they typically align with one of the two major national parties to form coalitions. 5. Recent state elections: Results from state elections can provide insights into national trends. The BJP has had mixed results in recent state elections, winning some and losing others, which suggests that their dominance is not absolute. 6.

Trump's legal challenges: Trump is facing multiple legal challenges, including federal indictments. While these could potentially impact his candidacy, they have not significantly diminished his support among Republican voters so far. 3. Other candidates: Several other candidates have announced their intention to run, including Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence. However, none have gained significant traction against Trump in polls. 4. Ted Cruz's position: Ted Cruz has not officially announced a 2024 presidential run. He ran in 2016 and came second to Trump in the primaries, but his current focus seems to be on his Senate role. 5. Historical precedent: It's rare for a party to nominate someone other than a former president or vice president when one is running. This favors Trump. 6. Party dynamics: The Republican Party has largely aligned itself with Trump's policies and rhetoric since 2016, which could make it difficult for other candidates to gain traction. Given these factors, Donald Trump appears to have a very high chance of securing the nomination. While there are potential obstacles (legal issues, party fatigue with Trump), his current position seems strong. Ted Cruz's chances appear much lower, as he hasn't announced a run and doesn't have the same level of support as Trump.

Biden is the incumbent, which typically favors running for re-election. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden is currently the oldest serving president, and he would be 82 at the start of a second term.

(a) A group of at least 5 named Democratic House Members or US Senators pressuring Biden to drop out: This scenario is unlikely but not impossible. As of now, Biden has maintained strong support within the Democratic Party, despite some concerns about his age and approval ratings. However, if his poll numbers were to significantly decline or if a major scandal were to emerge, some party members might feel compelled to act. The timeframe (before July 20th) is relatively short, which reduces the likelihood of this occurring. Additionally, such a move would be seen as highly divisive within the party and could potentially harm Democrats' chances in the general election. Therefore, this scenario has a low probability. (b) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination: This scenario is even less likely. Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election and has already launched his campaign. Barring a severe health issue or an unforeseen major scandal, it's highly improbable that he would suddenly decide to withdraw. The Democratic Party has largely rallied behind him, and there isn't a clear alternative candidate who could step in at this late stage. Biden and his team understand the importance of party unity and the potential chaos that would ensue if he were to drop out so close to the election. Additional factors to consider: 1. Time constraint: The resolution date is July 23, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). This leaves little time for major political shifts. 2.

For a woman to become the nominee, either Biden would need to step aside, or a female candidate would need to mount a successful primary challenge.

However, it's not entirely out of the question, especially if Biden's health or polling numbers decline significantly. I would estimate the probability of this occurring at around 20%.

Taylor Swift cameo in Deadpool and Wolverine: Taylor Swift is known for her surprise appearances and cameos, and she has a connection to the Deadpool franchise through her friendship with Ryan Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively. However, there's no concrete evidence or rumors suggesting she will appear in this movie. Swift is primarily focused on her music career and her ongoing Eras Tour. While a cameo is possible, it's not highly probable. 2. Deadpool and Wolverine having the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie: This scenario is more likely. The previous record is held by the original Deadpool at $284.5 million. Several factors support the possibility of breaking this record: a) The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine, two highly popular characters, in one movie. b) The return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, which has generated significant buzz. c) The integration of these characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, potentially drawing a wider audience. d) The success of the previous Deadpool movies and the general popularity of superhero films. e) Inflation and increased ticket prices since the release of the original Deadpool. f) Pent-up demand for blockbuster movies post-pandemic. Given these factors, there's a good chance that 'Deadpool x Wolverine' could break the R-rated opening weekend record. However, it's not a certainty, as the movie industry can be unpredictable, and other factors like competition, reviews, and global events can impact box office performance.

Name recognition: While Ramaswamy has gained some attention, he still lacks the widespread name recognition that other candidates possess. This can be a significant hurdle in a national primary race. 3. Political experience: Ramaswamy is a businessman and author with no prior political experience. Historically, candidates with political experience tend to fare better in presidential primaries. 4. Fundraising: While Ramaswamy has personal wealth, his campaign fundraising efforts may not match those of more established candidates, which could limit his ability to compete effectively across multiple states. 5. Policy positions: Some of Ramaswamy's policy positions, while appealing to certain segments of the Republican base, may be too unconventional or extreme for the broader Republican electorate. 6. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still some time away, which theoretically gives Ramaswamy time to build support. However, it also means that unforeseen events or changes in the political landscape could further diminish his chances. 7. Competition: The Republican field includes several high-profile candidates with strong bases of support, making it difficult for a relative newcomer like Ramaswamy to break through. 8.

This shows that prosecutors are willing to pursue charges against him. 2. Ongoing investigation: The Georgia case is still active, and prosecutors may uncover additional evidence or witness testimony that could lead to further charges. 3. Trump's public statements: Trump has a history of making public statements about potential witnesses, which could be interpreted as attempts to influence their testimony. However, no specific recent statements related to Georgia witnesses have been widely reported. 4.

Political considerations: Charging a former president with additional crimes is a significant decision that prosecutors would not take lightly. They may be cautious about adding charges unless the evidence is overwhelming. 6. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of June 1, 2024, which is about 7 months away. This provides a reasonable amount of time for investigators to gather evidence and for prosecutors to make decisions about additional charges. 7. Precedent: While Trump has been charged with witness tampering in the federal classified documents case, that doesn't necessarily mean Georgia prosecutors will follow suit unless they have similar strong evidence. 8. Focus on existing charges: Prosecutors may choose to focus on the existing charges rather than expanding the case, especially given the complexity of the current indictment. Given these factors, while it's possible that Trump could be charged with witness tampering, it seems less likely than not.

Vivek Ramaswamy becoming the Republican nominee: Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new face in politics and is considered a long-shot candidate for the Republican nomination. As of now, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are seen as the frontrunners for the nomination. While Ramaswamy has gained some attention for his campaign, his chances of securing the nomination are quite low. Most polls and political analysts give him a very small chance of winning the nomination, typically less than 5%. 2. Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024: Donald Trump is currently under investigation in Georgia for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. While there have been indications that charges might be brought against him, it's not certain that witness tampering will be among them. However, given the ongoing investigation and the seriousness of the allegations, there is a moderate chance that such charges could be filed before June 1, 2024. The Fulton County District Attorney has been actively pursuing the case, and legal experts have suggested that charges are likely to be filed at some point. Combining these two events, we need to consider the probability of either occurring. Since they are independent events, we can use the rule of probability for 'or' events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Given that Ramaswamy's chances of securing the nomination are very low (let's estimate generously at 5%), and the chances of Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024, are moderate (let's estimate at 40%), we can calculate: P(Either event) = 0.05 + 0.40 - (0.05 * 0.40) = 0.43.

Recent events, including Iran's support for Hamas and other anti-Israel groups, have further escalated tensions. 2. Historical precedent: Israel has a history of conducting covert operations and targeted attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities and military personnel. However, these have typically been more limited in scope and casualties. 3.

Escalation risks: A direct, deadly attack by Israel within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation, potentially leading to a wider regional conflict. This risk might make Israel hesitant to carry out such an operation. 5. International pressure: The ongoing conflict in Gaza has already put Israel under significant international scrutiny. A major attack on Iranian soil could further isolate Israel diplomatically. 6. Iranian retaliation capability: Iran has significant retaliatory capabilities, including its missile program and proxy forces throughout the region. This could serve as a deterrent for Israel. 7. Recent events: The April 13 Iranian attack on Israel using drones and missiles, although largely intercepted, may increase the likelihood of an Israeli response.

The Guardian Council typically approves candidates well in advance of elections, and the next Iranian presidential election is not scheduled until 2025.

Strategic importance: Chasiv Yar is strategically important due to its location west of Bakhmut, which Russia captured in 2023. Taking Chasiv Yar would allow Russia to push further into Donetsk Oblast. 3. Time frame: The question resolves on June 1, 2024, giving Russia about 13 months to capture the town from the creation date of this question. 4. Recent Russian offensive capabilities: Russia has shown some ability to make slow, grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, but at a high cost. 5. Ukrainian defensive capabilities: Ukraine has demonstrated strong defensive skills and has been receiving continued Western support, although the level of future support is uncertain. 6. Historical context: The war has been ongoing since 2022, and while Russia has made some gains, they have been slow and costly. 7.

Given these factors, I believe it's more likely that Chasiv Yar will remain under Ukrainian control by June 1, 2024. While Russia has the motivation to capture the town and has shown the ability to make slow advances, the timeframe of 13 months is relatively short for significant territorial gains given the current pace of the conflict. Ukraine's defensive capabilities and potential continued Western support make it challenging for Russia to achieve this objective. However, the situation is highly uncertain, and a concentrated Russian effort could potentially succeed in capturing the town. The proximity to the front line and its strategic importance make it a viable target for Russian forces.

Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024: Chasiv Yar is a strategically important town in eastern Ukraine, close to Bakhmut. As of now (April 2024), Russia has been making slow but steady progress in the region. However, Ukrainian forces have been putting up strong resistance. Given the current pace of Russian advances and the time frame (about 13 months from now), it's possible but not highly likely that Russia will control Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024. I'd estimate this probability at around 30%. 2. Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination: As of now, Joe Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024 and is the presumptive Democratic nominee. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have consistently reaffirmed his intention to run. It would be highly unusual and politically disruptive for an incumbent president to withdraw from the race, especially this late in the election cycle. The probability of Biden making such an announcement is very low, perhaps around 5%. To calculate the overall probability, we need to consider the chance of either event occurring. The probability of at least one of these events happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of neither event happening: 1 - ((1 - 0.30) * (1 - 0.05)) = 1 - (0.70 * 0.95) = 1 - 0.665 = 0.335.

Current standing: As of now, Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new face in national politics. He has gained some attention for his conservative views and business background, but he lacks the political experience and name recognition of many other potential candidates. 2. Competition: The Republican field for 2024 is likely to be crowded with more established politicians. Former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and other high-profile Republicans are expected to run or are already running. These candidates have stronger bases of support and greater resources. 3. Polling: In current polls for the Republican primary, Ramaswamy consistently ranks low, often in the single digits. He trails far behind frontrunners like Trump and DeSantis. 4. Fundraising: While Ramaswamy has personal wealth, his campaign fundraising lags behind top-tier candidates. This could limit his ability to compete effectively across multiple states. 5. Party establishment support: Ramaswamy has not secured significant endorsements from Republican Party leaders or influential conservative groups, which are often crucial for winning the nomination. 6. Media attention: While he has received some media coverage, it's not at the level of the top-tier candidates, which makes it harder for him to build broad national recognition. 7. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still some time away, which theoretically gives Ramaswamy time to build support. However, it also means that unforeseen events or new candidates could further complicate his path. 8. Historical precedent: It's rare for a political newcomer with no prior elected office to secure a major party nomination, although not impossible (as seen with Trump in 2016). Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Ramaswamy to become the nominee, it appears highly unlikely. He would need to overcome significant obstacles and see a dramatic shift in the current political landscape to have a realistic chance."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a0ed46ec-c8b0-416c-85ed-d9f043ad8931", "title": "Will Rishi Sunak fail to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if for any reason Rishi Sunak fails to be elected as a Member of Parliament in the July 4 2024 UK general election.\n\nIf Sunak is elected as a Member of Parliament for any constituency in the July 4 2024 UK general election, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nResolution should cite [credible](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) media reports, or an official announcement from the returning officer of the constituency in which Sunak is a candidate (if he is a candidate in any constituency).", "resolution_date": "2024-07-04T22:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-02-22T16:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.05, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of Rishi Sunak failing to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election, we need to consider several factors: 1.

Part A: Vivek Ramaswamy being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new entrant in the Republican primary race. While he has gained some attention for his outspoken views and business background, he faces significant challenges: 1. He lacks political experience, which is often seen as crucial for a presidential nominee. 2. He is competing against more established and well-known candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others. 3. Current polling data shows him significantly behind the frontrunners. 4. The Republican establishment tends to favor candidates with more traditional political backgrounds. Given these factors, the probability of Ramaswamy securing the nomination is very low, likely less than 1%. Part B: Rishi Sunak failing to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election. Rishi Sunak is the current Prime Minister of the UK and leader of the Conservative Party. While his position as PM doesn't guarantee re-election as an MP, several factors suggest he's likely to retain his seat: 1. Sunak represents Richmond (Yorks), a safe Conservative seat that he won with a large majority in 2019. 2. Incumbent MPs, especially party leaders, typically have a strong advantage in their constituencies. 3. Even if the Conservative Party performs poorly overall, party leaders usually retain their seats. However, there are some factors that could potentially work against him: 1. The Conservative Party's overall popularity has declined since the last election. 2. Unexpected local issues or a strong challenger could emerge. 3. There's always a small chance of a major scandal or unforeseen event. Given these factors, the probability of Sunak failing to be elected is also quite low, perhaps around 5-10%. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the upper bound of our estimates and the formula for the probability of either of two events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.01 + 0.10 - (0.01 * 0.10) = 0.109 or approximately 11%.

Current polling trends: As of July 5, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points. This is within the range we're looking at for July 15. 2. Time frame: We're looking at a forecast 10 days into the future from the last known data point. In political polling, this is a relatively short time, and dramatic shifts are less likely. 3. Historical volatility: Presidential polling averages tend to fluctuate, but usually within a limited range, especially this close to an election. 4. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points, which means small changes could easily occur. 5. Campaign events: Any major events or scandals in the 10-day period could influence the polls, but their impact might be limited in such a short timeframe. 6.

Incumbency advantage: Historically, incumbent presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless faced with significant challenges or health issues. Biden is the incumbent, which typically favors running for re-election. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There have been ongoing discussions about his age and fitness for office, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current political climate: As of July 2024, Biden's approval ratings and the overall political landscape will play a crucial role in his decision. If his popularity is low or if there are significant challenges facing the country, it might influence his choice. 4. Party support: The Democratic Party's stance and potential alternative candidates will be important factors. If there's strong support for Biden within the party, it's less likely he would step aside. 5. Personal factors: Biden's own desire to continue serving as president and his family's input will be significant in his decision-making process. 6. Timing: The question specifies a deadline of July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's more common for such decisions to be made earlier in the election cycle. 7. Current indications: As of now (July 2024), Biden has not given any strong indications that he plans to step aside. He has been actively campaigning and fundraising for his re-election bid. 8. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to decline their party's nomination this late in the election cycle. The last time this happened was with Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, under very different circumstances. Considering all these factors, it seems unlikely that Biden would make such an announcement before July 15, 2024.

As of now (July 2023), it's still early in the election cycle, and polling averages can fluctuate significantly. However, recent polls have shown Trump and Biden in a close race, with some polls giving Trump a slight lead. Given the current political climate and historical trends, it's possible but not highly likely that Trump could have a lead in this specific range.

Condition B: Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President. Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election and has begun his campaign.

For Biden to reverse course and decline the nomination would be a major political upheaval. Such a decision is possible but quite unlikely.

Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in several states to remove Trump from the ballot using this argument. Colorado and Maine have already made decisions to remove Trump from their primary ballots, citing the 14th Amendment. 3. Supreme Court involvement: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case regarding Trump's disqualification from Colorado's ballot. Their decision will likely have a significant impact on other states' actions. 4. Timeline: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is after most primary elections will have taken place.

The probability of a sitting president not completing their term is historically low. Unless there's an unforeseen health crisis or a major political scandal, it's highly likely Biden will remain President through July 2024. b) Trump being removed or blocked from primary ballots under the 14th Amendment: This is a more complex and uncertain situation. There have been discussions and some legal attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running for office due to his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot.

There have been discussions about potential protectionist measures. The European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs in October 2023, which is expected to conclude by November 2024. However, the timeline for announcing tariffs by July 5, 2024, seems quite tight, given that the investigation is still ongoing and such decisions typically involve lengthy processes and negotiations. The EU might be cautious about imposing tariffs due to potential retaliation from China and the impact on global trade relations.

Part B: At least 5 Dem House Members/Senators urging Biden to drop out by July 20, 2024. Biden's age and perceived cognitive decline have been ongoing concerns within the Democratic Party. His approval ratings have been consistently low, which might worry some Democrats about his chances in the 2024 election. However, it's rare for sitting presidents to face significant intra-party challenges, especially this close to the election. Most Democratic leaders have publicly supported Biden's re-election bid, and there hasn't been a coordinated effort to push him out so far.

Party dynamics: The Republican Party has largely embraced Trump's policies and style, which Cheney has openly opposed. This makes it very difficult for her to gain widespread support among Republican primary voters. 7. Time until convention: While there is still time until the 2024 convention, it would require a massive shift in Republican voter sentiment for Cheney to become a frontrunner. Given these factors, it appears highly unlikely that Liz Cheney will be selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. It's relatively rare for an incumbent president to decide not to seek re-election, especially after already announcing their intention to run.

Given Biden's current stance and the historical precedent of incumbents running for re-election, the probability of this scenario is low.

For Harris to become president, either President Biden would need to resign, be removed from office, or become incapacitated. While Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history, he appears to be in relatively good health and has shown no indication of stepping down. Impeachment or removal via the 25th Amendment seems unlikely given the current political landscape. 2. A member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024: This is more likely, primarily due to Donald Trump's continued influence in the Republican Party. As of now, Trump is leading in most polls for the Republican nomination. While he faces legal challenges and competition from other candidates, his base remains strong. The other Trump family members mentioned have not shown serious interest in running, making their nominations highly unlikely. Considering these factors: - The probability of Harris becoming president by the given date is low, estimated at around 5%. - The probability of a Trump family member (primarily Donald Trump) being the Republican nominee is much higher, estimated at around 60-70%.

Men's 100m dash breaking the Olympic record: The current Olympic record for men's 100m dash is 9.63 seconds, set by Usain Bolt in 2012. Breaking this record is extremely challenging. While sprinting technology and training methods continue to improve, Bolt's record has stood for over a decade. The world record (9.58s, also by Bolt) hasn't been broken since 2009. Given the rarity of such exceptional performances, I'd estimate the probability of breaking the Olympic record at around 15%. 2. Individual Neutral Athletes winning \u226515 gold medals: \"Individual Neutral Athletes\" typically refers to athletes from countries that are banned from competing under their national flag, often due to doping violations. In recent years, this has primarily applied to Russian athletes. At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (held in 2021), the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) won 20 gold medals.

However, they've been trying to improve their selection methods in recent years. 4. Competition: The level of competition in Eurovision has been increasing, with many countries investing more in their entries. This makes qualification more challenging for all participants. 5. Voting patterns: Latvia often receives support from its Baltic neighbors and Nordic countries, but this hasn't been enough to secure qualification in recent years. 6. Potential for improvement: Given their recent string of non-qualifications, Latvia may be motivated to make significant changes to their approach for 2024, which could improve their chances. 7. Random factors: The semi-final draw, running order, and the specific mix of countries in their semi-final can all affect their chances of qualification. Considering these factors, Latvia's chances of qualifying are not particularly high based on recent history. However, Eurovision results can be unpredictable, and with potential renewed efforts, they could break their non-qualification streak. Their historical qualification rate of 43% suggests they're not entirely out of contention, but recent trends weigh against them. Given the balance of these factors, I would estimate their chances of qualification as slightly below their historical average, but not drastically so given the potential for improvement and the inherent unpredictability of the contest."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "89d4c31a-2612-44c4-b176-c810e8ce53c9", "title": "Will Australia qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Australia participates in a Semi-final and is then officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024, and there have been no significant indications that he plans to replace Harris as his running mate. While there have been some criticisms of Harris's performance, replacing her could be seen as a sign of weakness or disunity within the Democratic Party.

Recent Olympic performances: In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), Caeleb Dressel (USA) won 5 gold medals in swimming, tying for the most gold medals with Emma McKeon (AUS), also a swimmer. In 2016 Rio Olympics, Michael Phelps won 5 gold medals, the most of any athlete. 3. Current swimming stars: While Michael Phelps has retired, there are still dominant swimmers like Caeleb Dressel, Katie Ledecky (USA), and Ariarne Titmus (AUS) who have the potential to win multiple gold medals. 4. Competition from other sports: The main competition for most gold medals often comes from gymnastics, athletics (track and field), and sometimes cycling. However, these sports typically offer fewer opportunities for a single athlete to win multiple golds compared to swimming. 5. Time until the Olympics: The question was created about a month before the Olympics. This proximity to the event means that current form and recent performances of athletes are likely to be good indicators of Olympic success. 6.

Apple, while still growing, has been doing so at a slower pace. 3. Industry dynamics: Nvidia is at the forefront of the AI revolution, which is expected to continue growing. Apple, while a tech giant, is more focused on consumer electronics and services, which may not have the same explosive growth potential in the near term. 4.

Economic factors: The overall economic environment, including factors like interest rates, inflation, and global economic conditions, could impact both companies differently. 6. Product cycles: Both companies' performance could be influenced by new product releases or innovations. Nvidia might benefit from new AI-related products, while Apple could see boosts from new iPhone models or other innovations. 7.

Given these factors, while Nvidia has shown impressive growth and is in a booming sector, overtaking Apple's market cap in just one year seems unlikely.

Competition: The Republican field for 2024 is likely to be crowded. Former President Donald Trump has already announced his candidacy, and other high-profile Republicans like Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, and Nikki Haley are potential contenders. These candidates have more national recognition and established support bases. 3. Polling: As of now, Youngkin does not feature prominently in national polls for the 2024 Republican nomination. He's often not even included in many polls, which suggests he's not considered a top-tier candidate by pollsters. 4. Fundraising and support: There's little evidence so far of a strong national fundraising operation or widespread party support for a Youngkin candidacy. 5. Timing: Youngkin was elected governor in 2021, and his term runs until 2026. Running for president in 2024 would mean abandoning his governorship early, which could be seen negatively by some voters. 6. Public statements: Youngkin has not explicitly ruled out a run, but he has also not taken clear steps towards launching a campaign. He's focused on his role as governor and building his profile through involvement in other Republican campaigns. 7. Party dynamics: The Republican Party is currently divided between Trump loyalists and those seeking a new direction. Youngkin's position in this divide is not clearly established, which could make it difficult for him to build a broad coalition. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Youngkin to become the nominee, it seems highly unlikely at this point.

This factor significantly boosts France's chances. 2. Recent Olympic performance: In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), France finished 8th in the medal table with 33 total medals (10 gold, 12 silver, 11 bronze). This shows that France is already a strong contender on the global stage. 3.

In the 2016 Rio Olympics, they finished 7th, and in the 2012 London Olympics, they were 7th as well. 5.

However, winning an Olympic gold medal is extremely challenging due to fierce competition. While she has shown great potential, she faced a setback in 2021 when she was unable to compete in the Tokyo Olympics due to a suspension. Her current form and consistency will be crucial factors. Given the unpredictable nature of sprinting events and the high level of competition, I'd estimate her chances of winning gold at around 30-35%. b) France placing in the Top 5: As the host nation, France will likely benefit from home advantage and increased investment in their Olympic program. In recent Summer Olympics, France has consistently performed well: - 2020 Tokyo: 8th place - 2016 Rio: 7th place - 2012 London: 7th place While they haven't cracked the top 5 recently, being the host nation could provide the boost needed to achieve this goal. Host nations often see an improvement in their medal tallies. Additionally, France has a strong sporting culture and has been investing in their Olympic program. I'd estimate their chances of finishing in the top 5 at around 50-55%. Combining these probabilities, we need to consider that only one of these events needs to occur for the question to resolve YES.

Barring a major health crisis or unforeseen scandal, it's highly unlikely he would drop out, especially this close to the election. 2. Kamala Harris picking either Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro as her VP: This scenario would only come into play if Biden were to drop out, making Harris the presumptive nominee. Even in that unlikely event, the probability of her choosing either Kelly or Shapiro is low. While both are prominent Democrats, there are many other potential VP candidates she might consider. Moreover, the timeframe given (before August 7th) is quite short for making such a crucial decision if Biden were to unexpectedly drop out. Given that this question resolves to YES if either of these unlikely events occurs, we need to consider their combined probability. However, since the first event (Biden dropping out) is a prerequisite for the second event (Harris choosing a specific VP), and the first event is already highly improbable, the overall probability remains very low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Potential last-minute challengers: There's always a small chance that a prominent Democrat could launch a late primary challenge, which might necessitate a debate. 2. Party pressure: If there are significant concerns about Biden's candidacy, the party might organize a debate to address these issues or showcase potential alternatives.

Let's analyze each separately: (a) Another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Convention: The 2024 Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22, 2024. As of now (July 2024), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party. Typically, incumbent presidents do not participate in primary debates. However, there have been concerns about Biden's age and some calls for alternative candidates. Despite this, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has not scheduled any debates, and it's unlikely they would do so this late in the process without a significant change in circumstances. The probability of this occurring is low, perhaps around 10-15%. (b) Kamala Harris becomes President or Acting President by July 26, 2024: This would require a scenario where President Biden is unable to fulfill his duties, either temporarily or permanently. While Biden is the oldest serving president in U.S. history, there have been no indications of imminent health issues that would necessitate this transfer of power. The 25th Amendment allows for a temporary transfer of power, which has been used occasionally for planned medical procedures. However, the timeframe for this event is relatively short (less than a month from the creation date of this question). The probability of this occurring is also low, perhaps around 5-10%. Combining these probabilities, we need to consider the chance of either event occurring. Since they are independent events, we can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Let's use the higher end of our estimates: P(A) = 0.15, P(B) = 0.10, P(A and B) \u2248 0 (the probability of both events occurring is negligible). P(A or B) = 0.15 + 0.10 - 0 = 0.25.

However, concerns about his age and health persist, which could potentially lead to a dropout scenario. 2.

As of now, Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee. Traditionally, incumbent presidents rarely face primary challengers, and when they do, debates are uncommon. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has also shown strong support for Biden's re-election bid. Given these factors, the probability of a debate occurring is low, perhaps around 10-15%. (b) A reliable media outlet covers Joe Biden's dropout 6 hours in advance: This scenario is even less likely. While there has been some speculation about Biden's age and fitness for office, he has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. His campaign is actively fundraising and preparing for the general election.

Biden is a known quantity, while a generic Democrat might be perceived as potentially more moderate or appealing to swing voters. The timeframe (by July 6) is relatively short, which limits the potential for major shifts in public opinion. I'd estimate this part has about a 30% chance of occurring. 2. Trump testifying at the hush money trial: This scenario is less likely. Typically, defendants in high-profile cases, especially former presidents, are advised by their legal teams not to testify due to the risks involved. Trump is known for his unpredictable behavior, but he has generally followed legal advice in his previous trials. The potential downsides of testifying (such as perjury risks or damaging cross-examination) outweigh the potential benefits. I'd estimate this part has about a 15% chance of occurring.

Current economic conditions: As of mid-2023, inflation has been moderating but remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Fed has been implementing tight monetary policy to bring inflation down. 3. Time frame: The question is about July 2024, which is about a year from now. This gives time for current policies to take effect, but also allows for potential new economic developments. 4. Seasonal factors: July typically doesn't have strong seasonal effects on Core CPI, so this shouldn't be a major factor. 5. Federal Reserve projections: The Fed's latest projections (as of June 2023) show inflation gradually declining but still above 2% by the end of 2024. 6. Economic recovery and potential shocks: By July 2024, we might see a more robust economic recovery, which could put upward pressure on prices. However, there's also the possibility of economic shocks or a recession, which could dampen inflation. 7. Base effects: If inflation continues to moderate throughout 2023 and early 2024, the bar for a 0.1% increase becomes lower, making it more likely to occur. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that the Core CPI will increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024 compared to June 2024. While inflation is expected to moderate, it's still projected to be above the Fed's target by that time. A 0.1% increase is a relatively low bar, and even in periods of low inflation, we often see monthly increases above this level.

While President Biden is the oldest sitting president and concerns about his age and health have been raised, there's no concrete evidence suggesting he's unable to discharge his duties. For this to happen, it would require a significant and sudden decline in his health or mental capacity, as well as agreement from the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet. Considering these factors: - The probability of a 0.1% or greater increase in Core CPI is relatively high, perhaps around 70-80%. - The probability of Biden being declared incapacitated is very low, perhaps less than 1%. Since we only need one of these events to occur for the question to resolve as YES, we can use the principle of addition of probabilities. However, these events are independent, so we don't need to worry about overlap. The combined probability would be slightly higher than the probability of the CPI increase alone."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.020672715843815442, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.006890905281271814, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.20368728560688704, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Joe Biden dropping out before July 13: Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. While there are concerns about his age and some Democrats have expressed a desire for a new candidate, there are several factors to consider: - Biden is the incumbent president, which gives him a significant advantage. - He has not shown any signs of wanting to step down. - The Democratic Party leadership largely supports his re-election bid. - July 13 is relatively soon, leaving little time for a major change in plans. The probability of Biden dropping out before July 13 is also quite low, perhaps around 5-10%. Combining these probabilities, we need to calculate the chance of at least one of these events occurring.

The current UK government, led by the Conservative Party, has consistently opposed a second Scottish independence referendum. The Supreme Court ruled in November 2022 that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate for a referendum without Westminster's consent.

Trump's involvement in January 6th: The events of January 6th, 2021, and Trump's role in them are central to arguments for his disqualification under the 14th Amendment.

Legal challenges: Any attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would likely face immediate and vigorous legal challenges, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. 5.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. It would be highly unusual for an incumbent president to withdraw from seeking re-nomination, especially this late in the process. However, unforeseen health issues or a significant political scandal could potentially change this. The probability of this occurring is quite low, perhaps around 5-10%. 2.

As of now (April 2024), it's under Ukrainian control but has been a target of Russian forces. The war in Ukraine has been ongoing for over two years, and the frontlines have been relatively static for some time. While Russia has shown renewed offensive capabilities, taking control of Chasiv Yar would require a significant breakthrough. Given the time frame (about 5 weeks from now to June 1, 2024) and the current situation, this seems unlikely but not impossible. The probability might be around 15-20%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either of these events occurs. To calculate the probability of at least one of these independent events occurring, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

If there were signs of Biden considering dropping out, these outlets would be highly motivated to report on it as soon as possible. 3. White House information control: The Biden administration would likely try to control the narrative around such a significant decision. However, leaks from insiders are not uncommon in Washington. 4. Time frame: The question specifies at least 6 hours of advance coverage. This is a relatively short time frame in political news cycles, making it more likely for news to break within this window. 5.

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance that if Biden were to drop out, a major news outlet would report it at least 6 hours in advance. The competitive nature of news media, the significance of such an event, and the likelihood of leaks from insiders all contribute to this assessment.

Unpredictability: Shyamalan's films are known for being unpredictable, which can lead to varied audience reactions. 6. Time since last release: With 'Trap' coming out in 2024, there's a possibility that Shyamalan has taken audience feedback from his recent films into account, potentially improving the reception. Given these factors, I believe there's a chance for improvement over his last two films, but the downward trend and recent low scores are concerning. The positive trailer reception provides some hope for a better audience response.

Part A: 'Deadpool & Wolverine' box office opening - 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is a highly anticipated film combining two popular Marvel characters. The previous Deadpool movies were very successful, with Deadpool 2 opening at $125.5 million. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) typically draws large audiences. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are both major stars with strong fan bases. The target of $185.5 million is high but not unreachable for a big Marvel movie. However, recent superhero movies have underperformed at the box office. Given these factors, I'd estimate a 60% chance of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' surpassing the $185.5 million opening weekend target. Part B: 'Trap' (2024) CinemaScore - 'Trap' is a lesser-known film with less available information. CinemaScore grades are based on audience reception, not critical reviews. A grade of B or above is relatively common for most films. Without more information about the film's genre, stars, or marketing, it's hard to make a precise prediction. There's also a chance the film might not receive a CinemaScore at all. Given the limited information and the general tendency for films to receive B or above, I'd estimate a 70% chance of 'Trap' receiving a B CinemaScore or higher, if it receives a score at all.

Apple, while still growing, has been doing so at a slower pace. 3. Industry dynamics: Nvidia is at the forefront of the AI revolution, which is expected to continue growing. Apple, while strong in consumer electronics, faces a more mature market with slower growth potential. 4. Time frame: The question is about July 17, 2024, which is less than a year away. This is a relatively short time for such a significant market cap shift to occur. 5. Market volatility: Tech stocks can be volatile, and unforeseen events could significantly impact either company's valuation. 6. Competition and innovation: Both companies face competition and need to continue innovating to maintain their market positions. Given these factors, while Nvidia has shown impressive growth and is in a rapidly expanding sector, it seems unlikely that it will surpass Apple's market cap by July 2024. The gap between their market caps is still very large, and less than a year is a short time for such a dramatic shift. However, Nvidia's strong position in AI does give it a non-trivial chance of achieving this feat if its growth continues to accelerate while Apple faces challenges."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "c3c65acb-cf04-4501-ab03-019124a7935e", "title": "Will Donald Trump be removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if, *on* July 15, 2024:\n\nDonald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe removal or block is confirmed through official state government announcements, court decisions, legal documentation, or credible media reports.

Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in several states to remove Trump from the ballot using this argument. Colorado and Maine have already made decisions to remove Trump from their primary ballots, citing the 14th Amendment. 3.

This is within the range we're looking for (between 2 and 3 points), but we need to consider potential changes over the next 10 days. 2. Time frame: The period between July 5 and July 15 is relatively short in political terms. Major shifts in polling are less likely to occur in such a brief period unless there are significant events. 3. Historical volatility: Presidential polls tend to fluctuate, but usually within a certain range. A change of 0.6 points in either direction over 10 days is not uncommon. 4.

However, there's also a significant chance it could fall below 2 or rise above 3. The probability of the lead staying within this narrow range is higher than it falling outside of it, but not overwhelmingly so.

For this to happen, there would need to be a severe decline in Biden's health or mental capacity, significant enough that the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet deem him unable to discharge his duties. While Biden is the oldest serving president and there have been concerns about his age and occasional gaffes, there's no concrete evidence of a severe decline that would warrant such an extreme measure. The administration and Democratic Party would likely resist such a move due to its political implications unless absolutely necessary. (b) Joe Biden dies before August 2024: Biden is currently 80 years old (born November 20, 1942). While advanced age does increase mortality risk, Biden has access to excellent healthcare and regular medical check-ups. His most recent physical exam in February 2023 declared him 'fit for duty.' However, the mortality rate for men in their early 80s is not negligible. According to actuarial tables, the one-year mortality rate for an 80-year-old man is approximately 5.6%.

The goal is to have it ready for consideration at the 77th World Health Assembly in May 2024. However, international agreements of this magnitude are often complex and can face challenges in reaching consensus. Given the global importance of pandemic preparedness, there's significant motivation to approve the agreement, but potential disagreements on specific terms could delay the process. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%. 2. OpenAI committing to 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle: OpenAI has been under increasing scrutiny regarding AI safety and ethics. The 'righttowarn.ai' initiative highlights the importance of allowing researchers and employees to disclose potential risks without fear of retaliation. Given the growing pressure on AI companies to demonstrate responsible development practices, it's plausible that OpenAI might make such a commitment. However, the specific requirements (new level of commitment, verification by Metaculus, satisfaction of righttowarn.ai members) make this a more stringent condition. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 40%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of either of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.60 + 0.40 - (0.60 * 0.40) = 0.76.

This recent success suggests they are still competitive and capable of producing entries that resonate with both juries and televotes. 3. Eurovision popularity: Norway is generally well-regarded in Eurovision, with a passionate fan base and a history of sending diverse and interesting entries. This goodwill can sometimes translate into votes. 4. Selection process: Norway typically uses the Melodi Grand Prix to select their entry, which often results in high-quality songs that are well-received by the Eurovision audience. 5. Scandinavian voting bloc: While not as strong as some other regional voting blocs, there is often some support between Scandinavian countries, which can help secure some points. 6. Unpredictability factor: Eurovision results can be unpredictable, and factors like running order, staging, and performance on the night can significantly impact results. 7. Time until the event: As of the question creation date (April 12, 2024), there's still about a month until Eurovision 2024. Norway's entry may not be fully known or rehearsed yet, which adds some uncertainty. Given Norway's strong track record, recent success, and generally competitive entries, they have a good chance of qualifying for the Grand Final. However, it's not a certainty due to the inherent unpredictability of the contest and the high level of competition. Considering all these factors, I would estimate a high probability of Norway qualifying for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "3285122a-337e-4a29-9bee-53c8d5f1ca5a", "title": "Will Switzerland qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Switzerland participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There are concerns about his age and cognitive abilities, which could potentially lead to a decision not to run. 3. Current statements and actions: As of now (July 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has already launched his 2024 campaign. 4.

Given that Manifold is a prediction market platform, its users might be more informed or have different political leanings compared to the general public. 2.

This suggests that Trump might gain support when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat. 3. Biden's current popularity: As of 2023, Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, which could contribute to Trump gaining more support when facing Biden specifically. 4. Time factor: The polls close on July 6, 2024, which is about a year from now. A lot can change in politics during this time, potentially affecting the results. 5. Manifold community characteristics: Without specific data on the Manifold community's political leanings, it's hard to predict how they might differ from the general public. 6.

Donald Trump Jr. has not announced any intention to run for president, and he lacks the political experience and broader appeal that would be necessary to secure the nomination. While he is popular among his father's base, he doesn't have the same level of support across the Republican party. 2. Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat: This scenario is more plausible. Donald Trump has a strong and dedicated base, and he tends to perform better in head-to-head matchups against specific opponents rather than against a generic candidate. Joe Biden, as the incumbent president, has faced various challenges during his term, which could potentially make him a less favorable opponent compared to a generic Democrat. However, a 3% difference is quite significant. While Trump might perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat, a full 3% swing is a high bar to clear. Additionally, by July 6, 2024, the political landscape could change significantly, potentially affecting Trump's standing.

While his age and approval ratings have been topics of discussion, there's no strong indication that he plans to step aside. The Democratic Party has also rallied behind him as the incumbent. The timeframe given (before July 15, 2024) is relatively short, which further reduces the likelihood of such a dramatic change. Probability for (a): Approximately 0.05 (5%) (b) Another Democratic party presidential debate occurring: This scenario is also unlikely, but slightly more possible than (a). Typically, when an incumbent president is running for re-election, their party doesn't hold primary debates. However, if there were significant challenges to Biden's candidacy or if he were to step down, debates could occur. Given the current political landscape and Biden's status as the presumptive nominee, the chances of a debate are low. Probability for (b): Approximately 0.10 (10%) Combining probabilities: Since the question resolves YES if either (a) or (b) occurs, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of these events happening. The probability of neither event occurring is (1 - 0.05) * (1 - 0.10) = 0.855. Therefore, the probability of at least one event occurring is 1 - 0.855 = 0.145. Probability: 0.145 This means there's about a 14.5% chance that either Biden will announce he's not accepting the nomination before July 15, 2024, or there will be another Democratic party presidential debate."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.09594577397933526, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

These factors have contributed to increased market volatility. 3. Future expectations: By July 2024, some of the current economic pressures may have eased. Central banks might have successfully controlled inflation, and the economy could be on a more stable footing. 4. Long-term trends: Volatility tends to revert to the mean over time. If volatility is currently high, it's more likely to decrease in the future. 5. Unpredictable events: Geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or other unforeseen events could cause volatility to spike at any time. 6. Seasonal factors: July is typically a less volatile month due to lower trading volumes during the summer holiday season. 7.

It's difficult to predict with certainty, as it depends on various economic factors, geopolitical events, and market sentiment.

Despite these obstacles, his chances of securing the nomination are still quite high. Let's estimate this probability at around 60%. Now, to calculate the overall probability of either event occurring, we need to use the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) = 0.40 + 0.60 - (0.40 * 0.60) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76 or 76%.

Given these factors, I believe that while it's possible for Russia to take control of Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024, it's not highly probable. The Ukrainian forces have shown resilience in defending key positions, and taking Chasiv Yar would require a significant Russian offensive push, which they haven't demonstrated the capability for recently. However, the extended timeframe does provide an opportunity for Russia to regroup, resupply, and potentially launch new offensives.

Russia's control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024: Chasiv Yar is a strategically important town in eastern Ukraine, close to Bakhmut. As of now (2023), it's under Ukrainian control, but Russia has been trying to advance in this area. However, predicting the state of the conflict more than 8 months into the future is challenging. The Ukrainian counteroffensive has made some progress, but the conflict remains fluid.

Donald Trump being removed or blocked from primary election ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This is a contentious legal and political issue. Several states have considered or are considering this action, with Colorado and Maine already moving to bar Trump from their primary ballots. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear Trump's appeal against Colorado's decision, which will likely set a precedent for other states. Given the Supreme Court's conservative majority and the complexity of the legal issues involved, there's a significant chance that Trump will ultimately be allowed on the ballots. However, the possibility of at least one state maintaining a ban by July 15, 2024, is not negligible. I'd estimate a 25% chance of this condition being met.

(a) Regarding 'House of the Dragon' S2E7 rating: The show has a strong fan base and generally receives high ratings. However, achieving a rating above 8.5 is quite challenging, especially just two days after release when ratings can be more volatile. Looking at the current IMDB ratings for the show (which aren't provided in the question but I assume are generally high), we can estimate that while it's possible to achieve >8.5, it's not highly probable. The market closing 90 minutes after the episode premieres suggests that early reactions will be crucial. Given the strict inequality (>8.5), even a rating of exactly 8.5 would result in a NO. I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 0.3 or 30%. (b) Regarding the linked market reaching 377 traders by July 15: Without access to the current number of traders or historical data on trader growth for this market, it's difficult to make a precise estimate. The market has about 11 days to reach the target (from the creation date to July 15). 377 traders is a specific and somewhat large number, suggesting it might be based on some existing trend or benchmark. Manifold Markets can sometimes see rapid growth in popular or interesting markets. Given the limited information, I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 0.4 or 40%.

This ongoing investigation increases the likelihood of potential arrest warrants. 2. Recent events: The conflict between Israel and Hamas that erupted in October 2023 has led to increased international scrutiny of Israel's actions in Gaza. This heightened attention could accelerate the ICC's investigation process. 3. Political pressure: There is growing international pressure on Israel regarding its conduct in the conflict, which could influence the ICC's decision-making process. 4. Precedent: The ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state and high-ranking officials in other countries, demonstrating its willingness to take such actions. 5. Time frame: The question allows for approximately 17 months from the creation date to the resolution date, which is a significant amount of time for the ICC to conduct its investigation and potentially issue warrants. 6. Israeli cooperation: Israel is not a member of the ICC and has rejected its jurisdiction. This lack of cooperation could slow down the investigation process but may also increase the likelihood of arrest warrants being issued. 7. Complexity of the case: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is highly complex, and gathering evidence and building a case strong enough to justify arrest warrants may take considerable time. 8. International diplomatic considerations: Issuing arrest warrants for high-ranking Israeli officials could have significant diplomatic repercussions, which the ICC may take into account. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate likelihood that the ICC will issue arrest warrants for at least one of the listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024. The ongoing investigation, recent events, and international pressure increase the chances, while the complexity of the case and potential diplomatic consequences may slow the process.

(a) ICC issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders: The ICC has been investigating alleged war crimes in Palestinian territories since 2021. The ongoing conflict in Gaza has intensified international scrutiny of Israel's actions. However, issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli officials is a significant step that would face substantial political pressure and potential backlash. Factors to consider: 1. The ICC moves slowly and carefully in such high-profile cases. 2. Israel is not a member of the ICC, which complicates the process. 3. There's growing international concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza. 4. The US and other allies might exert pressure to prevent such warrants.

While it's possible that Trump might testify, it's not highly likely.

Without specific information about such events, we should assume relative stability. 5. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points, which means small fluctuations are common and not necessarily indicative of real changes in voter preference. 6. 538's methodology: 538 uses a weighted average of multiple polls, which tends to smooth out short-term fluctuations and extreme results from individual polls. Given these factors, it seems reasonably likely that Trump's lead will remain within the specified range. The current lead of 2.4 points is already within this range, and significant changes in either direction within a 10-day period are less common without major events.

Election cycle: As we approach the 2024 presidential election, Biden (assuming he runs for re-election) will likely increase his media presence to reach voters. Long-form interviews can be an effective way to communicate his message and connect with the electorate. 4. Campaign strategy: Biden's team may see value in scheduling longer interviews to allow for more in-depth discussions on policy issues and to counter any narratives about his ability to handle lengthy conversations. 5. Media interest: Given Biden's position as the incumbent president and potential candidate for re-election, there will likely be significant media interest in securing long-form interviews with him. 6. Biden's preferences: While Biden has done some longer interviews in the past, the question suggests that many of his recent appearances have been shorter. This could indicate a preference for briefer engagements. 7. Scheduling constraints: As president, Biden has a busy schedule, which might make it challenging to allocate time for extended interviews. 8. Health and stamina considerations: There may be concerns about Biden's ability to maintain focus and energy for extended periods, given his age and occasional public gaffes. Considering these factors, I believe it is more likely than not that Biden will participate in at least one 45+ minute in-person interview before the end of July 2024.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average: As of July 5, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points. The question asks if this lead will be between 2 and 3 points (exclusive of 2, inclusive of 3) on July 15, 2024. Given that there's only a 10-day gap between the current data point and the target date, it's plausible that the lead could remain within this narrow range. However, polling averages can be volatile, especially in a close race. The probability of hitting this exact range is relatively low, but not negligible. I'd estimate this at about 20-25%. (b) Joe Biden having an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes: This part seems more likely to occur. Biden has done long-form interviews before, such as the 70-minute Howard Stern interview in April. However, such lengthy interviews are not frequent occurrences for Biden. The question gives us until the end of July 2024, which is about three weeks from the date mentioned in part (a). Given that it's an election year and Biden might want to reach out to voters through various media channels, there's a decent chance he might do a long-form interview. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 40-45%. Combining the probabilities: For the overall question to resolve as YES, either (a) or (b) needs to occur.

Part A: Tim Scott being the Republican nominee Tim Scott is currently a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, he is considered a long-shot candidate compared to frontrunners like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. Scott's polling numbers have been consistently low, and he lacks the national recognition and fundraising power of the leading candidates. Given the current political landscape and the strong support for Trump among Republican voters, the probability of Scott securing the nomination is very low, perhaps around 1-2%. Part B: 538 projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024 This part is more challenging to predict as it's still over a year away. Several factors to consider: 1. Incumbent advantage: Biden is the sitting president, which typically provides an advantage. 2. Economic factors: The state of the economy in mid-2024 will significantly influence voter sentiment. 3. Approval ratings: Biden's current approval ratings are low, but these can change over time. 4. Republican nominee: The strength of Biden's opponent will affect his chances. 5. FiveThirtyEight's methodology: Their forecasts tend to be cautious and account for uncertainty. Given these factors, it's reasonable to assume that the race will be competitive. However, considering the incumbent advantage and the possibility of economic improvements, there's a moderate chance that Biden could be favored by FiveThirtyEight on the specified date.

Short timeframe: The question was created very close to the resolution date (about a week before), which suggests that the tennis events are about to begin or have already started. This proximity to the event provides more certainty about participants and their current form. 6.

The multiple event formats, the tendency for top players to compete in more than one event, and the historical precedent all point towards a high probability of this occurring. However, we must also consider potential factors that could prevent this: - Upsets are possible in tennis, especially in a high-pressure environment like the Olympics. - Injuries or fatigue could prevent a player from performing consistently across multiple events. - The field may be more competitive than in previous years, making it harder for any single player to dominate.

Anti-Trump stance: While this could appeal to some Republicans looking for an alternative, it might alienate a significant portion of the Republican base that still strongly supports Trump. 5. Fundraising and support: Christie would need to significantly increase his fundraising and support base to become a viable candidate. 6. Time until the convention: There is still considerable time until the Republican National Convention, which allows for potential shifts in the political landscape. 7. Potential for a brokered convention: If no candidate secures a majority of delegates, there could be a brokered convention, which might open opportunities for alternative candidates. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Chris Christie will become the Republican nominee.

He has officially announced his re-election campaign and has the support of the Democratic Party establishment. 2.

However, this is more than a year before the date in question, so a lot can change. 2. Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents often face challenges in their re-election bids, especially if the economy is struggling or there are other significant issues. Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, which could work in Trump's favor. 3. Economic factors: The state of the economy in mid-2024 will likely play a crucial role in voter preferences. If there's a recession or continued high inflation, it could hurt Biden's chances. 4. Legal issues: Trump is facing several legal challenges. The outcomes of these cases could significantly impact his standing with voters. 5. Campaign effectiveness: Both candidates' ability to run effective campaigns and perform well in debates will influence polling numbers. 6. International events: Major international crises or conflicts could sway public opinion towards either candidate, depending on how they're perceived to handle the situations. 7.

However, the current government has been in place since May 2022. 3.

Given these factors, it seems likely that the Prime Minister will still belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024. The main reasons for this are: - The current Prime Minister is from the Together coalition. - President Macron, who appoints the Prime Minister, is aligned with Together and will still be in office. - There are no scheduled elections that would force a change. - The coalition, while facing challenges, has maintained its position.

(a) The Republican Party of France forming a political alliance with the National Rally: This scenario seems highly unlikely. The Republican Party (Les R\u00e9publicains) is a center-right party, while the National Rally (Rassemblement National) is a far-right party. Historically, these parties have had significant ideological differences and have not shown any inclination towards forming alliances. The Republican Party has traditionally aligned with more moderate parties to distance itself from the far-right. Moreover, such an alliance could potentially alienate a significant portion of the Republican Party's voter base. Given the short timeframe (by July 30, 2024) and the lack of any current indications of such a move, this scenario appears very improbable. (b) The Prime Minister of France belonging to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024: This scenario is more likely. The Together coalition (Ensemble) is currently in power, with Elisabeth Borne serving as the Prime Minister. However, it's important to note that the French political landscape is quite volatile, and changes in government can occur relatively quickly. The next legislative elections are not scheduled until 2027, but political crises or reshuffles could lead to changes in the premiership before then. Given that the Together coalition is currently in power and has a significant presence in the National Assembly, there's a reasonable chance that they will still hold the position of Prime Minister by July 30, 2024. Combining these scenarios: While the first scenario (a) is highly unlikely, the second scenario (b) has a fair chance of occurring. Since only one of these needs to happen for the question to resolve as YES, we should focus more on the probability of (b). Given the current political situation in France, the strength of the Together coalition, and the timeframe involved, I would estimate that there's about a 60% chance that the Prime Minister will still belong to the Together coalition by July 30, 2024.

Current polling trends: As of July 2023, polls show a close race between Trump and Biden, with some polls giving Trump a slight lead. However, we're forecasting more than a year into the future, so current polls have limited predictive power. 2. Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents often face challenges in their re-election bids, especially if the economy is struggling or if there are other significant issues. However, the political landscape has become increasingly polarized, which could lead to more stable polling numbers. 3. Economic factors: The state of the economy in mid-2024 will likely play a crucial role in determining voter preferences. Any significant economic downturn or improvement could sway voters. 4. Political developments: Unforeseen events, scandals, or policy decisions could significantly impact either candidate's standing. 5. Campaign effectiveness: The effectiveness of each candidate's campaign strategy and messaging will influence polling numbers. 6. Demographic shifts: Changes in voter demographics and turnout patterns could affect the polling average. 7. Third-party candidates: The presence and performance of third-party candidates could impact the gap between Trump and Biden. 8. Margin of error: Polls typically have a margin of error, which means small leads are less reliable. Given these factors, it's challenging to predict with high confidence that Trump's lead will fall within such a narrow range (between 3 and 4 points) on a specific date. The question asks for a very precise outcome, which makes it less likely to occur. However, considering the current political climate, the polarization of the electorate, and the possibility of a close race, it's not entirely implausible that Trump could have a lead in this range. A lead of 3-4 points would be significant enough to be outside the typical margin of error for most polls, but not so large as to indicate a landslide victory.

Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party. Historically, incumbent presidents rarely face significant primary challenges, let alone ones that lead to a brokered convention. The last time a major party had a brokered convention was in 1952. Given Biden's strong position within the party and the lack of any serious challengers, it's highly improbable that the Democrats would need multiple rounds of voting to nominate their candidate.\n\n(b) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early:\nThis scenario is more plausible but still unlikely. While there may be some Democrats who have reservations about Biden's candidacy due to factors like his age or approval ratings, publicly opposing the party's presumptive nominee would be a significant and risky political move. It could be seen as divisive and potentially damaging to the party's unity heading into the general election.\n\nMoreover, the timeframe for this to happen is relatively short (by July 21st, 2024), which further reduces the likelihood. Most Democrats, even if they have private concerns, are likely to prioritize party unity over public dissent.\n\nHowever, it's not entirely impossible. If there were to be a major scandal or a significant decline in Biden's health or polling numbers, it could potentially motivate some Democrats to take such action. But as of now, there are no strong indications of such a movement forming.\n\nGiven that only one of these scenarios needs to occur for the question to resolve as YES, we need to consider the combined probability.

(a) A member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024: Currently, Donald Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination in 2024. He has officially announced his candidacy and maintains a strong base of support within the Republican party. While there are other candidates in the race, such as Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, Trump's name recognition, loyal following, and previous presidential experience give him a significant advantage. The other Trump family members listed are much less likely to be the nominee, as they have not shown serious interest in running or lack the political experience to be viable candidates. (b) Facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents: This part is more uncertain, as it depends on specific polls conducted on the Manifold platform. However, we can make some educated guesses based on general polling trends: 1. Joe Biden is a known quantity with both strengths and weaknesses as a candidate. A generic Democrat, on the other hand, allows respondents to project their ideal candidate. 2. Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, which might make him less appealing than a generic Democrat. 3. Trump and Biden have a history of direct competition, which might polarize voters more than a hypothetical matchup with a generic Democrat. Given these factors, it's plausible that Trump could perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat. However, a 3% difference is quite significant and may be challenging to achieve.

Time until convention: The question was created about a month before the proposed resolution date, which is likely close to the convention date. At this late stage, it would be highly unusual for a situation to develop that would lead to a brokered convention. 5. Historical precedent: Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern American politics. The last time Democrats had a truly brokered convention was in 1952. 6. Primary process: The Democratic primary process is designed to produce a clear winner before the convention, with superdelegates no longer voting on the first ballot (a change made after the 2016 election). Given these factors, it is highly unlikely that the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024. The probability of this occurring is very low.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024: As of now (July 2023), it's difficult to predict the exact polling numbers for July 2024. However, we can consider some factors: 1. Historical trends show that presidential races often tighten as the election approaches. 2. The incumbent (Biden) typically has an advantage, but his approval ratings have been low. 3. Trump, despite legal challenges, maintains a strong base of support. 4. Economic conditions and other unforeseen events could significantly impact polling. Given these factors, a Trump lead of 2-4 points is possible but not highly likely.

Biden would likely need to step aside or face significant challenges. 2. No clear alternative candidate would emerge during the primary process. 3. Multiple candidates would need to split the delegates fairly evenly. Given that Biden is the incumbent and has indicated he plans to run, and there's no clear sign of a major challenge within the party, a brokered convention seems unlikely.

In such a short time, significant changes in polling are less likely unless major events occur. 3.

Polling methodology: 538's polling average is generally considered reliable and tends to smooth out short-term fluctuations. 6.

Given that Trump's lead is already within the specified range (2.4 points on July 5), and considering the short time frame, it seems reasonably likely that his lead will remain within this range on July 15. However, there's also a significant chance it could fall below 2 points or rise above 4 points. The current lead being so close to the lower bound (2 points) suggests a higher probability of falling below that threshold than exceeding the upper bound (4 points).

However, current national polls show a close race between Biden and Trump, with Trump often having a slight lead. Given that incumbents typically have an advantage, and considering potential developments over the next year (economic conditions, foreign policy, etc.), it's possible but not certain that Biden could be favored by July 2024. 2.

However, polling averages can fluctuate significantly over time, especially with major events or campaign developments. Factors to consider: - The economy's performance over the next year - Potential legal issues for Trump - Biden's age and perceived fitness for office - International events and their impact on public opinion - Effectiveness of campaign strategies Given the volatility of politics and the long time frame until July 2024, either of these conditions could reasonably occur. However, the question only requires one of these conditions to be met for a \"Yes\" resolution. The dual condition nature of this question increases the likelihood of a \"Yes\" outcome, as it provides two separate paths for resolution.

Fundraising: As a relatively unknown candidate, Suarez would likely struggle to raise the substantial funds needed to run a competitive national campaign. 5. Experience: While Suarez has executive experience as a mayor, he lacks national political experience, which could be seen as a disadvantage by many Republican voters and party officials. 6.

Concerns about his age and fitness for office could potentially lead to calls for him to step aside, but so far, these concerns haven't translated into widespread demands for him to drop out. 3.

While right-wing populist parties have been gaining ground in various European countries, it would be a significant shift for the ID group to become the largest in the European Parliament. Current trends suggest some growth for right-wing parties, but not enough to overtake the larger, more established groups like the European People's Party (EPP) or the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D).

While there is momentum behind the agreement, reaching a consensus among all member states by May 2024 could be challenging. The probability of this occurring seems moderate, perhaps around 50-60%. Combining these probabilities: Since the question resolves as YES if either event occurs, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of these events happening. Using the higher estimates for each event (20% for (a) and 60% for (b)), and accounting for their independence, we can calculate: P(at least one event occurs) = 1 - P(neither event occurs) = 1 - (0.8 * 0.4) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Given the growing emphasis on AI safety and transparency in the tech industry, it's plausible that Meta would conduct external red-teaming for their AI models.

He's often not even included in many polls due to his low recognition. 4. Fundraising: There's limited information about Hurd's fundraising capabilities, which is crucial for a successful campaign. 5. Policy positions: Hurd is positioning himself as a moderate Republican, which might appeal to some voters but could be a disadvantage in Republican primaries that often favor more conservative candidates. 6. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still about a year away, which theoretically gives Hurd time to build recognition and support. However, the primaries and caucuses leading up to the convention will be crucial. 7. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for a relatively unknown candidate to surge to become the nominee, especially in a field with established national figures. 8. Party dynamics: The Republican Party base has shown strong support for Trump-aligned candidates in recent years, which doesn't align well with Hurd's more moderate positioning. Given these factors, the probability of Will Hurd becoming the Republican nominee is very low. While not impossible, it would require an extraordinary series of events and a massive shift in the current political landscape for Hurd to overcome the obstacles he faces."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "35866a7a-129d-4db3-90f2-280a03b0f9e4", "title": "[Metaculus] Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democra...nomination for President?", "body": "Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nResolves the same as the original on Metaculus.\n\n(https://www.metaculus.com/questions/question_embed/25755/?theme=dark)Resolution criteria\n\nThis question will resolve as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.\n\nTo qualify for a Yes resolution, the statement must be unambiguous and conclusive: it should leave no room for the possibility that Biden would accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nIf such a definitive statement is not made prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, this question will resolve as No.\n\nFine print and additional background information can be found on Metaculus.\n\nOnce the original resolves, its resolution will be applied to this market automatically.

Incumbent advantage: Historically, incumbent presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless facing significant challenges or health issues. 2. Biden's age and health: At 80 years old, Biden is already the oldest serving president. By the 2024 election, he would be 82, which raises concerns about his ability to serve another full term. 3. Current statements: As of now (June 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. 4. Democratic Party support: Despite some concerns about his age, the Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden's potential re-election bid. 5. Polling and approval ratings: While Biden's approval ratings have fluctuated, they haven't dropped to levels that would typically force an incumbent to step aside. 6. Lack of strong Democratic alternatives: There isn't a clear successor or challenger within the Democratic Party who could easily step in if Biden were to withdraw. 7. Political climate: The political landscape can change rapidly, but as of now, there's no overwhelming pressure for Biden to step aside. 8. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely for an incumbent to wait this long to announce they're not running. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Biden will announce he's not accepting the nomination before July 15, 2024. While his age is a concern, the lack of a clear alternative, his current statements of intent to run, and the support from his party all suggest he's likely to accept the nomination. However, we can't completely rule out the possibility of unforeseen events, such as a sudden health issue or a major political scandal, that could force Biden to step aside.

Will Hurd being the Republican nominee: Will Hurd is a former U.S. Representative from Texas who has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, he is currently considered a long-shot candidate. The Republican field is crowded with more prominent figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others who have much higher name recognition and support among Republican voters. Hurd's moderate stance on some issues may not resonate with the current Republican base. Given these factors, the probability of Hurd securing the nomination is very low, likely less than 1%. 2. Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination: Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He has already launched his re-election campaign and has the support of the Democratic Party establishment. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden has shown no signs of stepping aside. The deadline for this announcement (July 15, 2024) is very close to the Democratic National Convention, making it highly unlikely that Biden would wait until then to make such a consequential decision. The probability of Biden making such an announcement is also very low, perhaps around 5%. Combining these probabilities: Since either of these events would result in a YES resolution, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of these events occurring. Using the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), and assuming these events are independent: P(Hurd nomination or Biden withdrawal) \u2248 0.01 + 0.05 - (0.01 * 0.05) = 0.0595.

Eurovision rules: As neither country is part of the 'Big Five' (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) or the host country, both Moldova and Australia will need to compete in the Semi-finals to qualify for the Grand Final. 3.

Quality of entries: While we don't know the specific songs or performers for 2024 yet, both countries have generally sent competitive entries in recent years. 5.

Legal precedent: There have been attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates, but it has rarely been successful in modern times. The most notable recent case was the disqualification of Couy Griffin in New Mexico for his involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot. 2. Trump's involvement in the January 6th events: While Trump's role in the events of January 6th, 2021, has been widely discussed and investigated, there hasn't been a definitive legal ruling declaring his actions as an 'insurrection' under the 14th Amendment. 3. State-by-state variations: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently. Some states might be more inclined to attempt to remove Trump from the ballot than others. 4. Ongoing legal challenges: Trump is facing numerous legal challenges, including federal indictments related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. The outcomes of these cases could influence decisions about his eligibility under the 14th Amendment. 5. Time frame: The resolution date is set for July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the general election. Most primary elections will have already taken place by this time, potentially reducing the likelihood of last-minute ballot removals. 6. Political considerations: Removing a major party candidate from the ballot is an extreme measure that could face significant political backlash. Many states might be hesitant to take such a step without clear legal grounds. 7. Potential Supreme Court involvement: If any state does attempt to remove Trump from the ballot, it's likely that the case would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court for a definitive ruling, which could either uphold or overturn such a decision before the resolution date.

This is a relatively short timeframe for implementing new trade policies, but not impossible. 4. Recent precedents: In September 2023, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs. This investigation is expected to conclude by November 2024, which is after the date in question. However, preliminary findings or political pressures could lead to earlier action. 5. Global economic context: The ongoing global economic uncertainties and supply chain issues might make the EU more inclined to protect its domestic industries. 6. Climate goals: The EU has ambitious climate goals, and while tariffs on EVs might seem counterintuitive, they could be justified as a means to protect and develop the European EV industry. 7. Diplomatic considerations: Imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs could strain EU-China relations, which might make the EU hesitant to take such action without substantial evidence of unfair practices. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance that the EU will announce new tariffs or duties on Chinese EVs before July 5, 2024.

(a) Fidesz-KDNP maintaining its EU plurality from Hungary in 2024: Fidesz-KDNP, led by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has been the dominant political force in Hungary for over a decade. They have consistently performed well in European Parliament elections, securing a majority of Hungary's seats in previous elections. However, there are some factors to consider: - Growing opposition and concerns about democratic backsliding in Hungary - Potential for opposition parties to form coalitions - Changing political landscape in Hungary. Despite these challenges, Fidesz-KDNP still maintains a strong base of support and has a well-established political machine. Given their track record and current political landscape, I would estimate the probability of them maintaining their plurality at around 70%. (b) EU announcing new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024: The EU has been increasingly concerned about the influx of Chinese electric vehicles and their potential impact on European automakers. Several factors support the possibility of new tariffs: - Growing trade tensions between the EU and China - Pressure from European automakers to protect their market share - EU's commitment to supporting its own EV industry. However, there are also factors that might delay or prevent such tariffs: - Potential retaliation from China affecting other EU industries - Concerns about increasing EV prices for European consumers - Ongoing trade negotiations and diplomatic considerations. Given these factors and the relatively short timeframe (less than two months from the question's creation date to the resolution date), I would estimate the probability of the EU announcing new tariffs on Chinese EVs before July 5, 2024, at around 40%. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of either of two events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), and assuming the events are independent: P(YES) = 0.70 + 0.40 - (0.70 * 0.40) = 0.82 or 82%.

Projections: Analysts are projecting a global opening weekend of $340-360 million, which is significantly higher than the current record of $284.5 million held by the original Deadpool. 2. Franchise popularity: Both Deadpool and Wolverine are extremely popular characters with established fan bases. Their crossover is likely to generate substantial interest. 3. Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) connection: This film marks Deadpool's entry into the MCU, which could attract a broader audience beyond typical R-rated moviegoers. 4. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman: The star power of these two actors, especially together, is considerable and should drive ticket sales. 5. Increased theater count: The question mentions that this film will likely play in more theaters than the original Deadpool, potentially increasing its reach and revenue. 6. Inflation and ticket prices: Since the original Deadpool's release, ticket prices have generally increased, which could contribute to higher gross earnings. 7. Post-pandemic enthusiasm: There's been a trend of big blockbusters performing well as audiences return to theaters post-pandemic. 8. Competition and release timing: We don't have information about other major releases around the same time, which could affect its performance. 9. Marketing push: Given the high expectations, it's likely that Disney/Marvel will invest heavily in marketing the film. 10. Critical reception: While unknown at this point, positive reviews could boost opening weekend performance. However, we should also consider potential challenges: 1. R-rating: This limits the audience compared to PG-13 superhero films. 2. Sequel fatigue: Some audiences might be less enthusiastic about another superhero film. 3. Unexpected events: Global events or controversies could potentially impact theater attendance. Given the strong projections, established popularity of the characters, star power, and the MCU connection, it seems highly likely that \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" will break the R-rated opening weekend record.

The success of the Moana animated series and the upcoming live-action film suggests Disney is investing in this franchise. However, the question specifies that it must be for Magic Kingdom in Florida, which limits the possibilities. The caveat about 'spitballing ideas' not counting also reduces the likelihood. D23 is a major event for Disney announcements, but they might prioritize other projects. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 30%. b) Deadpool & Wolverine having the biggest R-rated opening weekend: The Deadpool franchise has a strong track record, with the original holding the current record. The addition of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to the cast is likely to draw even more viewers. The Marvel Cinematic Universe connection could boost interest. R-rated superhero films have been successful recently (e.g., Joker, Logan). However, the global box office is still recovering from the pandemic, which could affect results. The target to beat ($284.5M) is quite high, especially for an R-rated film. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 60%. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of either of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.30 + 0.60 - (0.30 * 0.60) = 0.90 - 0.18 = 0.72.

Current trends: As of the question's creation date (June 1, 2024), Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points. This suggests that Trump has some momentum, but it's still relatively close. 2. Time frame: We're looking at a projection about 1.5 months into the future from the question's creation date. A lot can happen in this time, but major shifts in polling are less likely than small fluctuations. 3.

This is a relatively narrow range, which makes it less likely than a broader range would be. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Trump's lead will fall within this specific range. The current 2.4-point lead is already within this range, which is a positive indicator. However, the narrowness of the range and the potential for changes over the next 1.5 months make it far from certain. I estimate that there's about a 30% chance that Trump's lead will be in this specific range on July 15, 2024.

Growth potential: Nvidia has been experiencing rapid growth due to its dominance in AI chips and GPU technology. The AI boom has significantly boosted Nvidia's stock price and market cap in recent months. 3.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average: The question asks for a very specific range: greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 points. As of the creation date (June 1, 2024), we don't have current polling data for July 15, 2024. Historical trends and current political climate would need to be considered. Polls can fluctuate significantly, especially in the months leading up to an election. The specific range is quite narrow, which makes it less likely to occur.

(b) Nvidia's market capitalization larger than Apple's: As of 2023, Apple has a significantly larger market cap than Nvidia. However, Nvidia has been growing rapidly due to its dominance in AI chips. The tech market can be volatile, and a year is a long time in the tech industry. Apple's market cap could decrease, or Nvidia's could increase substantially. This scenario is possible but would require significant market shifts. Let's estimate this at around 25% probability. Combining probabilities: The question asks if either (a) or (b) will occur.

Current polling trends: As of July 5, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points. This is within the range we're looking for, but we need to consider potential changes over the next 10 days. 2. Historical polling volatility: Presidential polls can fluctuate, but major shifts within a short period are less common unless significant events occur. 3.

Given that Trump's lead is already at 2.4 points on July 5, it's plausible that it could remain within the 2-3 point range by July 15. The short timeframe (10 days) makes dramatic shifts less likely, barring any major unforeseen events. However, there are several factors that could push the lead outside this range: - A slight increase in Trump's support or decrease in Biden's could push the lead above 3 points. - Conversely, a small shift in Biden's favor could bring the lead below 2 points. - The precise nature of the range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) makes the target quite narrow.

International pressure: The current global focus on the Israel-Hamas conflict and calls for de-escalation might discourage Israel from opening a new front with Iran. 6.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average: As of now, it's difficult to predict with high accuracy what the polling average will be on a specific date (July 15, 2024) over a year from now. Polls can fluctuate significantly due to various factors such as economic conditions, international events, scandals, or campaign performances. However, recent trends have shown Trump and Biden in a close race, often within a few percentage points of each other. A lead of 2-3 points for Trump is within the realm of possibility, but it's not highly probable given the uncertainty and time until the specified date. (b) Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran: Tensions between Israel and Iran have been high for years, with occasional covert operations and cyber attacks. However, a direct, deadly attack by Israel within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation. While not impossible, such an action would carry enormous risks of broader conflict and international condemnation. Israel typically prefers covert operations or strikes on Iranian-linked targets outside of Iran itself.

Historical context: The VXVCLS is a measure of expected volatility in the S&P 500 index over the next 3 months. It tends to increase during periods of market uncertainty and decrease during periods of stability. Current market conditions: As of April 2024, we're experiencing a relatively stable market with moderate volatility levels. However, the economic landscape can change rapidly. Potential future events: By July 2024, several factors could impact market volatility: a) The U.S. presidential election in November 2024 might cause increased uncertainty. b) Ongoing geopolitical tensions could escalate or de-escalate. c) Economic policies and interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve. d) Potential technological disruptions or breakthroughs. Cyclical patterns: Volatility tends to have some seasonal patterns, with summer months often experiencing lower volatility. However, this is not a hard rule. Mean reversion: Volatility indices tend to revert to their mean over time. If the current volatility is below average, there's a higher chance it will increase in the future. Time frame: The question asks about a specific date (July 20, 2024) compared to the same date a year earlier. This narrow window makes the prediction more challenging. Given these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher chance that the VXVCLS will be higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024. The main reasons for this assessment are: 1. The upcoming U.S. presidential election in November 2024 is likely to introduce uncertainty in the markets as we approach the date. 2. The current relatively stable market conditions suggest that there's more room for volatility to increase rather than decrease further. 3. The ongoing global economic recovery post-pandemic may lead to policy shifts and market adjustments, potentially increasing volatility.

International pressure: The international community, including Israel's allies, may be working to de-escalate the situation and prevent further military actions. 6. Strategic considerations: Israel might prefer covert operations or cyber attacks over a direct, deadly attack within Iran to avoid further escalation or international condemnation. 7. Defensive posture: Israel may focus on bolstering its defenses and intercepting potential threats rather than launching an offensive attack. Given these factors, there is a significant possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran, but the short timeframe and potential for diplomatic intervention somewhat reduce the likelihood.

(a) The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index: The volatility index is a measure of market expectations of near-term volatility. Predicting this a year in advance is challenging, as it depends on various economic factors, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. However, we can consider some factors: 1. Current market conditions: As of April 2024, the market has been relatively stable, but there are concerns about inflation and potential economic slowdowns. 2. Historical trends: Volatility tends to increase during times of uncertainty or economic stress. 3. Upcoming events: The 2024 U.S. presidential election could increase market volatility. 4. Potential for unexpected events: Global conflicts, natural disasters, or economic shocks could increase volatility.

(b) Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran: This is a highly sensitive geopolitical issue. Several factors to consider: 1. Current tensions: There are ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear program. 2.

For example, in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Belinda Bencic of Switzerland won gold in women's singles and silver in women's doubles. 3. Dominance of top players: Tennis is a sport where top players often maintain their dominance across multiple events. Players like Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, or Serena Williams (if she decides to compete) have the potential to win in both singles and doubles categories. 4. Team strategies: Many countries strategically pair their top singles players in doubles events to maximize medal chances.

(a) An athlete wins more than one medal for tennis: In tennis, there are five events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. It's not uncommon for top players to participate in both singles and doubles events. Historically, we've seen players win multiple medals in tennis at the Olympics. For example, Venus Williams has won four Olympic medals in tennis across different Games. However, winning multiple medals in a single Olympics is less common but still possible. The probability of this happening is moderate, perhaps around 30-40%. (b) Individual Neutral Athletes win 21 or more gold medals: This part is more challenging to predict. 'Individual Neutral Athletes' typically refers to athletes from countries that are banned from competing under their national flag, often due to doping violations or other issues. The most prominent example in recent years has been Russian athletes competing as neutral participants. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) athletes, competing as neutrals, won 20 gold medals. This is very close to the 21 gold medal threshold mentioned in the question. However, there are several factors to consider: 1. The status of Russian and Belarusian athletes for the 2024 Paris Olympics is still uncertain due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. 2. If allowed to compete, they may face stricter limitations on the number of athletes. 3. The performance of these athletes can vary from one Olympics to another.

Margin of error: Polls typically have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points, which means small changes within this range are not necessarily significant. 6. Trend direction: We don't know if the 2.4 point lead on July 5 was part of an increasing or decreasing trend for Trump. Given that Trump's lead is already within the specified range (2.4 points on July 5), and considering the short time frame, it seems reasonably likely that his lead will remain within this range on July 15. However, there's also a significant chance it could fall below 2 points or rise above 4 points. The current lead being so close to the lower bound (2 points) suggests a higher probability of falling below that threshold than exceeding the upper bound (4 points). However, without knowing the trend direction, this is not certain. Considering all these factors, I estimate there's a moderate probability that Trump's lead will be between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "1914a6e3-d1a5-4772-89da-d2d67ddcacfd", "title": "Will Kamala Harris be the Democratic VP?", "body": "If Kamala Harris is nominated as the Democratic VP, this market will resolve to yes.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average: This part is highly uncertain as it's predicting a very specific polling outcome more than a year in advance. Current polls (as of July 2023) show a close race between Trump and Biden, with some polls favoring Trump and others favoring Biden. The specified range (lead greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4) is quite narrow, making it less likely to occur. However, given the volatility of polls and potential events that could occur before July 2024, it's not impossible for Trump to have such a lead. I'd estimate the probability of this specific condition being met at around 15-20%. (b) Kamala Harris being the Democratic VP: Kamala Harris is the current Vice President and has been working closely with President Biden. Historically, incumbent presidents tend to keep their running mates when seeking re-election. There have been no significant indications from the Biden administration about changing the VP for the 2024 ticket. However, there are occasional rumors and speculations about potential changes, and Harris's approval ratings have been relatively low. Despite these factors, the likelihood of Harris remaining as the VP nominee is quite high. I'd estimate the probability of Harris being the Democratic VP nominee at around 85-90%. Combining these probabilities, we need to consider that only one of these conditions needs to be met for the question to resolve YES. Using the complement rule of probability: P(Either A or B) = 1 - P(Neither A nor B) = 1 - (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)). Using the higher end of our estimates: P(A) = 0.20 (Trump's lead in the specified range) P(B) = 0.90 (Harris as VP nominee). P(Either A or B) = 1 - (1 - 0.20) * (1 - 0.90) = 1 - 0.80 * 0.10 = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92.

Time frame: We have approximately one year from now until the end of July 2024, which is a considerable amount of time for such an interview to occur. 3. Election cycle: As we approach the 2024 presidential election, Biden (assuming he runs for re-election) will likely increase his media presence to reach voters. Long-form interviews can be an effective way to communicate his message and connect with the electorate. 4. Campaign strategy: Biden's team may see value in scheduling longer interviews to allow for more in-depth discussions on policy issues and to counter any narratives about his ability to handle lengthy conversations. 5. Media interest: Given Biden's position as President and potential candidate for re-election, there will likely be significant media interest in securing long-form interviews with him. 6. Potential constraints: Biden's schedule as President is extremely busy, which could limit opportunities for extended interviews. Additionally, his team may prefer shorter, more controlled media appearances to minimize the risk of gaffes or misstatements. 7. Past interview frequency: While the question doesn't provide comprehensive data on Biden's interview history, it does mention several interviews that didn't meet the 45-minute threshold. This suggests that while Biden does participate in interviews, longer ones may be less common. 8. Flexibility of format: The question allows for various formats, including podcasts, late-night shows, or edited shows like 60 Minutes, as long as there's at least 45 minutes of new footage of Biden being interviewed in-person. This flexibility increases the chances of a qualifying interview occurring. Considering these factors, I believe there is a good chance that Biden will participate in at least one qualifying interview before the end of July 2024. The approaching election, the extended time frame, and the flexibility in interview formats all contribute to this likelihood.

The question asks if this lead will be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024.

Assuming these events are independent (which is a reasonable assumption), P(A and B) would be the product of their individual probabilities.

Swimmers like Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz, and Katie Ledecky have dominated their respective Olympics by winning numerous gold medals. The nature of swimming events, with various strokes and distances, allows versatile swimmers to compete in multiple events. In recent Olympics, swimmers have often been among the top medal winners. For example, in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Caeleb Dressel won five gold medals in swimming, tying for the most golds with a track athlete. In 2016, Michael Phelps won five golds, the most of any athlete.

At least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early: This scenario seems more likely to occur. The context provided indicates that there is significant dissatisfaction among House Democrats regarding the DNC's plan to nominate Biden early. Rep. Jared Huffman is already circulating a draft letter, and the article mentions 'dozens' of House Democrats are organizing against this plan. Given that only 20 signatures are needed, and there are over 200 Democratic members in the House, it seems quite possible that this threshold could be reached. The timeframe (until July 21st) also provides ample time for organizing and gathering signatures. 2. Larry Elder being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: This scenario is highly unlikely. Larry Elder, while known in conservative circles, is not considered a frontrunner for the Republican nomination. He has not held major political office and his national profile is relatively low compared to other potential candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley. The Republican field is expected to be competitive, and it would be a significant upset if Elder were to secure the nomination. Considering these two scenarios, the first one seems much more likely to occur than the second. Since the question asks if 'either' will occur, we only need one of these to happen for a 'Yes' resolution. The probability of at least 20 Democrats signing a letter seems reasonably high, perhaps around 60-70%. The probability of Larry Elder becoming the nominee is very low, likely less than 1%. When we combine these probabilities, considering that only one needs to occur for a 'Yes' resolution, the overall probability leans towards 'Yes', but is tempered by the uncertainty surrounding the letter-signing effort."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.012003198106392762, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.004001066035464254, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15504341823651052, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Number of countries without gold medals: As of 2023, there are still over 70 countries that have never won an Olympic gold medal. This provides a large pool of potential first-time winners. 3. Emerging sports powerhouses: Some countries have been investing heavily in their Olympic programs and have been improving their performances in recent years. For example, countries like India (which has few gold medals relative to its population) might be poised for breakthrough performances. 4. New Olympic sports: The 2024 Olympics will feature new sports like breaking (breakdancing), which could provide opportunities for countries with strengths in these areas to win their first gold. 5. Competitive landscape: The Olympics are becoming increasingly competitive, with more countries developing world-class athletes. This could make it more difficult for new countries to break through. 6.

Current geopolitical situation: The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may lead to continued sanctions on Russian athletes, potentially increasing the number of athletes competing as neutrals. 3. Talent pool: Many Russian and Belarusian athletes, who are likely to compete as neutrals, are world-class competitors in various sports, particularly in disciplines like gymnastics, wrestling, and track and field. 4. Time frame: The market was created about a month before the Olympics, which suggests that the status of neutral athletes might be more certain at this point. 5. IOC decisions: The IOC has been allowing neutral athletes to compete, but the exact conditions and number of athletes permitted may vary. 6. Competition level: The overall competitiveness of the Olympics means that winning 15 gold medals is a significant achievement, even for a group of neutral athletes from strong sporting nations. 7. Psychological factors: Competing as neutral athletes might affect performance positively (desire to prove oneself) or negatively (lack of national identity and support). Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Individual Neutral Athletes could win 15 or more gold medals. The historical precedent from Tokyo 2020 is encouraging, but the target of 15 gold medals is still quite high. The geopolitical situation and the likely inclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes as neutrals increase the probability. However, uncertainties remain about the exact number of neutral athletes allowed to compete and potential restrictions on their participation.

Condition B: Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals - Russian and Belarusian athletes: These athletes are likely to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes due to ongoing geopolitical situations. - Historical performance: Russia has consistently been a top performer in the Olympics.

Liz Cheney being the Republican nominee for 2024: Liz Cheney has become a polarizing figure within the Republican Party due to her criticism of former President Trump and her role in the January 6th committee. She lost her House seat in Wyoming's primary election in 2022, indicating a lack of support from her own party's base. The Republican Party has largely aligned itself with Trump's policies and rhetoric, making it highly unlikely for Cheney to secure the nomination. The probability of this occurring is extremely low, perhaps less than 1%. 2. Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024: As of now (2023), Joe Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. However, there are several factors that could potentially change this: a) Biden's age: He would be 82 at the start of a second term, which raises concerns about his ability to serve effectively. b) Health issues: Any significant health problems could prompt him to step aside. c) Poor approval ratings: If his popularity continues to decline, he might decide it's better for the party to have a different candidate. d) Family considerations: Personal reasons could lead to a change in his plans. Despite these factors, it's still more likely that Biden will run for re-election. Presidents rarely choose not to seek a second term, and the Democratic Party doesn't have a clear alternative candidate with broad support. The probability of Biden announcing he won't accept the nomination before July 15, 2024, is higher than Cheney becoming the Republican nominee, but still relatively low - perhaps around 15-20%. Combining these probabilities, we need to consider the chance of either event occurring. Since they are independent events, we can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Given that the probability of both events happening simultaneously is negligible, we can essentially add the probabilities.

While right-wing and populist parties have been gaining ground in various European countries, it would be a significant shift for ID to become the largest group. The current largest groups (EPP, S&D) have traditionally held more seats and have broader appeal across multiple countries.
