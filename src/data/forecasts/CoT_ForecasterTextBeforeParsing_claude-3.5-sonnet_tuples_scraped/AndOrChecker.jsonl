Donald Trump Jr. has not announced any intention to run. 2. Name recognition: While Donald Trump Jr. has a high profile due to his father's presidency, he has never held elected office himself, which could be a significant disadvantage. 3. Political experience: Compared to other potential candidates, Donald Trump Jr. lacks direct political experience, which voters and party officials often consider important for a presidential nominee. 4. Family dynasty concerns: There might be hesitation within the Republican Party to nominate another Trump family member so soon after Donald Trump Sr.'s presidency, as it could be seen as promoting a political dynasty. 5. Base support: While Donald Trump Jr. is popular among his father's base, it's unclear if he could expand that support to win a primary contest against more experienced politicians. 6. Timing: With the resolution date set for August 1, 2024, there is still time for unexpected developments. However, candidates typically announce their intentions well in advance, and Donald Trump Jr. has not indicated any plans to run. 7. Party dynamics: The Republican Party may be looking for a candidate who can unite different factions within the party and appeal to a broader electorate in the general election. 8. Legal considerations: Any ongoing investigations or legal issues involving the Trump family could potentially impact Donald Trump Jr.'s viability as a candidate. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Donald Trump Jr. will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Policy positions: Hutchinson's more moderate stance on some issues may not align well with the current Republican base, which tends to favor more conservative positions. 6. Trump factor: The influence of Donald Trump on the Republican Party remains significant. Hutchinson has been critical of Trump, which could alienate a large portion of the Republican base. 7. Time until convention: While there is still time until the Republican National Convention in 2024, Hutchinson would need to make significant gains in popularity and support to become a serious contender. 8.

Pence's appeal: While Pence has experience as Vice President and Governor of Indiana, he lacks the charisma and broad appeal that typically characterizes successful presidential candidates. His conservative stance might appeal to some Republicans but may not be enough to secure the nomination. 4.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history.

Let's analyze each part separately: (a) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024: As of now (July 2024), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election. It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of the race, especially this close to the election. Biden has been actively campaigning and fundraising, and there are no strong indications that he's considering stepping aside. While his age and approval ratings have been topics of discussion, the Democratic Party has not shown any significant push to replace him. The likelihood of Biden making such an announcement in the next two weeks is very low. (b) Kamala Harris's odds of winning increasing over the next week according to Nate Silver's model: This part is more challenging to predict without current data from Nate Silver's model. However, we can make some educated guesses: 1. Harris is currently the Vice President, and her chances of winning the presidency are typically tied to Biden's performance and decisions. 2. For her odds to increase significantly (to over 46.6%) in just one week, there would likely need to be a major event or announcement affecting Biden's candidacy. 3. Given that we've already established that Biden is unlikely to drop out, such a dramatic shift in Harris's odds seems improbable. 4. Nate Silver's models are generally quite stable and don't tend to show large swings without significant new information or events. Considering both parts together, the probability of either event occurring is still quite low.

(a) Joe Biden dying before July 26th, 2024: Joe Biden is currently 80 years old (born November 20, 1942). While he is in generally good health for his age, the mortality risk for individuals in their early 80s is not negligible. According to actuarial tables, the annual mortality rate for an 80-year-old male in the US is around 5.5%. However, Biden likely has access to excellent healthcare, which may reduce this risk somewhat. The timeframe from now until July 26th, 2024 is about one year, so we can use this annual mortality rate as a rough estimate. (b) Biden not remaining President through the end of July 2024: This part encompasses more possibilities, including resignation, impeachment, or other reasons for leaving office. Biden has not shown any indication of planning to resign, and there are currently no serious impeachment efforts against him. However, political situations can change rapidly, and health issues could potentially lead to a resignation. The probability of this occurring is likely higher than the probability of death alone, but still relatively low given Biden's apparent commitment to his role and the stability of his administration. Combining these factors: The probability of (a) occurring is roughly 5.5% based on actuarial tables, but let's adjust it down to about 4% considering Biden's access to healthcare. The probability of (b) occurring is harder to quantify but is likely somewhat higher than (a). Let's estimate it at about 7%, which includes the possibility of death as well as other reasons for leaving office. Since the question resolves YES if either (a) or (b) occurs, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of these events happening. The probability of neither event occurring is (1 - 0.04) * (1 - 0.07) = 0.8928, or 89.28%.

However, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned this decision in March 2024, ruling that states cannot unilaterally disqualify candidates for federal office under the 14th Amendment. 2. Supreme Court ruling impact: The Supreme Court's decision sets a strong precedent that makes it significantly less likely for any state to successfully remove Trump from their primary ballot under the 14th Amendment. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is after the primary season for most states. By this time, most primaries will have already taken place, reducing the likelihood of new attempts to remove Trump from ballots. 4. Political climate: Despite the legal setbacks, there remains strong opposition to Trump's candidacy among some groups, which could potentially lead to further attempts to block his candidacy through other means. 5. Other legal challenges: While the 14th Amendment route has been largely closed off, Trump faces other legal challenges that could potentially impact his candidacy. However, these are not relevant to this specific question. 6. State-level actions: The question only requires one state to remove or block Trump from the ballot. However, given the Supreme Court's ruling, it's highly unlikely that any state would attempt this again, as it would likely be quickly overturned.

While there have been efforts to invoke the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running for office due to his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot, it's far from certain that these efforts will succeed. Several factors to consider: 1. Legal challenges: Any attempt to remove Trump from the ballot would likely face immediate and vigorous legal challenges. 2. State-by-state basis: The question only requires one state to remove or block Trump, which increases the likelihood. 3. Political implications: States might be hesitant to take such a controversial step due to potential backlash. 4.

(a) Donald Trump being removed from a primary ballot under the 14th Amendment: This scenario has gained some traction recently, with legal scholars and some politicians arguing that Trump's actions related to the January 6th Capitol riot could disqualify him under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. However, there are several factors to consider: 1. Legal uncertainty: The application of the 14th Amendment in this context is unprecedented and would likely face significant legal challenges. 2. Political resistance: Many Republicans would strongly oppose such a move, potentially influencing decision-makers. 3. Time constraints: The deadline is July 15, 2024, which gives time for legal battles but also increases uncertainty. 4. State-by-state basis: Even if one state removes Trump, others may not follow suit. Given these factors, while there's a possibility of this occurring, it seems unlikely. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 15%. (b) Ted Cruz being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: This scenario seems even less likely for several reasons: 1. Current polling: Trump is currently the frontrunner for the Republican nomination by a significant margin. 2. Cruz's position: He's not currently a declared candidate for the 2024 election. 3. Party dynamics: The Republican establishment, while sometimes at odds with Trump, has not shown a strong preference for Cruz. 4. Historical precedent: It's rare for a party to nominate someone who isn't actively campaigning. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Cruz becoming the nominee at around 2%. Combining these probabilities, and accounting for the fact that only one needs to occur for a 'Yes' resolution, we can use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

Party dynamics: The Republican Party might be looking for a candidate who can appeal to a broader electorate, which could work against Trump Jr. 6. Time until convention: There is still significant time until the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the political landscape could change dramatically. 7. Legal issues: Both Donald Trump Sr. and Jr. have been involved in various legal controversies, which could impact their political futures. 8. Precedent: It's highly unusual for a major party to nominate the child of a former president as their candidate, especially when that former president is still politically active. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Donald Trump Jr. will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. While not impossible, it would require a series of unlikely events, such as his father dropping out of the race and endorsing him, other major candidates faltering, and a significant shift in party dynamics."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "efa7fb4f-5cd9-406c-98e9-8282aa83d6c6", "title": "Will Chris Christie be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Chris Christie is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Experience and recognition: While Nikki Haley has more national recognition as a former UN Ambassador and governor of South Carolina, Francis Suarez is relatively unknown outside of Florida. 5. Historical precedent: It's rare for candidates polling so low this far out from the convention to surge and win the nomination. 6. Time until convention: There is still time for dynamics to change, but it would require a significant shift in the political landscape or major scandals affecting the frontrunners. 7. Delegate math: The Republican primary system tends to favor frontrunners, making it difficult for lower-polling candidates to gain momentum. 8. Potential for dropouts: There's a possibility that either Suarez or Haley (or both) may drop out before the convention if their campaigns fail to gain traction. Given these factors, the chances of either Suarez or Haley winning the nomination appear quite low. Haley has a slightly better chance than Suarez due to her higher national profile, but both are significant underdogs compared to Trump and DeSantis.

At least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early: This seems somewhat likely given the context provided. The Politico article suggests that 'dozens' of House Democrats are organizing to speak out against the early nomination plan. Rep. Jared Huffman is circulating a draft letter, which indicates there's already some momentum behind this effort. However, we don't know exactly how many will ultimately sign. The threshold of 20 is not extremely high, considering there are currently 213 Democratic Representatives and 48 Democratic Senators (plus 3 Independents who caucus with Democrats). Given the apparent discontent and the relatively low threshold, this part seems fairly likely. 2. 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20: This is a much more extreme and unlikely scenario. Calling for a sitting president of one's own party to drop out is a very significant step that could have major political consequences. As of now, there's no indication that any Democratic Senators are publicly considering such a move. Biden, despite some concerns about his age and popularity, is still the incumbent president and the presumptive nominee. For 10 Senators (over 20% of the Democratic caucus) to call for his withdrawal would be unprecedented and highly disruptive to the party. Combining these two events, the overall probability becomes quite low. While the first event seems reasonably possible, the second is highly unlikely. For both to occur, we would need to see a dramatic and rapid shift in the Democratic Party's stance towards Biden, which doesn't seem probable given the current political landscape and the short timeframe (until July 20)."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "8a5568a5-be1c-4729-b1b6-e744a45fed31", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early?

Time until the convention: With the Republican National Convention still over a year away, there's ample time for the political landscape to shift dramatically. Unforeseen events or scandals could significantly impact candidates' chances. 6. Trump's legal issues: Ongoing legal challenges facing Trump could potentially impact his ability to run or his popularity among voters, which could benefit other candidates like DeSantis or Cruz. 7. Party dynamics: The Republican Party's internal dynamics and the preferences of key donors and influencers will play a crucial role in determining the nominee. Considering these factors, Ron DeSantis appears to have a stronger chance than Ted Cruz of securing the nomination if Trump doesn't run or loses support. However, Trump's current frontrunner status significantly reduces the likelihood of either Cruz or DeSantis becoming the nominee. Given the current political climate and polling data, I would estimate that there's roughly a 30-35% chance that either Cruz or DeSantis becomes the Republican nominee. This takes into account the possibility of Trump's candidacy faltering and the potential for one of these two candidates (more likely DeSantis) to emerge as the party's choice."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.000866067758187837, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00021651693954695926, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07211464655183289, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given these factors, Belgium appears to have a better chance of qualifying than Latvia based on recent history. For both countries to qualify, we would need Latvia to break its non-qualification streak and Belgium to maintain its relatively good performance. The probability of both qualifying is lower than either country qualifying individually. If we assume Belgium has about a 60% chance of qualifying (based on recent performance) and Latvia has about a 30% chance (being optimistic about a potential improvement), the probability of both qualifying would be the product of these individual probabilities.

Belgium has had slightly better success historically and more recently than Latvia. However, Eurovision results can be unpredictable, and a strong entry from either country could lead to qualification.

Current status: As of now (July 2023), Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024 and has begun campaigning. 3. Age and health concerns: Biden is currently 80 years old and would be 82 at the start of a second term. While his health appears stable, concerns about his age persist. 4. Approval ratings: Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, but not catastrophically so. They could potentially improve before the election. 5. Democratic Party support: Despite some concerns, the Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden's re-election bid. 6. Lack of strong alternatives: There are no clear frontrunners within the Democratic Party who could easily replace Biden as the nominee. 7. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely for an incumbent to wait this long to make such a significant announcement. 8. Historical precedent: The last incumbent president to not seek re-election was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, and that was under very different circumstances. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he won't accept the nomination.

Biden's age and health: At 80 years old, Biden is already the oldest serving president in U.S. history. Concerns about his age and fitness for office could potentially lead to internal party pressure for him to step aside. 3.

This timing makes it unlikely for such drastic changes to occur so close to the convention. 5. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election campaign, especially this close to the election. 6. Party unity: Democrats are likely to prioritize party unity in the face of a challenging election, making it less likely for a group of lawmakers to publicly pressure Biden to step aside. 7. Lack of clear alternative: There's no clear consensus alternative candidate who could step in if Biden were to drop out, which reduces the likelihood of internal party pressure. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for either of these scenarios to occur, it seems highly unlikely. The Democratic Party is more likely to rally behind Biden, despite any concerns, than to risk the chaos of a last-minute candidate change.

(a) Joe Biden dying before Saturday, July 27th, 2024: Joe Biden is currently 81 years old (born in 1942). While his age puts him at higher risk of health issues, he appears to be in relatively good health for his age. The probability of any person dying within a specific 3-week period is generally low, even for someone in their 80s. Without any specific health concerns reported, the chance of this happening is quite small. (b) The 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee being a Woman: As of now (July 2024), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election. While there have been calls for younger candidates, Biden has not indicated any intention to step down. The Democratic Party has shown strong support for Biden's re-election bid. However, if Biden were to unexpectedly withdraw or be unable to run, there are several prominent female Democrats who could potentially become the nominee, such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, or Amy Klobuchar. In such a scenario, there would be a significant chance of a woman becoming the nominee, but this scenario itself is unlikely given Biden's current position. Combining these factors: The probability of (a) is very low, likely less than 1%. The probability of (b) is also low, but slightly higher, perhaps around 5-10% considering the possibility of unforeseen circumstances leading to Biden's withdrawal and a female candidate taking his place. Since the question asks if EITHER of these will occur, we need to combine these probabilities. The probability of at least one of these events occurring is higher than either individual probability, but still relatively low given the current political landscape and Biden's health status."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.01475847360219603, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0036896184005490076, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17619020168705962, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Strategic importance: Chasiv Yar is considered a gateway to larger cities in the Donetsk region, making it a valuable target for Russian forces. 3. Time frame: The question resolves on June 1, 2024, which is about 13 months from now. This is a significant amount of time in terms of military operations. 4. Recent trends: The war has been characterized by slow, grinding advances and occasional successful counteroffensives. Neither side has made rapid, large-scale gains in recent months. 5. Russian objectives: Capturing Donetsk Oblast remains a key goal for Russia, and taking Chasiv Yar would be a step towards that objective. 6. Ukrainian defenses: Ukraine has been fortifying its positions and has shown resilience in defending key areas. 7. International support: Continued Western support for Ukraine could influence its ability to hold the line or even push back Russian forces. 8. Russian resources: Russia has shown a willingness to commit significant resources to the war, but also faces challenges in terms of manpower and equipment. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that Russia could capture Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024, but it's far from certain. The time frame allows for potential Russian advances, but also for Ukrainian resistance and possible counteroffensives. The strategic importance of the town means Russia is likely to continue targeting it, but Ukraine will also prioritize its defense.

Incumbency advantage: Historically, sitting presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless facing significant health issues or extreme unpopularity. Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Current intentions: Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He officially launched his campaign on April 25, 2023, which is a strong indicator of his commitment to seeking a second term. 3.

Party support: Despite some concerns about his age, Biden still enjoys significant support from the Democratic Party establishment. There's no clear alternative candidate who could unite the party as effectively. 5. Political landscape: The Republican field is still taking shape, with Donald Trump as a frontrunner. The Democrats may see Biden as their best chance to defeat Trump or another Republican nominee. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's highly unlikely for a sitting president to withdraw so late in the process without extraordinary circumstances. 7. Recent precedent: No incumbent president has declined to seek re-election since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, and that was under very different circumstances.

Evidence of potential witness tampering: There have been reports and allegations of Trump attempting to influence witnesses in various investigations. For example, in January 2022, he was accused of trying to influence Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to 'find' votes. 3. Ongoing investigation: The Georgia case is still active, and prosecutors are known to be examining Trump's actions and communications related to the 2020 election. 4. Timeframe: The question gives a deadline of June 1, 2024, which is over a year away. This provides ample time for investigators to gather evidence and for prosecutors to bring charges if warranted. 5. Precedent: While it's rare for a former president to face criminal charges, the fact that Trump has already been indicted in other cases (e.g., the classified documents case in Florida) shows that prosecutors are willing to pursue charges against him. 6.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. It would be highly unusual and politically disruptive for an incumbent president to withdraw from the race, especially this late in the election cycle.

Competition: The Republican field is likely to be crowded with more established politicians. Figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, and Nikki Haley have much higher national profiles and stronger bases of support within the party. 3. Fundraising: While Ramaswamy has personal wealth, he may struggle to match the fundraising capabilities of more established candidates who have extensive donor networks. 4. Policy positions: Ramaswamy's views align with many conservative principles, which could appeal to the Republican base. However, his lack of political experience may raise questions about his ability to implement these ideas effectively. 5. Media attention: He has received some media coverage, but it's significantly less than that of front-runners like Trump or DeSantis. 6. Party establishment support: As a political outsider, Ramaswamy may struggle to gain support from the Republican party establishment, which often plays a crucial role in the nomination process. 7. Time until convention: With the convention still over a year away, there is time for Ramaswamy to build his profile and support. However, this also gives time for other candidates to consolidate their positions. 8. Historical precedent: It's rare for a political newcomer with no prior elected office to secure a major party nomination, though not impossible (as demonstrated by Trump in 2016). Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Ramaswamy to secure the nomination, it appears highly unlikely. He faces significant challenges in terms of name recognition, political experience, and party support compared to other potential candidates."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a8b01e6e-7dc3-42cb-8641-fd7755314993", "title": "Will Rishi Sunak fail to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if for any reason Rishi Sunak fails to be elected as a Member of Parliament in the July 4 2024 UK general election.\n\nIf Sunak is elected as a Member of Parliament for any constituency in the July 4 2024 UK general election, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nResolution should cite [credible](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) media reports, or an official announcement from the returning officer of the constituency in which Sunak is a candidate (if he is a candidate in any constituency).", "resolution_date": "2024-07-04T22:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-02-22T16:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.03, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of Rishi Sunak failing to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election, we need to consider several factors: 1.

This is a relatively short timeframe for such a significant trade decision, especially considering that the investigation is not set to conclude until after this date. 4. Political pressure: There is increasing pressure from European automakers and some EU member states to protect the domestic EV industry from Chinese competition. 5. Potential retaliation: The EU must consider the risk of retaliation from China, which could impact other sectors of EU-China trade. 6. Global economic conditions: The current economic climate and any changes in the coming months could influence the EU's decision on whether to impose new tariffs. 7.

(a) EU announcing new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024: The EU has been concerned about the influx of cheaper Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years. There's an ongoing investigation into whether Chinese EV manufacturers are benefiting from unfair subsidies. The European Commission launched this probe in September 2023, and it's expected to conclude by November 2024. However, preliminary findings could lead to earlier action. Given the EU's protectionist tendencies and the pressure from European automakers, there's a significant chance that the EU might announce new tariffs before July 2024.

(b) At least 5 named Democratic House Members or Senators pressuring Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024: This scenario is less likely. Despite concerns about Biden's age and some polls showing low approval ratings, the Democratic Party has largely rallied behind Biden for the 2024 election. There's a strong tradition in U.S. politics of supporting the incumbent president for re-election. However, if Biden's poll numbers were to significantly worsen or if there were a major gaffe or health concern, some Democrats might consider asking him to step aside. But for five or more to do so publicly and collectively would be extraordinary and potentially damaging to the party. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 15%.

Let's break it down: 1. Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024: This is a very specific range for Trump's lead. While current polls show Trump with a slight lead, predicting such a precise margin over a year in advance is challenging. Polls can fluctuate significantly, and many factors can influence them between now and July 2024. The probability of hitting this exact range is relatively low, perhaps around 15-20%. 2. Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination: This is highly unlikely. Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election and has already launched his 2024 campaign. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for him to step aside, he and his team have repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to running. For Biden to reverse course and decline the nomination would be a major political shock. The probability of this happening is very low, perhaps around 5-10%. For both of these events to occur simultaneously, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. Even if we take the higher estimates for each event (20% for the polling condition and 10% for Biden's withdrawal), the combined probability would be 0.20 * 0.10 = 0.02 or 2%. However, it's worth noting that these events are not entirely independent. If Biden were to announce he's not accepting the nomination, it could potentially affect Trump's polling numbers.

However, recent polls have shown a close race between Trump and Biden, with some polls giving Trump a slight lead. The specific range of 2-3 points is quite narrow, which makes it less likely to occur.

However, there are concerns about his age (he would be 82 at the start of a second term) and his approval ratings have been relatively low. Despite these factors, it's still unlikely that he would withdraw before the nomination. Presidents rarely decline to run for a second term, and the Democratic Party doesn't have a clear alternative candidate. The probability of this occurring is low, perhaps around 15%. (b) A Trump family member being the Republican nominee: Donald Trump is currently the front-runner for the Republican nomination, despite his legal challenges. He has a strong base of support within the Republican Party and has consistently led in primary polls. Other Trump family members have much lower profiles in terms of political ambitions, making their nominations highly unlikely. The probability of Donald Trump securing the nomination is quite high, perhaps around 70%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of either of two events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), and assuming the events are independent: P(YES) = P(Biden withdraws) + P(Trump family nominee) - P(Both occur) \u2248 0.15 + 0.70 - (0.15 * 0.70) \u2248 0.85 - 0.105 \u2248 0.745.

Biden has expressed his intention to run for re-election in 2024, which suggests he plans to complete his current term. 4.

Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in several states to remove Trump from the ballot using the 14th Amendment.

Political climate: The use of the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump is highly controversial and politically charged. It's likely to face significant opposition from Republican-controlled state governments and Trump supporters. 5. Supreme Court involvement: Given the high-stakes nature of this issue, it's likely that any successful attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would be quickly appealed to the Supreme Court. The current conservative majority on the Court might be skeptical of such an interpretation of the 14th Amendment. 6. State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently, increasing the chances that at least one state might remove Trump from the ballot. 7.

Barring any unforeseen circumstances, it is highly likely that he will remain President through July 2024.

Current political landscape: As of now, Kamala Harris is the incumbent Vice President, and Joe Biden is expected to run for re-election in 2024. It's highly unusual for a sitting Vice President to choose a new running mate unless there are extraordinary circumstances. 2. Timing: The question states that Kamala will choose before August 7th, 2024. This is very close to the Democratic National Convention, which typically occurs in August of election years. However, it's important to note that incumbent presidents rarely change their running mates. 3. Candidates mentioned: a) Mark Kelly: A former astronaut and current U.S. Senator from Arizona. He's a moderate Democrat with a strong background in science and the military. b) Josh Shapiro: The current Governor of Pennsylvania, a key swing state. He has a strong record as Attorney General and won his gubernatorial race decisively. 4. Historical precedent: In modern U.S. politics, it's extremely rare for an incumbent president to change their vice presidential running mate. The last time this happened was in 1976 when Gerald Ford replaced Nelson Rockefeller with Bob Dole. 5. Current administration dynamics: There have been no significant indications of a rift between President Biden and Vice President Harris that would necessitate a change in the ticket. 6. Media speculation: While there may be media speculation about potential VP picks, it's important to note that such speculation is often unreliable, especially when dealing with an incumbent administration. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that Kamala Harris would be in a position to choose a new running mate for the 2024 election. The question appears to be based on a premise that is unlikely to occur - namely, that Harris would be selecting a running mate at all. The only scenario where this could happen is if there was a major, unexpected change in the current administration, such as President Biden deciding not to run for re-election and Harris becoming the presidential nominee. However, there are no credible indications of such a dramatic shift at this time. Therefore, the probability of the question resolving YES (Harris choosing either Kelly or Shapiro) is extremely low.

However, his approval ratings have been low, and there are concerns about his age and fitness for office. Trump, on the other hand, faces legal challenges but maintains a strong base of support. Given the volatility of politics and the long time until July 2024, it's difficult to predict with certainty. However, incumbency advantage and the tendency of 538 to favor more establishment candidates slightly increase the likelihood of Biden being the favorite. I'd estimate this at about 60% chance.

While both Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are rising stars in the Democratic Party, there are many other potential candidates Harris might consider. The pool of potential running mates is usually quite large, and the selection process considers many factors including geographical balance, ideological alignment, and complementary strengths. Given that only two specific individuals are mentioned, and there are many other possible choices, I'd estimate the probability of Harris choosing either Kelly or Shapiro at about 20%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to consider that these events are not entirely independent.

While sprinting times have been improving over the years, progress at the elite level is incremental. The current world record is 9.58s (also by Bolt), set in 2009. In the past decade, no one has come close to breaking Bolt's records. The fastest time in recent years was 9.76s by Christian Coleman in 2019.

Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals: This condition is highly dependent on geopolitical factors, particularly regarding Russia's participation in the Olympics. As of now, Russian and Belarusian athletes are banned from competing under their national flags due to the invasion of Ukraine. If this ban continues, they may compete as neutral athletes. Russia typically wins a significant number of gold medals (20-30) in recent Summer Olympics. However, competing as neutral athletes might affect performance and participation. Additionally, not all Russian athletes may be allowed to compete. Considering these factors, winning 15 or more gold medals as neutral athletes is possible but challenging.

However, we must also consider potential factors that could lead to a change: 1. Harris's approval ratings have been lower than Biden's at times, which could theoretically prompt a strategic change. 2. Unforeseen events or scandals could emerge that might necessitate a change, although this seems unlikely given the time Harris has already served without major issues. 3. Biden could decide not to run for re-election, which could open up the field for a new ticket entirely, though this scenario seems increasingly unlikely given his public statements. Considering all these factors, the probability of Kamala Harris being the Democratic VP nominee again is very high. While not absolutely certain, the combination of incumbency advantage, party unity considerations, and lack of compelling reasons for change make it highly likely that she will remain on the ticket."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "91d7d49e-b5a5-4dad-af04-1b10b7b9f542", "title": "Will Larry Elder be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

For Nvidia to surpass Apple in less than a year, it would require extraordinary growth from Nvidia or a significant decline from Apple. While Nvidia has been growing rapidly due to AI advancements, overtaking Apple in such a short timeframe seems unlikely. However, the tech market can be volatile, so it's not impossible.

Nature of swimming events: Swimming has many events (different strokes, distances, and relays) allowing talented swimmers to compete in multiple races and potentially win multiple medals. 3. Current swimming stars: We need to consider the current swimming landscape. Caeleb Dressel (USA) won five gold medals in Tokyo 2020, showing the potential for swimmers to dominate. Other swimmers like Katie Ledecky (USA) and Adam Peaty (GBR) have also shown consistent excellence. 4. Competition from other sports: Track and field athletes, particularly sprinters and distance runners, can also win multiple medals. Gymnasts, especially in women's events, have the potential to win multiple golds as well. 5. Team sports: While team sport athletes can win gold, they typically only win one per Olympics, making it less likely for them to be the top gold medal winner. 6. Recent Olympic trends: In Tokyo 2020, swimmers Caeleb Dressel (5 golds) and Emma McKeon (4 golds) were among the top individual gold medal winners, reinforcing swimming's strong position. 7. Time until the Olympics: With the Olympics about a year away, current top performers are likely to maintain their form, barring injuries or unexpected setbacks. Given these factors, swimmers have a strong chance of winning the most gold medals.

This diversity makes it less likely for a single nation to dominate across all of them. 3. Global competitiveness: Women's team sports have become increasingly competitive globally, with more nations investing in their programs and developing world-class teams. 4.

However, track and field athletes also have multiple opportunities for medals. The competition for most gold medals is typically between swimmers and track and field athletes. 2.

For condition (b), Joe Biden needs to remain President through the end of July 2024. This is highly likely as he is the incumbent president and has expressed his intention to run for re-election in 2024. The tricky part is that these two conditions seem somewhat contradictory.

This would need to be a temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment. 3. Biden would then need to resume his duties before the end of July 2024. While this scenario is possible (for example, if Biden undergoes a planned medical procedure requiring anesthesia), it's quite unlikely. Such temporary transfers of power are rare and usually very brief.

Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal: Sha'Carri Richardson is a talented American sprinter, known for her impressive performances in the 100m event. However, winning an Olympic gold medal is extremely challenging, especially in such a competitive field. Factors in her favor: - She has shown great potential and has been improving her times. - Home continent advantage (Olympics in Paris) might provide some benefit. Factors against: - Strong competition from other world-class sprinters. - The pressure of the Olympics can affect performance. - She has faced some setbacks in her career, including a suspension that prevented her from competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

(a) Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the nomination: As of now (July 2023), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. It's highly unusual for an incumbent president to withdraw from seeking re-nomination, especially this late in the process. Biden has consistently expressed his commitment to running again, and his campaign is actively preparing for the 2024 election. However, there are some factors that could potentially lead to a withdrawal: 1. Biden's age (he would be 82 at the start of a second term) and concerns about his health or cognitive abilities. 2. Extremely poor polling numbers or a significant political scandal. 3. Unforeseen personal or family issues. Given the current political landscape and Biden's stated intentions, the probability of him withdrawing before July 15, 2024, is quite low. (b) Kamala Harris being nominated as the Democratic VP: Kamala Harris is the current Vice President and has been working closely with Biden throughout his first term. In most cases, incumbent presidents keep their running mates when seeking re-election, as changing the ticket can be seen as a sign of instability or lack of confidence. Factors supporting Harris's renomination: 1. Continuity and stability of the current administration. 2. Her historic position as the first woman, first Black person, and first person of South Asian descent to be Vice President. 3. Her appeal to key Democratic constituencies. Factors that could lead to a different VP choice: 1. If Biden were to withdraw and Harris became the presidential nominee, a new VP would be chosen. 2. If the Biden campaign decides they need to shake up the ticket to improve their chances of winning.

(a) Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat: This scenario is quite specific and depends on the perception of Biden vs. a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. Historically, incumbent presidents often perform better than generic party candidates in polls. However, given Biden's current approval ratings and age concerns, it's possible that some voters might prefer a generic Democrat over him. Trump, being a known quantity, might benefit from this comparison. Still, a 3% difference is significant. I'd estimate this part has about a 30% chance of occurring. (b) USD being worth >= 145 JPY at close on August 9th, 2024: As of July 2023, the USD/JPY exchange rate is around 144. Predicting currency exchange rates more than a year in advance is highly challenging due to numerous factors including economic policies, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. The yen has been relatively weak against the dollar recently due to divergent monetary policies between the US and Japan. If this trend continues, reaching 145 or higher is plausible. However, a lot can change in a year. I'd estimate this part has about a 55% chance of occurring.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that there will be another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Convention. The incumbent advantage, lack of serious challengers, short time frame, and party unity all point towards a very low probability of a debate occurring.

(a) Another Democratic party presidential debate happening: As of now (July 2024), Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. Typically, when an incumbent president is running for re-election, their party doesn't hold primary debates. However, there are some factors to consider: 1. Biden's age and health concerns have led to some speculation about his candidacy. 2. There are potential challengers like Marianne Williamson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who have announced their candidacies. 3. The Democratic National Convention is still over a month away (August 19-22, 2024).

(a) Another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention: The likelihood of this occurring is very low. Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee. Historically, incumbent presidents rarely face primary challengers or participate in debates within their own party. The Democratic Party has shown strong support for Biden's re-election bid, and there are no significant challengers at this time. Additionally, the time frame is very short, with only about a month between the question's creation date and the resolution date, leaving little time to organize a debate. (b) Joe Biden drops out and a reliable media outlet covers it at least 6 hours in advance: The probability of this happening is also very low. Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election and has not shown any signs of considering dropping out. His campaign is actively fundraising and preparing for the general election. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, the Democratic Party leadership has rallied behind him. For Biden to drop out this close to the convention would be extremely unusual and potentially damaging to the party's chances in the general election. However, we must consider that unexpected events can occur in politics. While highly unlikely, there's always a small chance of a major health issue, personal crisis, or unforeseen scandal that could force Biden to withdraw. The requirement for media coverage 6 hours in advance adds another layer of complexity but is plausible if such an event were to occur. Combining these factors, the overall probability is very low, but not zero. The chance of a debate (part a) is nearly negligible, while the chance of Biden dropping out (part b), while still very unlikely, is slightly higher due to the unpredictable nature of personal and health-related issues.

Iran's recent actions: The April 13, 2024 drone and missile attack by Iran on Israel in response to an earlier strike on Iran's embassy in Syria has significantly heightened tensions between the two countries. 6. Israel's response: Following Iran's attack, Israel has vowed to respond, and there is significant pressure within Israel to retaliate against Iran directly. 7. Escalation risks: A direct attack on Iranian soil with multiple casualties would represent a significant escalation in the conflict, potentially leading to a wider regional war. 8. Strategic considerations: Israel may prefer to focus on more targeted, covert operations or cyber attacks rather than a high-casualty attack within Iran's borders. Given these factors, there is a non-trivial chance that Israel could carry out an attack within Iran before May 1, 2024. The recent Iranian attack on Israel has significantly increased the likelihood of Israeli retaliation. However, the short time frame and the potential for severe consequences may still deter Israel from conducting a large-scale, deadly attack within Iran's borders.

This coalition includes President Emmanuel Macron's party, Renaissance (formerly La R\u00e9publique En Marche!). 2. Time frame: The question asks about the situation on July 30, 2024, which is more than a year from now. A lot can change in French politics during this time. 3. French political system: In France, the President appoints the Prime Minister, who is usually from the party or coalition that holds the majority in the National Assembly. 4. Recent political trends: France has seen increasing political fragmentation, with traditional parties losing ground to newer movements on both the left and right. 5. Potential for political shifts: Given the volatile nature of French politics, there's a possibility of cabinet reshuffles or even early elections that could change the composition of the government. 6. Macron's term: President Macron's second term ends in 2027, so he will still be in office in July 2024. However, his ability to maintain a majority coalition might be challenged. 7. Opposition strength: The New Popular Front (NUPES) is currently the main opposition, but other parties or coalitions could gain strength by 2024. Considering these factors, it seems unlikely but not impossible for a Prime Minister from a coalition other than 'Together' or 'New Popular Front' to be in office by July 2024. The current 'Together' coalition has a plurality in the National Assembly, and while its position could weaken, it would require a significant political shift for a completely different coalition to take power.

The linked market getting at least 377 traders by the end of July 15: - This part has a much shorter timeframe (until July 15, 2024). - The number of traders (377) seems quite specific and high for a prediction market. - Without knowing the current number of traders or the typical growth rate of traders on this platform, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of reaching this number. - The mention of 'market shenanigans' suggests there might be some unusual activity or interest in this market, which could potentially drive up participation.

Kamala Harris choosing Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro as her VP pick: - The resolution date is set for August 6, 2024, which aligns with the reported timeline of Harris choosing before August 7th. - However, it's important to note that Kamala Harris is not currently the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has not indicated he won't run for re-election. - The scenario where Harris would be choosing a VP seems unlikely unless there's a major shift in the Democratic party's plans that we're unaware of. - Even if Harris were to become the nominee, it's too early to predict with certainty who she would choose as a running mate. 2.

Given these considerations, the second part of the question (about reaching 377 traders) seems more likely to occur than the first part (Harris choosing a VP).

Manifold users are likely to be more politically engaged and potentially more informed than the average voter, which could lead to different results. 2. Perception of Joe Biden vs. a generic Democrat: Biden, as the incumbent president, carries both the advantages and disadvantages of his record.

Federal Reserve policy: The Fed has been actively working to bring inflation down to its 2% target. By July 2024, their policies may have had more time to take effect, potentially slowing inflation. 3. Economic conditions: The state of the economy in mid-2024 will play a crucial role. Factors like employment rates, wage growth, and consumer spending will influence inflation. 4. Global factors: International events, supply chain issues, or commodity prices could impact inflation. 5. Seasonal adjustments: July typically doesn't have strong seasonal effects on Core CPI, so this shouldn't be a major factor. 6. Time frame: The question is about July 2024, which is about a year from now. This long time frame increases uncertainty. 7. Core CPI exclusions: Core CPI excludes food and energy prices, which are often more volatile. This makes Core CPI generally more stable, but still subject to changes.

The historical trend supports this, and while the Fed is working to reduce inflation, completely taming it to consistently low levels may take time. However, the long time frame and potential success of Fed policies introduce significant uncertainty."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "051687a2-a49b-416e-a865-b5270efb74c8", "title": "Will Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August?", "body": "Resolves YES if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) invokes Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time).\n\nThe duration of the incapacity does not matter for this question.\n\nBiden exiting the office of the Presidency by death, resignation, etc does not count.

(a) US Core CPI increase in July 2024: The Core CPI (Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy) is a key measure of inflation. Historically, month-over-month increases of more than 0.1% are common. However, predicting specific economic indicators over a year in advance is challenging due to numerous variables that can affect inflation. Recent trends show that the Federal Reserve has been actively working to control inflation, and their efforts might lead to more moderate increases in Core CPI by mid-2024. However, economic conditions can change rapidly, and external factors like global events or policy shifts could impact inflation rates. Given the historical data and the uncertainty of long-term economic predictions, I would estimate the probability of Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024 to be around 0.7 or 70%.

The 25th Amendment has never been invoked in this manner in U.S. history. 2.

Biden's health, while a topic of discussion due to his age, has not shown signs of severe decline that would warrant such an extreme measure. 4. The political ramifications of such an action would be enormous, making it an incredibly high bar for implementation.

However, the Federal Reserve has been actively working to curb inflation, and their efforts might show results by July 2024.

While President Biden is the oldest serving president and concerns about his age and health have been raised, there's no concrete evidence suggesting he's unable to discharge his duties. For this to happen, it would require a significant and sudden decline in Biden's health or mental capacity, as well as agreement from the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet.

Historical data shows that the SENSEX has had annual returns exceeding 15% in some years, but it's not common. Additionally, predicting a specific narrow range (75,000 to 76,000) adds another layer of difficulty. The probability of hitting this exact range is quite low. (b) Manifold market traders: The second part of the question refers to a specific prediction market on Manifold Markets. Without access to the current state of this market or historical data on its growth rate, it's challenging to make a precise estimate. However, reaching 377 traders in a niche prediction market by July 15 seems like a more achievable goal than the specific SENSEX range. Considering both parts together: While each individual condition has a relatively low probability of occurring, the fact that only one needs to be true increases the overall likelihood of a YES resolution. The market trader condition seems more likely to be met than the SENSEX condition, but both are uncertain. Given the information available and the nature of the question, I would estimate a moderate probability for this question resolving YES."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.13629664378903497, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03407416094725874, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5337189844837804, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Age and health: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. While his age has been a topic of discussion, he has maintained that he is fit for office and has regular health check-ups. 3.

Time frame: The question asks about the period up to July 20, 2024, which is before the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). This gives a significant amount of time for potential changes or unforeseen circumstances. 5. Historical precedent: It is extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election race, especially this far in advance. 6.

Considering these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden will drop out before July 20, 2024.

Biden is the incumbent, which typically favors running for re-election. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden is currently 81 years old and would be 86 at the end of a second term. There have been ongoing discussions about his age and fitness for office, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current political climate: As of now, Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee and has been campaigning for re-election. He has not shown any signs of stepping down or declining the nomination. 4. Time frame: The question's resolution date is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention, which is typically held in August. It's unlikely for a sitting president to withdraw so close to the convention without extenuating circumstances. 5. Lack of strong alternative candidates: The Democratic Party hasn't been grooming any clear alternatives to Biden, which suggests they are committed to his candidacy. 6. Biden's public statements: He has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has not indicated any plans to step down. 7.

While age and health concerns are real factors, they don't appear to be severe enough at this time to force such a drastic decision. The political costs of withdrawing so close to the election would be significant, and there's no clear indication that Biden or his team are considering this option.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden between 2 and 3 points on July 15, 2024: As of the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), Trump has a 2.4-point lead over Biden. This is already within the specified range. However, we need to consider potential changes in the next week: 1. Polls can fluctuate quickly, especially in a close race. 2. The specified range (2-3 points) is relatively narrow, making it somewhat less likely to hit exactly. 3. Major events or scandals could shift polls significantly in either direction. 4. Historically, incumbent presidents (in this case, Biden) often see some improvement in polls as the election nears. Given these factors, I'd estimate about a 30% chance of Trump's lead being in this specific range on July 15. (b) CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024: This is more challenging to predict without knowing the current value. However, we can consider some factors: 1. Volatility tends to increase during election years due to uncertainty. 2. Economic conditions, geopolitical events, and market sentiment can all impact volatility. 3. The comparison is year-over-year, so we're looking at relative change rather than absolute levels. 4. The timeframe (one year) is long enough for significant changes to occur. Given these factors, I'd estimate about a 55% chance of the volatility index being higher year-over-year. To resolve YES, either (a) or (b) needs to occur.

This means Nvidia would need to grow substantially while Apple remains stagnant or declines for this to occur. 2. Growth potential: Nvidia has been experiencing rapid growth due to the AI boom and its dominance in GPU technology.

Apple, while a mature company, continues to innovate and has a loyal customer base. Its services segment is growing, which could provide additional value. 3. Market trends: The AI and machine learning markets are expected to continue growing, which could benefit Nvidia. However, there's also a risk of market saturation or competition catching up.

State-by-state variations: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently. Some states might be more inclined to take action against Trump than others. 3. Ongoing legal challenges: There are already efforts underway in some states to challenge Trump's eligibility under the 14th Amendment.

Several states have considered or are considering removing Trump from the ballot based on his actions related to the January 6th Capitol riot. Colorado and Maine have already taken steps to remove him, though these decisions are being challenged in court. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on this issue, with a decision expected in early 2024. Their ruling will likely set a precedent for all states.

Name recognition: Suarez is not widely known on the national stage compared to other potential Republican candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley. Fundraising ability: As a relatively unknown candidate, Suarez may struggle to raise the substantial funds needed for a competitive national campaign. Political experience: Suarez lacks experience at the federal level, which is often seen as crucial for presidential candidates. Current polling: As of now, Suarez is not registering significant support in national polls for the Republican nomination. Competition: The Republican field is likely to be crowded with more established and well-known candidates, making it difficult for a lesser-known candidate to break through. Time until convention: While there is still time until the Republican National Convention in 2024, it would be challenging for Suarez to build the necessary momentum and support in this timeframe. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for a mayor to directly become a major party's presidential nominee without holding higher office first.

If Trump is the Republican nominee, which seems likely at this point, the race could be close. Trump has a strong base of support, but also high unfavorability ratings. Biden narrowly defeated Trump in 2020, and a rematch could be competitive.

Elon Musk's $57 billion package: This is an extraordinarily large compensation package, which is likely to draw scrutiny from proxy advisors like ISS. The size alone increases the likelihood of ISS recommending against it. 3. Corporate governance concerns: ISS typically focuses on good corporate governance practices. Tesla has faced criticism for its board composition, including the presence of Kimbal Musk (Elon's brother) as a board member, which could be seen as compromising independence. 4. Recent legal challenges: A Delaware judge recently ruled that Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package was unfair to shareholders and should be voided.

The recent court ruling on Musk's pay package and ISS's past recommendations make it particularly probable that they will advise against the compensation package.

However, given that the market has about 1.5 months to reach this goal (from the creation date to the resolution date), it seems plausible that it could attract 377 traders, especially if it's a topic of high interest. The specificity of the number (377) suggests it might be based on some existing benchmark or trend. (b) Regarding ISS advising against Elon Musk's $57 billion package or Kimbal Musk's re-election: Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is known for its influential recommendations on corporate governance matters. Given the controversial nature of Elon Musk's compensation package and the criticism around Kimbal Musk's position on the board (often cited as an example of poor corporate governance due to family ties), there's a significant chance that ISS might advise against one or both of these. Historical context is important here: 1. In 2018, ISS recommended against Elon Musk's previous compensation plan, citing its unprecedented size. 2. In 2022, ISS recommended against the re-election of Kimbal Musk to the board, citing a lack of relevant industry experience and questioning his independence.

Marketing and hype: Marvel/Disney are known for their extensive marketing campaigns, which could drive higher opening weekend attendance. 6. Post-pandemic box office trends: While the movie industry has been recovering, some blockbusters have been performing exceptionally well, suggesting audiences are eager for big-screen experiences. 7. Inflation: Box office numbers have generally been trending upward due to inflation, giving newer movies an advantage in raw dollar amounts. 8. Release date: The movie is set to release on July 26, 2024, which is typically a good time for summer blockbusters. 9. Competition: Without knowing the full summer 2024 release schedule, it's hard to gauge competition, but Marvel movies often dominate their opening weekends. Given these factors, especially the combined star power, the MCU integration, and the general upward trend in box office numbers, it seems highly likely that \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" will surpass the $185.5 million mark. The combination of these two popular characters in one film, backed by Disney's marketing machine and the MCU brand, presents a strong case for an exceptionally high opening weekend. However, there's always some uncertainty in box office predictions, and unexpected factors (like poor reviews or unforeseen competition) could impact performance."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "e8fa4d09-ef7c-42d4-9852-da1520ac169a", "title": "Will both (1) Taylor Swift cameo in Deadpool and Wolverine and (2) the domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" be higher than that of \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine\" combined?", "body": "(1) Resolves YES if Taylor Swift appears in the movie \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" in any role, even if it is just her voice used for a character.

Taylor Swift cameo in Deadpool and Wolverine: Taylor Swift is known to be good friends with Ryan Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively. She has also shown interest in acting, having appeared in films like 'Valentine's Day' and 'Cats.' Given the playful nature of the Deadpool franchise and its tendency to include unexpected cameos, it's not implausible that Swift could make an appearance. However, there's no concrete evidence or rumors suggesting her involvement in the film. The probability of this happening is relatively low, but not impossible. Let's estimate this at about 20%. 2. Box office opening higher than Deadpool and The Wolverine combined: The target to beat is $185,548,391. Several factors support a high opening: - Deadpool and Wolverine are both very popular characters with established fanbases. - This film brings them together for the first time, which is likely to generate significant buzz. - The Marvel Cinematic Universe connection could attract a broader audience. - The previous Deadpool film already surpassed this number on its own. However, we should also consider potential challenges: - The box office has been somewhat unpredictable post-pandemic. - Superhero fatigue could potentially impact numbers. Given these factors, the probability of surpassing the combined box office seems quite high, perhaps around 80%. For the overall question to resolve as YES, both of these events need to occur. We calculate this by multiplying the probabilities: 0.20 * 0.80 = 0.16 or 16%.

(a) Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4: This is an extremely rare event that has never been invoked in U.S. history. For this to occur, there would need to be a severe decline in Biden's cognitive or physical health, to the point where he is unable to discharge his duties, and the Vice President and Cabinet would need to agree on this assessment. While there have been concerns about Biden's age and occasional gaffes, there is no concrete evidence of severe incapacitation. The administration and Democratic Party would likely resist such a move unless absolutely necessary, as it would be politically damaging. The probability of this occurring in the next year is very low. (b) Joe Biden dies before August 2024: Biden is currently 80 years old (born November 20, 1942). While his age does increase the risk of mortality, he has access to excellent healthcare and appears to be in relatively good health for his age. According to actuarial tables, the annual mortality rate for an 80-year-old male in the U.S. is approximately 5.6%. However, this is for the average population, and Biden likely has better odds due to his access to top-tier medical care. Combining these factors: The probability of scenario (a) is extremely low, likely less than 1%. The probability of scenario (b) is higher but still relatively low, perhaps around 4-5% for the given timeframe. Since we only need one of these events to occur for the question to resolve YES, we need to combine these probabilities. However, they are not simply additive as there is a small chance of overlap (i.e., Biden could be declared incapacitated and then die).

While there's been progress, there are also significant challenges: - Many countries have expressed concerns about sovereignty and the treaty's potential impact on national decision-making. - The negotiation process has been complex and time-consuming. - The target date for adoption has already been pushed back once from May 2023 to May 2024. Given these factors, while it's possible the agreement could be approved in May 2024, it seems more likely that further negotiations or delays might occur. I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 40%. 2. OpenAI publicly committing to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle: Several factors to consider: - The AI safety community has been increasingly vocal about the need for such principles. - OpenAI has shown some willingness to engage with safety concerns in the past. - The timeframe (before July 1, 2024) gives OpenAI ample time to make such a commitment. - However, companies are often reluctant to make binding commitments that could potentially limit their actions. - The requirement for verification by Metaculus and satisfaction of righttowarn.ai members adds an additional hurdle. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 30%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.40 + 0.30 - (0.40 * 0.30) = 0.58.

Competition: While other nations have improved in basketball, the U.S. still remains the favorite in both categories. However, teams like Spain, Australia, and Serbia for men, and Australia, Spain, and Japan for women have shown they can compete at a high level. 5. Preparation: The U.S. teams typically have less time to prepare together compared to other national teams, which can sometimes lead to early tournament struggles. 6.

(a) Team USA winning both Men's and Women's 5v5 basketball gold medals at the Paris Olympics: Team USA has a strong history in Olympic basketball. The women's team has been particularly dominant, winning the last seven consecutive Olympic gold medals (1996-2021). The men's team has won four consecutive gold medals (2008-2021), with their last non-gold finish being bronze in 2004.

The men's team, while still favored, faces stiffer competition from other nations that have been improving in recent years. Their chances might be around 70-75%. The probability of both teams winning gold would be the product of their individual probabilities. Let's estimate this at approximately 0.90 * 0.75 = 0.675 or 67.5%.

For example: - 2016 Rio Olympics: 27 world records - 2012 London Olympics: 32 world records - 2008 Beijing Olympics: 43 world records The trend shows a decrease in the number of world records broken per Olympics. However, advancements in training, technology, and the excitement of the Paris Olympics could lead to more record-breaking performances. The threshold of 24 is achievable but not guaranteed. 2.

However, host nations often perform better due to increased funding, home advantage, and motivation. For example: - UK in 2012: 3rd place - Brazil in 2016: 13th place (up from 22nd in 2012) - Japan in 2020: 3rd place France has a strong sporting culture and will likely invest heavily in preparation for the home Olympics. This significantly increases their chances of reaching the top 5. Combining the probabilities: For both conditions to be met, we need both events to occur. The probability of breaking 24 world records seems moderately high, perhaps around 60%. The probability of France reaching the top 5 also seems increased due to the home advantage, perhaps around 70%. However, these events are not entirely independent.

The number can vary significantly between Olympics, often depending on factors like new technologies in equipment or advancements in training methods. While 24 is a high number, it's not unprecedented. However, as records become harder to break over time, achieving 24 broken records might be challenging. 2. France placing in the Top 5: France has not finished in the top 5 of the medal table in recent Summer Olympics. In Tokyo 2020, they finished 8th. In Rio 2016, they were 7th. However, being the host country often provides a significant advantage. Host nations typically invest more in athlete preparation and benefit from home crowd support. For example, Great Britain jumped from 4th in Beijing 2008 to 3rd in London 2012, and Japan improved from 6th in Rio 2016 to 3rd in Tokyo 2020.

Historical context indicates that the US has been experiencing elevated inflation rates over the past couple of years, though it has shown signs of moderating in recent months. The Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is a more stable measure of underlying inflation trends. In the past year, month-over-month Core CPI increases have often exceeded 0.1%, but there have been months with lower increases as well. The Federal Reserve has been implementing aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation, and these actions typically take time to fully impact the economy and inflation rates. Economic conditions, such as labor market tightness, supply chain issues, and consumer demand, can also influence inflation rates. While the question specifies seasonally adjusted data, there might still be some residual seasonal effects in July. Given that the question is about July 2024, which is about a year from now, this adds significant uncertainty to the forecast. However, historical data suggests that month-over-month increases exceeding 0.1% are quite common, even in periods of more moderate inflation.

(b) Month-over-Month US Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July: Core CPI (excluding food and energy) tends to be more stable than overall CPI.

While tech stocks can be volatile, such a drastic drop without a major catastrophic event is improbable. 2. US Core CPI increase by more than 0.1% in July: The Core CPI (Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy) is a key measure of inflation. In recent months, inflation has been moderating in the US, but it's still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The question is about July 2024, which is a year from now. It's difficult to predict inflation that far in advance, but we can make some educated guesses: - The Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation. - By July 2024, these measures will have had more time to take effect. - However, core inflation tends to be sticky and slow to change. - In recent months, core CPI has been increasing by around 0.2-0.4% month-over-month.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden between 2 and 3 points on July 15, 2024: As of now (2023), it's difficult to predict polling numbers for a specific date over a year in advance. However, we can consider current trends and historical data: 1. Trump and Biden are likely to be the nominees for their respective parties. 2. Recent polls have shown a close race, with leads often within a few percentage points. 3. The specific range (2-3 points) is quite narrow, making it less likely to occur on that exact date. 4. Polling averages tend to fluctuate, especially as we get closer to the election. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this specific scenario at around 15-20%. (b) A Trump family member as the Republican nominee: 1. Donald Trump is currently the front-runner for the Republican nomination. 2. Other Trump family members have not indicated serious intentions to run. 3. The Republican party has shown strong support for Donald Trump. 4. There's still time for unexpected events to occur before the nomination. Considering these points, I'd estimate the probability of a Trump family member (most likely Donald Trump himself) being the nominee at around 70-75%. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves YES if either (a) or (b) occurs. Using the probability of either event occurring formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Assuming the events are independent (which is a reasonable assumption): P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Let's use the middle of our ranges: 17.5% for (a) and 72.5% for (b). P(YES) = 0.175 + 0.725 - (0.175 * 0.725) = 0.900 - 0.127 = 0.773.

Current polling trends: As of July 5, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points according to 538's national polling average. This is within the range specified in the question (between 2 and 4 points). 2. Time frame: We're looking at the polling average on July 15, 2024, which is only 10 days from the current data point. This is a relatively short period in political polling, suggesting that dramatic shifts are less likely. 3. Historical volatility: Presidential polling averages tend to fluctuate, but major shifts often occur over longer periods unless there are significant events. 4. Potential events: We should consider the possibility of major events occurring between July 5 and July 15 that could significantly impact the polls. However, without specific information about such events, we should assume relative stability. 5. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points, which means small fluctuations are common and expected. 6. Trend direction: If there's a slight trend favoring Trump, it could push his lead further into the specified range. 7. Regression to the mean: There's often a tendency for polling numbers to move back towards historical averages over time. Given these factors, it seems reasonably likely that Trump's lead will remain within the specified range. The current 2.4-point lead is already within the range, and while it could move outside this range, the short timeframe and typical polling stability suggest it's more likely to stay within or near this range. However, we must also consider the possibility of the lead falling below 2 points or rising above 4 points. Given the current 2.4-point lead, there's a higher chance of it falling below 2 than rising above 4.

If we assume a linear growth rate, the market would need to attract about 7 new traders per day (78 traders / 11 days) to reach the goal. 4. Market visibility and appeal: The market is embedded in another platform (Manifold Markets), which could increase its visibility. However, the specific topic of the embedded market is not provided, so we can't assess its potential appeal. 5. Creator's influence: The creator mentions \"extremely loyal followers,\" suggesting they might have some ability to attract traders. However, they also mention being \"embroiled in some market shenanigans,\" which could either attract or deter potential traders. 6.

Given these factors, reaching 377 traders seems challenging but not impossible. The need for about 7 new traders per day is significant, especially considering that market participation often follows a pattern of initial surge followed by slower growth. However, the creator's apparent following and the potential for increased visibility due to the market's meta nature (a market about a market) could drive interest.
