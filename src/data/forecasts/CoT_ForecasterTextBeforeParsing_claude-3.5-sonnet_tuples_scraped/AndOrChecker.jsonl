Donald Trump Jr. has not announced any intention to run. 2. Name recognition: While Donald Trump Jr. has a high profile due to his father's presidency, he has never held elected office himself, which could be a significant disadvantage. 3. Political experience: Compared to other potential candidates, Donald Trump Jr. lacks direct political experience, which voters and party officials often consider important for a presidential nominee. 4. Family dynasty concerns: There might be hesitation within the Republican Party to nominate another Trump family member so soon after Donald Trump Sr.'s presidency, as it could be seen as promoting a political dynasty. 5. Base support: While Donald Trump Jr. is popular among his father's base, it's unclear if he could expand that support to win a primary contest against more experienced politicians. 6. Timing: With the resolution date set for August 1, 2024, there is still time for unexpected developments. However, candidates typically announce their intentions well in advance, and Donald Trump Jr. has not indicated any plans to run. 7. Party dynamics: The Republican Party may be looking for a candidate who can unite different factions within the party and appeal to a broader electorate in the general election. 8. Legal considerations: Any ongoing investigations or legal issues involving the Trump family could potentially impact Donald Trump Jr.'s viability as a candidate. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Donald Trump Jr. will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Policy positions: Hutchinson's more moderate stance on some issues may not align well with the current Republican base, which tends to favor more conservative positions. 6. Trump factor: The influence of Donald Trump on the Republican Party remains significant. Hutchinson has been critical of Trump, which could alienate a large portion of the Republican base. 7. Time until convention: While there is still time until the Republican National Convention in 2024, Hutchinson would need to make significant gains in popularity and support to become a serious contender. 8.

Pence's appeal: While Pence has experience as Vice President and Governor of Indiana, he lacks the charisma and broad appeal that typically characterizes successful presidential candidates. His conservative stance might appeal to some Republicans but may not be enough to secure the nomination. 4.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history.

Let's analyze each part separately: (a) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024: As of now (July 2024), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election. It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of the race, especially this close to the election. Biden has been actively campaigning and fundraising, and there are no strong indications that he's considering stepping aside. While his age and approval ratings have been topics of discussion, the Democratic Party has not shown any significant push to replace him. The likelihood of Biden making such an announcement in the next two weeks is very low. (b) Kamala Harris's odds of winning increasing over the next week according to Nate Silver's model: This part is more challenging to predict without current data from Nate Silver's model. However, we can make some educated guesses: 1. Harris is currently the Vice President, and her chances of winning the presidency are typically tied to Biden's performance and decisions. 2. For her odds to increase significantly (to over 46.6%) in just one week, there would likely need to be a major event or announcement affecting Biden's candidacy. 3. Given that we've already established that Biden is unlikely to drop out, such a dramatic shift in Harris's odds seems improbable. 4. Nate Silver's models are generally quite stable and don't tend to show large swings without significant new information or events. Considering both parts together, the probability of either event occurring is still quite low.

(a) Joe Biden dying before July 26th, 2024: Joe Biden is currently 80 years old (born November 20, 1942). While he is in generally good health for his age, the mortality risk for individuals in their early 80s is not negligible. According to actuarial tables, the annual mortality rate for an 80-year-old male in the US is around 5.5%. However, Biden likely has access to excellent healthcare, which may reduce this risk somewhat. The timeframe from now until July 26th, 2024 is about one year, so we can use this annual mortality rate as a rough estimate. (b) Biden not remaining President through the end of July 2024: This part encompasses more possibilities, including resignation, impeachment, or other reasons for leaving office. Biden has not shown any indication of planning to resign, and there are currently no serious impeachment efforts against him. However, political situations can change rapidly, and health issues could potentially lead to a resignation. The probability of this occurring is likely higher than the probability of death alone, but still relatively low given Biden's apparent commitment to his role and the stability of his administration. Combining these factors: The probability of (a) occurring is roughly 5.5% based on actuarial tables, but let's adjust it down to about 4% considering Biden's access to healthcare. The probability of (b) occurring is harder to quantify but is likely somewhat higher than (a). Let's estimate it at about 7%, which includes the possibility of death as well as other reasons for leaving office. Since the question resolves YES if either (a) or (b) occurs, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of these events happening. The probability of neither event occurring is (1 - 0.04) * (1 - 0.07) = 0.8928, or 89.28%.

However, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned this decision in March 2024, ruling that states cannot unilaterally disqualify candidates for federal office under the 14th Amendment. 2. Supreme Court ruling impact: The Supreme Court's decision sets a strong precedent that makes it significantly less likely for any state to successfully remove Trump from their primary ballot under the 14th Amendment. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is after the primary season for most states. By this time, most primaries will have already taken place, reducing the likelihood of new attempts to remove Trump from ballots. 4. Political climate: Despite the legal setbacks, there remains strong opposition to Trump's candidacy among some groups, which could potentially lead to further attempts to block his candidacy through other means. 5. Other legal challenges: While the 14th Amendment route has been largely closed off, Trump faces other legal challenges that could potentially impact his candidacy. However, these are not relevant to this specific question. 6. State-level actions: The question only requires one state to remove or block Trump from the ballot. However, given the Supreme Court's ruling, it's highly unlikely that any state would attempt this again, as it would likely be quickly overturned.

While there have been efforts to invoke the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running for office due to his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot, it's far from certain that these efforts will succeed. Several factors to consider: 1. Legal challenges: Any attempt to remove Trump from the ballot would likely face immediate and vigorous legal challenges. 2. State-by-state basis: The question only requires one state to remove or block Trump, which increases the likelihood. 3. Political implications: States might be hesitant to take such a controversial step due to potential backlash. 4.

(a) Donald Trump being removed from a primary ballot under the 14th Amendment: This scenario has gained some traction recently, with legal scholars and some politicians arguing that Trump's actions related to the January 6th Capitol riot could disqualify him under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. However, there are several factors to consider: 1. Legal uncertainty: The application of the 14th Amendment in this context is unprecedented and would likely face significant legal challenges. 2. Political resistance: Many Republicans would strongly oppose such a move, potentially influencing decision-makers. 3. Time constraints: The deadline is July 15, 2024, which gives time for legal battles but also increases uncertainty. 4. State-by-state basis: Even if one state removes Trump, others may not follow suit. Given these factors, while there's a possibility of this occurring, it seems unlikely. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 15%. (b) Ted Cruz being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: This scenario seems even less likely for several reasons: 1. Current polling: Trump is currently the frontrunner for the Republican nomination by a significant margin. 2. Cruz's position: He's not currently a declared candidate for the 2024 election. 3. Party dynamics: The Republican establishment, while sometimes at odds with Trump, has not shown a strong preference for Cruz. 4. Historical precedent: It's rare for a party to nominate someone who isn't actively campaigning. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Cruz becoming the nominee at around 2%. Combining these probabilities, and accounting for the fact that only one needs to occur for a 'Yes' resolution, we can use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

Party dynamics: The Republican Party might be looking for a candidate who can appeal to a broader electorate, which could work against Trump Jr. 6. Time until convention: There is still significant time until the 2024 Republican National Convention, and the political landscape could change dramatically. 7. Legal issues: Both Donald Trump Sr. and Jr. have been involved in various legal controversies, which could impact their political futures. 8. Precedent: It's highly unusual for a major party to nominate the child of a former president as their candidate, especially when that former president is still politically active. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Donald Trump Jr. will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. While not impossible, it would require a series of unlikely events, such as his father dropping out of the race and endorsing him, other major candidates faltering, and a significant shift in party dynamics."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "efa7fb4f-5cd9-406c-98e9-8282aa83d6c6", "title": "Will Chris Christie be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Chris Christie is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Experience and recognition: While Nikki Haley has more national recognition as a former UN Ambassador and governor of South Carolina, Francis Suarez is relatively unknown outside of Florida. 5. Historical precedent: It's rare for candidates polling so low this far out from the convention to surge and win the nomination. 6. Time until convention: There is still time for dynamics to change, but it would require a significant shift in the political landscape or major scandals affecting the frontrunners. 7. Delegate math: The Republican primary system tends to favor frontrunners, making it difficult for lower-polling candidates to gain momentum. 8. Potential for dropouts: There's a possibility that either Suarez or Haley (or both) may drop out before the convention if their campaigns fail to gain traction. Given these factors, the chances of either Suarez or Haley winning the nomination appear quite low. Haley has a slightly better chance than Suarez due to her higher national profile, but both are significant underdogs compared to Trump and DeSantis.

At least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early: This seems somewhat likely given the context provided. The Politico article suggests that 'dozens' of House Democrats are organizing to speak out against the early nomination plan. Rep. Jared Huffman is circulating a draft letter, which indicates there's already some momentum behind this effort. However, we don't know exactly how many will ultimately sign. The threshold of 20 is not extremely high, considering there are currently 213 Democratic Representatives and 48 Democratic Senators (plus 3 Independents who caucus with Democrats). Given the apparent discontent and the relatively low threshold, this part seems fairly likely. 2. 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20: This is a much more extreme and unlikely scenario. Calling for a sitting president of one's own party to drop out is a very significant step that could have major political consequences. As of now, there's no indication that any Democratic Senators are publicly considering such a move. Biden, despite some concerns about his age and popularity, is still the incumbent president and the presumptive nominee. For 10 Senators (over 20% of the Democratic caucus) to call for his withdrawal would be unprecedented and highly disruptive to the party. Combining these two events, the overall probability becomes quite low. While the first event seems reasonably possible, the second is highly unlikely. For both to occur, we would need to see a dramatic and rapid shift in the Democratic Party's stance towards Biden, which doesn't seem probable given the current political landscape and the short timeframe (until July 20)."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "8a5568a5-be1c-4729-b1b6-e744a45fed31", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early?

Time until the convention: With the Republican National Convention still over a year away, there's ample time for the political landscape to shift dramatically. Unforeseen events or scandals could significantly impact candidates' chances. 6. Trump's legal issues: Ongoing legal challenges facing Trump could potentially impact his ability to run or his popularity among voters, which could benefit other candidates like DeSantis or Cruz. 7. Party dynamics: The Republican Party's internal dynamics and the preferences of key donors and influencers will play a crucial role in determining the nominee. Considering these factors, Ron DeSantis appears to have a stronger chance than Ted Cruz of securing the nomination if Trump doesn't run or loses support. However, Trump's current frontrunner status significantly reduces the likelihood of either Cruz or DeSantis becoming the nominee. Given the current political climate and polling data, I would estimate that there's roughly a 30-35% chance that either Cruz or DeSantis becomes the Republican nominee. This takes into account the possibility of Trump's candidacy faltering and the potential for one of these two candidates (more likely DeSantis) to emerge as the party's choice."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.000866067758187837, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.00021651693954695926, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.07211464655183289, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given these factors, Belgium appears to have a better chance of qualifying than Latvia based on recent history. For both countries to qualify, we would need Latvia to break its non-qualification streak and Belgium to maintain its relatively good performance. The probability of both qualifying is lower than either country qualifying individually. If we assume Belgium has about a 60% chance of qualifying (based on recent performance) and Latvia has about a 30% chance (being optimistic about a potential improvement), the probability of both qualifying would be the product of these individual probabilities.

Belgium has had slightly better success historically and more recently than Latvia. However, Eurovision results can be unpredictable, and a strong entry from either country could lead to qualification.

Current status: As of now (July 2023), Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024 and has begun campaigning. 3. Age and health concerns: Biden is currently 80 years old and would be 82 at the start of a second term. While his health appears stable, concerns about his age persist. 4. Approval ratings: Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, but not catastrophically so. They could potentially improve before the election. 5. Democratic Party support: Despite some concerns, the Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden's re-election bid. 6. Lack of strong alternatives: There are no clear frontrunners within the Democratic Party who could easily replace Biden as the nominee. 7. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely for an incumbent to wait this long to make such a significant announcement. 8. Historical precedent: The last incumbent president to not seek re-election was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, and that was under very different circumstances. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he won't accept the nomination.

Biden's age and health: At 80 years old, Biden is already the oldest serving president in U.S. history. Concerns about his age and fitness for office could potentially lead to internal party pressure for him to step aside. 3.

This timing makes it unlikely for such drastic changes to occur so close to the convention. 5. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election campaign, especially this close to the election. 6. Party unity: Democrats are likely to prioritize party unity in the face of a challenging election, making it less likely for a group of lawmakers to publicly pressure Biden to step aside. 7. Lack of clear alternative: There's no clear consensus alternative candidate who could step in if Biden were to drop out, which reduces the likelihood of internal party pressure. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for either of these scenarios to occur, it seems highly unlikely. The Democratic Party is more likely to rally behind Biden, despite any concerns, than to risk the chaos of a last-minute candidate change.

(a) Joe Biden dying before Saturday, July 27th, 2024: Joe Biden is currently 81 years old (born in 1942). While his age puts him at higher risk of health issues, he appears to be in relatively good health for his age. The probability of any person dying within a specific 3-week period is generally low, even for someone in their 80s. Without any specific health concerns reported, the chance of this happening is quite small. (b) The 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee being a Woman: As of now (July 2024), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election. While there have been calls for younger candidates, Biden has not indicated any intention to step down. The Democratic Party has shown strong support for Biden's re-election bid. However, if Biden were to unexpectedly withdraw or be unable to run, there are several prominent female Democrats who could potentially become the nominee, such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, or Amy Klobuchar. In such a scenario, there would be a significant chance of a woman becoming the nominee, but this scenario itself is unlikely given Biden's current position. Combining these factors: The probability of (a) is very low, likely less than 1%. The probability of (b) is also low, but slightly higher, perhaps around 5-10% considering the possibility of unforeseen circumstances leading to Biden's withdrawal and a female candidate taking his place. Since the question asks if EITHER of these will occur, we need to combine these probabilities. The probability of at least one of these events occurring is higher than either individual probability, but still relatively low given the current political landscape and Biden's health status."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.01475847360219603, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0036896184005490076, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17619020168705962, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Strategic importance: Chasiv Yar is considered a gateway to larger cities in the Donetsk region, making it a valuable target for Russian forces. 3. Time frame: The question resolves on June 1, 2024, which is about 13 months from now. This is a significant amount of time in terms of military operations. 4. Recent trends: The war has been characterized by slow, grinding advances and occasional successful counteroffensives. Neither side has made rapid, large-scale gains in recent months. 5. Russian objectives: Capturing Donetsk Oblast remains a key goal for Russia, and taking Chasiv Yar would be a step towards that objective. 6. Ukrainian defenses: Ukraine has been fortifying its positions and has shown resilience in defending key areas. 7. International support: Continued Western support for Ukraine could influence its ability to hold the line or even push back Russian forces. 8. Russian resources: Russia has shown a willingness to commit significant resources to the war, but also faces challenges in terms of manpower and equipment. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that Russia could capture Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024, but it's far from certain. The time frame allows for potential Russian advances, but also for Ukrainian resistance and possible counteroffensives. The strategic importance of the town means Russia is likely to continue targeting it, but Ukraine will also prioritize its defense.

Incumbency advantage: Historically, sitting presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless facing significant health issues or extreme unpopularity. Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Current intentions: Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He officially launched his campaign on April 25, 2023, which is a strong indicator of his commitment to seeking a second term. 3.

Party support: Despite some concerns about his age, Biden still enjoys significant support from the Democratic Party establishment. There's no clear alternative candidate who could unite the party as effectively. 5. Political landscape: The Republican field is still taking shape, with Donald Trump as a frontrunner. The Democrats may see Biden as their best chance to defeat Trump or another Republican nominee. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's highly unlikely for a sitting president to withdraw so late in the process without extraordinary circumstances. 7. Recent precedent: No incumbent president has declined to seek re-election since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, and that was under very different circumstances.

Evidence of potential witness tampering: There have been reports and allegations of Trump attempting to influence witnesses in various investigations. For example, in January 2022, he was accused of trying to influence Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to 'find' votes. 3. Ongoing investigation: The Georgia case is still active, and prosecutors are known to be examining Trump's actions and communications related to the 2020 election. 4. Timeframe: The question gives a deadline of June 1, 2024, which is over a year away. This provides ample time for investigators to gather evidence and for prosecutors to bring charges if warranted. 5. Precedent: While it's rare for a former president to face criminal charges, the fact that Trump has already been indicted in other cases (e.g., the classified documents case in Florida) shows that prosecutors are willing to pursue charges against him. 6.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. It would be highly unusual and politically disruptive for an incumbent president to withdraw from the race, especially this late in the election cycle.

Competition: The Republican field is likely to be crowded with more established politicians. Figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, and Nikki Haley have much higher national profiles and stronger bases of support within the party. 3. Fundraising: While Ramaswamy has personal wealth, he may struggle to match the fundraising capabilities of more established candidates who have extensive donor networks. 4. Policy positions: Ramaswamy's views align with many conservative principles, which could appeal to the Republican base. However, his lack of political experience may raise questions about his ability to implement these ideas effectively. 5. Media attention: He has received some media coverage, but it's significantly less than that of front-runners like Trump or DeSantis. 6. Party establishment support: As a political outsider, Ramaswamy may struggle to gain support from the Republican party establishment, which often plays a crucial role in the nomination process. 7. Time until convention: With the convention still over a year away, there is time for Ramaswamy to build his profile and support. However, this also gives time for other candidates to consolidate their positions. 8. Historical precedent: It's rare for a political newcomer with no prior elected office to secure a major party nomination, though not impossible (as demonstrated by Trump in 2016). Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Ramaswamy to secure the nomination, it appears highly unlikely. He faces significant challenges in terms of name recognition, political experience, and party support compared to other potential candidates."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "a8b01e6e-7dc3-42cb-8641-fd7755314993", "title": "Will Rishi Sunak fail to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if for any reason Rishi Sunak fails to be elected as a Member of Parliament in the July 4 2024 UK general election.\n\nIf Sunak is elected as a Member of Parliament for any constituency in the July 4 2024 UK general election, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nResolution should cite [credible](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) media reports, or an official announcement from the returning officer of the constituency in which Sunak is a candidate (if he is a candidate in any constituency).", "resolution_date": "2024-07-04T22:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-02-22T16:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.03, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of Rishi Sunak failing to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election, we need to consider several factors: 1.

This is a relatively short timeframe for such a significant trade decision, especially considering that the investigation is not set to conclude until after this date. 4. Political pressure: There is increasing pressure from European automakers and some EU member states to protect the domestic EV industry from Chinese competition. 5. Potential retaliation: The EU must consider the risk of retaliation from China, which could impact other sectors of EU-China trade. 6. Global economic conditions: The current economic climate and any changes in the coming months could influence the EU's decision on whether to impose new tariffs. 7.

(a) EU announcing new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024: The EU has been concerned about the influx of cheaper Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years. There's an ongoing investigation into whether Chinese EV manufacturers are benefiting from unfair subsidies. The European Commission launched this probe in September 2023, and it's expected to conclude by November 2024. However, preliminary findings could lead to earlier action. Given the EU's protectionist tendencies and the pressure from European automakers, there's a significant chance that the EU might announce new tariffs before July 2024.

(b) At least 5 named Democratic House Members or Senators pressuring Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024: This scenario is less likely. Despite concerns about Biden's age and some polls showing low approval ratings, the Democratic Party has largely rallied behind Biden for the 2024 election. There's a strong tradition in U.S. politics of supporting the incumbent president for re-election. However, if Biden's poll numbers were to significantly worsen or if there were a major gaffe or health concern, some Democrats might consider asking him to step aside. But for five or more to do so publicly and collectively would be extraordinary and potentially damaging to the party. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 15%.

Let's break it down: 1. Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024: This is a very specific range for Trump's lead. While current polls show Trump with a slight lead, predicting such a precise margin over a year in advance is challenging. Polls can fluctuate significantly, and many factors can influence them between now and July 2024. The probability of hitting this exact range is relatively low, perhaps around 15-20%. 2. Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination: This is highly unlikely. Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election and has already launched his 2024 campaign. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for him to step aside, he and his team have repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to running. For Biden to reverse course and decline the nomination would be a major political shock. The probability of this happening is very low, perhaps around 5-10%. For both of these events to occur simultaneously, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. Even if we take the higher estimates for each event (20% for the polling condition and 10% for Biden's withdrawal), the combined probability would be 0.20 * 0.10 = 0.02 or 2%. However, it's worth noting that these events are not entirely independent. If Biden were to announce he's not accepting the nomination, it could potentially affect Trump's polling numbers.

However, recent polls have shown a close race between Trump and Biden, with some polls giving Trump a slight lead. The specific range of 2-3 points is quite narrow, which makes it less likely to occur.

However, there are concerns about his age (he would be 82 at the start of a second term) and his approval ratings have been relatively low. Despite these factors, it's still unlikely that he would withdraw before the nomination. Presidents rarely decline to run for a second term, and the Democratic Party doesn't have a clear alternative candidate. The probability of this occurring is low, perhaps around 15%. (b) A Trump family member being the Republican nominee: Donald Trump is currently the front-runner for the Republican nomination, despite his legal challenges. He has a strong base of support within the Republican Party and has consistently led in primary polls. Other Trump family members have much lower profiles in terms of political ambitions, making their nominations highly unlikely. The probability of Donald Trump securing the nomination is quite high, perhaps around 70%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of either of two events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), and assuming the events are independent: P(YES) = P(Biden withdraws) + P(Trump family nominee) - P(Both occur) \u2248 0.15 + 0.70 - (0.15 * 0.70) \u2248 0.85 - 0.105 \u2248 0.745.

Biden has expressed his intention to run for re-election in 2024, which suggests he plans to complete his current term. 4.

Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in several states to remove Trump from the ballot using the 14th Amendment.

Political climate: The use of the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump is highly controversial and politically charged. It's likely to face significant opposition from Republican-controlled state governments and Trump supporters. 5. Supreme Court involvement: Given the high-stakes nature of this issue, it's likely that any successful attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would be quickly appealed to the Supreme Court. The current conservative majority on the Court might be skeptical of such an interpretation of the 14th Amendment. 6. State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently, increasing the chances that at least one state might remove Trump from the ballot. 7.

Barring any unforeseen circumstances, it is highly likely that he will remain President through July 2024.

Current political landscape: As of now, Kamala Harris is the incumbent Vice President, and Joe Biden is expected to run for re-election in 2024. It's highly unusual for a sitting Vice President to choose a new running mate unless there are extraordinary circumstances. 2. Timing: The question states that Kamala will choose before August 7th, 2024. This is very close to the Democratic National Convention, which typically occurs in August of election years. However, it's important to note that incumbent presidents rarely change their running mates. 3. Candidates mentioned: a) Mark Kelly: A former astronaut and current U.S. Senator from Arizona. He's a moderate Democrat with a strong background in science and the military. b) Josh Shapiro: The current Governor of Pennsylvania, a key swing state. He has a strong record as Attorney General and won his gubernatorial race decisively. 4. Historical precedent: In modern U.S. politics, it's extremely rare for an incumbent president to change their vice presidential running mate. The last time this happened was in 1976 when Gerald Ford replaced Nelson Rockefeller with Bob Dole. 5. Current administration dynamics: There have been no significant indications of a rift between President Biden and Vice President Harris that would necessitate a change in the ticket. 6. Media speculation: While there may be media speculation about potential VP picks, it's important to note that such speculation is often unreliable, especially when dealing with an incumbent administration. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that Kamala Harris would be in a position to choose a new running mate for the 2024 election. The question appears to be based on a premise that is unlikely to occur - namely, that Harris would be selecting a running mate at all. The only scenario where this could happen is if there was a major, unexpected change in the current administration, such as President Biden deciding not to run for re-election and Harris becoming the presidential nominee. However, there are no credible indications of such a dramatic shift at this time. Therefore, the probability of the question resolving YES (Harris choosing either Kelly or Shapiro) is extremely low.

However, his approval ratings have been low, and there are concerns about his age and fitness for office. Trump, on the other hand, faces legal challenges but maintains a strong base of support. Given the volatility of politics and the long time until July 2024, it's difficult to predict with certainty. However, incumbency advantage and the tendency of 538 to favor more establishment candidates slightly increase the likelihood of Biden being the favorite. I'd estimate this at about 60% chance.

While both Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are rising stars in the Democratic Party, there are many other potential candidates Harris might consider. The pool of potential running mates is usually quite large, and the selection process considers many factors including geographical balance, ideological alignment, and complementary strengths. Given that only two specific individuals are mentioned, and there are many other possible choices, I'd estimate the probability of Harris choosing either Kelly or Shapiro at about 20%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to consider that these events are not entirely independent.

While sprinting times have been improving over the years, progress at the elite level is incremental. The current world record is 9.58s (also by Bolt), set in 2009. In the past decade, no one has come close to breaking Bolt's records. The fastest time in recent years was 9.76s by Christian Coleman in 2019.

Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals: This condition is highly dependent on geopolitical factors, particularly regarding Russia's participation in the Olympics. As of now, Russian and Belarusian athletes are banned from competing under their national flags due to the invasion of Ukraine. If this ban continues, they may compete as neutral athletes. Russia typically wins a significant number of gold medals (20-30) in recent Summer Olympics. However, competing as neutral athletes might affect performance and participation. Additionally, not all Russian athletes may be allowed to compete. Considering these factors, winning 15 or more gold medals as neutral athletes is possible but challenging.

However, we must also consider potential factors that could lead to a change: 1. Harris's approval ratings have been lower than Biden's at times, which could theoretically prompt a strategic change. 2. Unforeseen events or scandals could emerge that might necessitate a change, although this seems unlikely given the time Harris has already served without major issues. 3. Biden could decide not to run for re-election, which could open up the field for a new ticket entirely, though this scenario seems increasingly unlikely given his public statements. Considering all these factors, the probability of Kamala Harris being the Democratic VP nominee again is very high. While not absolutely certain, the combination of incumbency advantage, party unity considerations, and lack of compelling reasons for change make it highly likely that she will remain on the ticket."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "91d7d49e-b5a5-4dad-af04-1b10b7b9f542", "title": "Will Larry Elder be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

For Nvidia to surpass Apple in less than a year, it would require extraordinary growth from Nvidia or a significant decline from Apple. While Nvidia has been growing rapidly due to AI advancements, overtaking Apple in such a short timeframe seems unlikely. However, the tech market can be volatile, so it's not impossible.

Nature of swimming events: Swimming has many events (different strokes, distances, and relays) allowing talented swimmers to compete in multiple races and potentially win multiple medals. 3. Current swimming stars: We need to consider the current swimming landscape. Caeleb Dressel (USA) won five gold medals in Tokyo 2020, showing the potential for swimmers to dominate. Other swimmers like Katie Ledecky (USA) and Adam Peaty (GBR) have also shown consistent excellence. 4. Competition from other sports: Track and field athletes, particularly sprinters and distance runners, can also win multiple medals. Gymnasts, especially in women's events, have the potential to win multiple golds as well. 5. Team sports: While team sport athletes can win gold, they typically only win one per Olympics, making it less likely for them to be the top gold medal winner. 6. Recent Olympic trends: In Tokyo 2020, swimmers Caeleb Dressel (5 golds) and Emma McKeon (4 golds) were among the top individual gold medal winners, reinforcing swimming's strong position. 7. Time until the Olympics: With the Olympics about a year away, current top performers are likely to maintain their form, barring injuries or unexpected setbacks. Given these factors, swimmers have a strong chance of winning the most gold medals.

This diversity makes it less likely for a single nation to dominate across all of them. 3. Global competitiveness: Women's team sports have become increasingly competitive globally, with more nations investing in their programs and developing world-class teams. 4.

However, track and field athletes also have multiple opportunities for medals. The competition for most gold medals is typically between swimmers and track and field athletes. 2.

For condition (b), Joe Biden needs to remain President through the end of July 2024. This is highly likely as he is the incumbent president and has expressed his intention to run for re-election in 2024. The tricky part is that these two conditions seem somewhat contradictory.

This would need to be a temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment. 3. Biden would then need to resume his duties before the end of July 2024. While this scenario is possible (for example, if Biden undergoes a planned medical procedure requiring anesthesia), it's quite unlikely. Such temporary transfers of power are rare and usually very brief.

Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal: Sha'Carri Richardson is a talented American sprinter, known for her impressive performances in the 100m event. However, winning an Olympic gold medal is extremely challenging, especially in such a competitive field. Factors in her favor: - She has shown great potential and has been improving her times. - Home continent advantage (Olympics in Paris) might provide some benefit. Factors against: - Strong competition from other world-class sprinters. - The pressure of the Olympics can affect performance. - She has faced some setbacks in her career, including a suspension that prevented her from competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

(a) Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the nomination: As of now (July 2023), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. It's highly unusual for an incumbent president to withdraw from seeking re-nomination, especially this late in the process. Biden has consistently expressed his commitment to running again, and his campaign is actively preparing for the 2024 election. However, there are some factors that could potentially lead to a withdrawal: 1. Biden's age (he would be 82 at the start of a second term) and concerns about his health or cognitive abilities. 2. Extremely poor polling numbers or a significant political scandal. 3. Unforeseen personal or family issues. Given the current political landscape and Biden's stated intentions, the probability of him withdrawing before July 15, 2024, is quite low. (b) Kamala Harris being nominated as the Democratic VP: Kamala Harris is the current Vice President and has been working closely with Biden throughout his first term. In most cases, incumbent presidents keep their running mates when seeking re-election, as changing the ticket can be seen as a sign of instability or lack of confidence. Factors supporting Harris's renomination: 1. Continuity and stability of the current administration. 2. Her historic position as the first woman, first Black person, and first person of South Asian descent to be Vice President. 3. Her appeal to key Democratic constituencies. Factors that could lead to a different VP choice: 1. If Biden were to withdraw and Harris became the presidential nominee, a new VP would be chosen. 2. If the Biden campaign decides they need to shake up the ticket to improve their chances of winning.

(a) Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat: This scenario is quite specific and depends on the perception of Biden vs. a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. Historically, incumbent presidents often perform better than generic party candidates in polls. However, given Biden's current approval ratings and age concerns, it's possible that some voters might prefer a generic Democrat over him. Trump, being a known quantity, might benefit from this comparison. Still, a 3% difference is significant. I'd estimate this part has about a 30% chance of occurring. (b) USD being worth >= 145 JPY at close on August 9th, 2024: As of July 2023, the USD/JPY exchange rate is around 144. Predicting currency exchange rates more than a year in advance is highly challenging due to numerous factors including economic policies, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. The yen has been relatively weak against the dollar recently due to divergent monetary policies between the US and Japan. If this trend continues, reaching 145 or higher is plausible. However, a lot can change in a year. I'd estimate this part has about a 55% chance of occurring.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that there will be another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Convention. The incumbent advantage, lack of serious challengers, short time frame, and party unity all point towards a very low probability of a debate occurring.

(a) Another Democratic party presidential debate happening: As of now (July 2024), Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. Typically, when an incumbent president is running for re-election, their party doesn't hold primary debates. However, there are some factors to consider: 1. Biden's age and health concerns have led to some speculation about his candidacy. 2. There are potential challengers like Marianne Williamson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who have announced their candidacies. 3. The Democratic National Convention is still over a month away (August 19-22, 2024).

(a) Another Democratic party presidential debate before the 2024 Democratic National Convention: The likelihood of this occurring is very low. Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee. Historically, incumbent presidents rarely face primary challengers or participate in debates within their own party. The Democratic Party has shown strong support for Biden's re-election bid, and there are no significant challengers at this time. Additionally, the time frame is very short, with only about a month between the question's creation date and the resolution date, leaving little time to organize a debate. (b) Joe Biden drops out and a reliable media outlet covers it at least 6 hours in advance: The probability of this happening is also very low. Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election and has not shown any signs of considering dropping out. His campaign is actively fundraising and preparing for the general election. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, the Democratic Party leadership has rallied behind him. For Biden to drop out this close to the convention would be extremely unusual and potentially damaging to the party's chances in the general election. However, we must consider that unexpected events can occur in politics. While highly unlikely, there's always a small chance of a major health issue, personal crisis, or unforeseen scandal that could force Biden to withdraw. The requirement for media coverage 6 hours in advance adds another layer of complexity but is plausible if such an event were to occur. Combining these factors, the overall probability is very low, but not zero. The chance of a debate (part a) is nearly negligible, while the chance of Biden dropping out (part b), while still very unlikely, is slightly higher due to the unpredictable nature of personal and health-related issues.

Iran's recent actions: The April 13, 2024 drone and missile attack by Iran on Israel in response to an earlier strike on Iran's embassy in Syria has significantly heightened tensions between the two countries. 6. Israel's response: Following Iran's attack, Israel has vowed to respond, and there is significant pressure within Israel to retaliate against Iran directly. 7. Escalation risks: A direct attack on Iranian soil with multiple casualties would represent a significant escalation in the conflict, potentially leading to a wider regional war. 8. Strategic considerations: Israel may prefer to focus on more targeted, covert operations or cyber attacks rather than a high-casualty attack within Iran's borders. Given these factors, there is a non-trivial chance that Israel could carry out an attack within Iran before May 1, 2024. The recent Iranian attack on Israel has significantly increased the likelihood of Israeli retaliation. However, the short time frame and the potential for severe consequences may still deter Israel from conducting a large-scale, deadly attack within Iran's borders.

This coalition includes President Emmanuel Macron's party, Renaissance (formerly La R\u00e9publique En Marche!). 2. Time frame: The question asks about the situation on July 30, 2024, which is more than a year from now. A lot can change in French politics during this time. 3. French political system: In France, the President appoints the Prime Minister, who is usually from the party or coalition that holds the majority in the National Assembly. 4. Recent political trends: France has seen increasing political fragmentation, with traditional parties losing ground to newer movements on both the left and right. 5. Potential for political shifts: Given the volatile nature of French politics, there's a possibility of cabinet reshuffles or even early elections that could change the composition of the government. 6. Macron's term: President Macron's second term ends in 2027, so he will still be in office in July 2024. However, his ability to maintain a majority coalition might be challenged. 7. Opposition strength: The New Popular Front (NUPES) is currently the main opposition, but other parties or coalitions could gain strength by 2024. Considering these factors, it seems unlikely but not impossible for a Prime Minister from a coalition other than 'Together' or 'New Popular Front' to be in office by July 2024. The current 'Together' coalition has a plurality in the National Assembly, and while its position could weaken, it would require a significant political shift for a completely different coalition to take power.

The linked market getting at least 377 traders by the end of July 15: - This part has a much shorter timeframe (until July 15, 2024). - The number of traders (377) seems quite specific and high for a prediction market. - Without knowing the current number of traders or the typical growth rate of traders on this platform, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of reaching this number. - The mention of 'market shenanigans' suggests there might be some unusual activity or interest in this market, which could potentially drive up participation.

Kamala Harris choosing Mark Kelly or Josh Shapiro as her VP pick: - The resolution date is set for August 6, 2024, which aligns with the reported timeline of Harris choosing before August 7th. - However, it's important to note that Kamala Harris is not currently the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has not indicated he won't run for re-election. - The scenario where Harris would be choosing a VP seems unlikely unless there's a major shift in the Democratic party's plans that we're unaware of. - Even if Harris were to become the nominee, it's too early to predict with certainty who she would choose as a running mate. 2.

Given these considerations, the second part of the question (about reaching 377 traders) seems more likely to occur than the first part (Harris choosing a VP).

Manifold users are likely to be more politically engaged and potentially more informed than the average voter, which could lead to different results. 2. Perception of Joe Biden vs. a generic Democrat: Biden, as the incumbent president, carries both the advantages and disadvantages of his record.

Federal Reserve policy: The Fed has been actively working to bring inflation down to its 2% target. By July 2024, their policies may have had more time to take effect, potentially slowing inflation. 3. Economic conditions: The state of the economy in mid-2024 will play a crucial role. Factors like employment rates, wage growth, and consumer spending will influence inflation. 4. Global factors: International events, supply chain issues, or commodity prices could impact inflation. 5. Seasonal adjustments: July typically doesn't have strong seasonal effects on Core CPI, so this shouldn't be a major factor. 6. Time frame: The question is about July 2024, which is about a year from now. This long time frame increases uncertainty. 7. Core CPI exclusions: Core CPI excludes food and energy prices, which are often more volatile. This makes Core CPI generally more stable, but still subject to changes.

The historical trend supports this, and while the Fed is working to reduce inflation, completely taming it to consistently low levels may take time. However, the long time frame and potential success of Fed policies introduce significant uncertainty."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "051687a2-a49b-416e-a865-b5270efb74c8", "title": "Will Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August?", "body": "Resolves YES if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) invokes Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time).\n\nThe duration of the incapacity does not matter for this question.\n\nBiden exiting the office of the Presidency by death, resignation, etc does not count.

(a) US Core CPI increase in July 2024: The Core CPI (Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy) is a key measure of inflation. Historically, month-over-month increases of more than 0.1% are common. However, predicting specific economic indicators over a year in advance is challenging due to numerous variables that can affect inflation. Recent trends show that the Federal Reserve has been actively working to control inflation, and their efforts might lead to more moderate increases in Core CPI by mid-2024. However, economic conditions can change rapidly, and external factors like global events or policy shifts could impact inflation rates. Given the historical data and the uncertainty of long-term economic predictions, I would estimate the probability of Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024 to be around 0.7 or 70%.

The 25th Amendment has never been invoked in this manner in U.S. history. 2.

Biden's health, while a topic of discussion due to his age, has not shown signs of severe decline that would warrant such an extreme measure. 4. The political ramifications of such an action would be enormous, making it an incredibly high bar for implementation.

However, the Federal Reserve has been actively working to curb inflation, and their efforts might show results by July 2024.

While President Biden is the oldest serving president and concerns about his age and health have been raised, there's no concrete evidence suggesting he's unable to discharge his duties. For this to happen, it would require a significant and sudden decline in Biden's health or mental capacity, as well as agreement from the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet.

Historical data shows that the SENSEX has had annual returns exceeding 15% in some years, but it's not common. Additionally, predicting a specific narrow range (75,000 to 76,000) adds another layer of difficulty. The probability of hitting this exact range is quite low. (b) Manifold market traders: The second part of the question refers to a specific prediction market on Manifold Markets. Without access to the current state of this market or historical data on its growth rate, it's challenging to make a precise estimate. However, reaching 377 traders in a niche prediction market by July 15 seems like a more achievable goal than the specific SENSEX range. Considering both parts together: While each individual condition has a relatively low probability of occurring, the fact that only one needs to be true increases the overall likelihood of a YES resolution. The market trader condition seems more likely to be met than the SENSEX condition, but both are uncertain. Given the information available and the nature of the question, I would estimate a moderate probability for this question resolving YES."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.13629664378903497, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03407416094725874, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5337189844837804, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Age and health: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. While his age has been a topic of discussion, he has maintained that he is fit for office and has regular health check-ups. 3.

Time frame: The question asks about the period up to July 20, 2024, which is before the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). This gives a significant amount of time for potential changes or unforeseen circumstances. 5. Historical precedent: It is extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election race, especially this far in advance. 6.

Considering these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden will drop out before July 20, 2024.

Biden is the incumbent, which typically favors running for re-election. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden is currently 81 years old and would be 86 at the end of a second term. There have been ongoing discussions about his age and fitness for office, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current political climate: As of now, Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee and has been campaigning for re-election. He has not shown any signs of stepping down or declining the nomination. 4. Time frame: The question's resolution date is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention, which is typically held in August. It's unlikely for a sitting president to withdraw so close to the convention without extenuating circumstances. 5. Lack of strong alternative candidates: The Democratic Party hasn't been grooming any clear alternatives to Biden, which suggests they are committed to his candidacy. 6. Biden's public statements: He has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has not indicated any plans to step down. 7.

While age and health concerns are real factors, they don't appear to be severe enough at this time to force such a drastic decision. The political costs of withdrawing so close to the election would be significant, and there's no clear indication that Biden or his team are considering this option.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden between 2 and 3 points on July 15, 2024: As of the question's creation date (July 9, 2024), Trump has a 2.4-point lead over Biden. This is already within the specified range. However, we need to consider potential changes in the next week: 1. Polls can fluctuate quickly, especially in a close race. 2. The specified range (2-3 points) is relatively narrow, making it somewhat less likely to hit exactly. 3. Major events or scandals could shift polls significantly in either direction. 4. Historically, incumbent presidents (in this case, Biden) often see some improvement in polls as the election nears. Given these factors, I'd estimate about a 30% chance of Trump's lead being in this specific range on July 15. (b) CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024: This is more challenging to predict without knowing the current value. However, we can consider some factors: 1. Volatility tends to increase during election years due to uncertainty. 2. Economic conditions, geopolitical events, and market sentiment can all impact volatility. 3. The comparison is year-over-year, so we're looking at relative change rather than absolute levels. 4. The timeframe (one year) is long enough for significant changes to occur. Given these factors, I'd estimate about a 55% chance of the volatility index being higher year-over-year. To resolve YES, either (a) or (b) needs to occur.

This means Nvidia would need to grow substantially while Apple remains stagnant or declines for this to occur. 2. Growth potential: Nvidia has been experiencing rapid growth due to the AI boom and its dominance in GPU technology.

Apple, while a mature company, continues to innovate and has a loyal customer base. Its services segment is growing, which could provide additional value. 3. Market trends: The AI and machine learning markets are expected to continue growing, which could benefit Nvidia. However, there's also a risk of market saturation or competition catching up.

State-by-state variations: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently. Some states might be more inclined to take action against Trump than others. 3. Ongoing legal challenges: There are already efforts underway in some states to challenge Trump's eligibility under the 14th Amendment.

Several states have considered or are considering removing Trump from the ballot based on his actions related to the January 6th Capitol riot. Colorado and Maine have already taken steps to remove him, though these decisions are being challenged in court. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on this issue, with a decision expected in early 2024. Their ruling will likely set a precedent for all states.

Name recognition: Suarez is not widely known on the national stage compared to other potential Republican candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley. Fundraising ability: As a relatively unknown candidate, Suarez may struggle to raise the substantial funds needed for a competitive national campaign. Political experience: Suarez lacks experience at the federal level, which is often seen as crucial for presidential candidates. Current polling: As of now, Suarez is not registering significant support in national polls for the Republican nomination. Competition: The Republican field is likely to be crowded with more established and well-known candidates, making it difficult for a lesser-known candidate to break through. Time until convention: While there is still time until the Republican National Convention in 2024, it would be challenging for Suarez to build the necessary momentum and support in this timeframe. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for a mayor to directly become a major party's presidential nominee without holding higher office first.

If Trump is the Republican nominee, which seems likely at this point, the race could be close. Trump has a strong base of support, but also high unfavorability ratings. Biden narrowly defeated Trump in 2020, and a rematch could be competitive.

Elon Musk's $57 billion package: This is an extraordinarily large compensation package, which is likely to draw scrutiny from proxy advisors like ISS. The size alone increases the likelihood of ISS recommending against it. 3. Corporate governance concerns: ISS typically focuses on good corporate governance practices. Tesla has faced criticism for its board composition, including the presence of Kimbal Musk (Elon's brother) as a board member, which could be seen as compromising independence. 4. Recent legal challenges: A Delaware judge recently ruled that Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package was unfair to shareholders and should be voided.

The recent court ruling on Musk's pay package and ISS's past recommendations make it particularly probable that they will advise against the compensation package.

However, given that the market has about 1.5 months to reach this goal (from the creation date to the resolution date), it seems plausible that it could attract 377 traders, especially if it's a topic of high interest. The specificity of the number (377) suggests it might be based on some existing benchmark or trend. (b) Regarding ISS advising against Elon Musk's $57 billion package or Kimbal Musk's re-election: Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is known for its influential recommendations on corporate governance matters. Given the controversial nature of Elon Musk's compensation package and the criticism around Kimbal Musk's position on the board (often cited as an example of poor corporate governance due to family ties), there's a significant chance that ISS might advise against one or both of these. Historical context is important here: 1. In 2018, ISS recommended against Elon Musk's previous compensation plan, citing its unprecedented size. 2. In 2022, ISS recommended against the re-election of Kimbal Musk to the board, citing a lack of relevant industry experience and questioning his independence.

Marketing and hype: Marvel/Disney are known for their extensive marketing campaigns, which could drive higher opening weekend attendance. 6. Post-pandemic box office trends: While the movie industry has been recovering, some blockbusters have been performing exceptionally well, suggesting audiences are eager for big-screen experiences. 7. Inflation: Box office numbers have generally been trending upward due to inflation, giving newer movies an advantage in raw dollar amounts. 8. Release date: The movie is set to release on July 26, 2024, which is typically a good time for summer blockbusters. 9. Competition: Without knowing the full summer 2024 release schedule, it's hard to gauge competition, but Marvel movies often dominate their opening weekends. Given these factors, especially the combined star power, the MCU integration, and the general upward trend in box office numbers, it seems highly likely that \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" will surpass the $185.5 million mark. The combination of these two popular characters in one film, backed by Disney's marketing machine and the MCU brand, presents a strong case for an exceptionally high opening weekend. However, there's always some uncertainty in box office predictions, and unexpected factors (like poor reviews or unforeseen competition) could impact performance."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "e8fa4d09-ef7c-42d4-9852-da1520ac169a", "title": "Will both (1) Taylor Swift cameo in Deadpool and Wolverine and (2) the domestic box office opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" be higher than that of \"Deadpool\" and \"The Wolverine\" combined?", "body": "(1) Resolves YES if Taylor Swift appears in the movie \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" in any role, even if it is just her voice used for a character.

Taylor Swift cameo in Deadpool and Wolverine: Taylor Swift is known to be good friends with Ryan Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively. She has also shown interest in acting, having appeared in films like 'Valentine's Day' and 'Cats.' Given the playful nature of the Deadpool franchise and its tendency to include unexpected cameos, it's not implausible that Swift could make an appearance. However, there's no concrete evidence or rumors suggesting her involvement in the film. The probability of this happening is relatively low, but not impossible. Let's estimate this at about 20%. 2. Box office opening higher than Deadpool and The Wolverine combined: The target to beat is $185,548,391. Several factors support a high opening: - Deadpool and Wolverine are both very popular characters with established fanbases. - This film brings them together for the first time, which is likely to generate significant buzz. - The Marvel Cinematic Universe connection could attract a broader audience. - The previous Deadpool film already surpassed this number on its own. However, we should also consider potential challenges: - The box office has been somewhat unpredictable post-pandemic. - Superhero fatigue could potentially impact numbers. Given these factors, the probability of surpassing the combined box office seems quite high, perhaps around 80%. For the overall question to resolve as YES, both of these events need to occur. We calculate this by multiplying the probabilities: 0.20 * 0.80 = 0.16 or 16%.

(a) Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4: This is an extremely rare event that has never been invoked in U.S. history. For this to occur, there would need to be a severe decline in Biden's cognitive or physical health, to the point where he is unable to discharge his duties, and the Vice President and Cabinet would need to agree on this assessment. While there have been concerns about Biden's age and occasional gaffes, there is no concrete evidence of severe incapacitation. The administration and Democratic Party would likely resist such a move unless absolutely necessary, as it would be politically damaging. The probability of this occurring in the next year is very low. (b) Joe Biden dies before August 2024: Biden is currently 80 years old (born November 20, 1942). While his age does increase the risk of mortality, he has access to excellent healthcare and appears to be in relatively good health for his age. According to actuarial tables, the annual mortality rate for an 80-year-old male in the U.S. is approximately 5.6%. However, this is for the average population, and Biden likely has better odds due to his access to top-tier medical care. Combining these factors: The probability of scenario (a) is extremely low, likely less than 1%. The probability of scenario (b) is higher but still relatively low, perhaps around 4-5% for the given timeframe. Since we only need one of these events to occur for the question to resolve YES, we need to combine these probabilities. However, they are not simply additive as there is a small chance of overlap (i.e., Biden could be declared incapacitated and then die).

While there's been progress, there are also significant challenges: - Many countries have expressed concerns about sovereignty and the treaty's potential impact on national decision-making. - The negotiation process has been complex and time-consuming. - The target date for adoption has already been pushed back once from May 2023 to May 2024. Given these factors, while it's possible the agreement could be approved in May 2024, it seems more likely that further negotiations or delays might occur. I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 40%. 2. OpenAI publicly committing to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle: Several factors to consider: - The AI safety community has been increasingly vocal about the need for such principles. - OpenAI has shown some willingness to engage with safety concerns in the past. - The timeframe (before July 1, 2024) gives OpenAI ample time to make such a commitment. - However, companies are often reluctant to make binding commitments that could potentially limit their actions. - The requirement for verification by Metaculus and satisfaction of righttowarn.ai members adds an additional hurdle. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 30%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we get: 0.40 + 0.30 - (0.40 * 0.30) = 0.58.

Competition: While other nations have improved in basketball, the U.S. still remains the favorite in both categories. However, teams like Spain, Australia, and Serbia for men, and Australia, Spain, and Japan for women have shown they can compete at a high level. 5. Preparation: The U.S. teams typically have less time to prepare together compared to other national teams, which can sometimes lead to early tournament struggles. 6.

(a) Team USA winning both Men's and Women's 5v5 basketball gold medals at the Paris Olympics: Team USA has a strong history in Olympic basketball. The women's team has been particularly dominant, winning the last seven consecutive Olympic gold medals (1996-2021). The men's team has won four consecutive gold medals (2008-2021), with their last non-gold finish being bronze in 2004.

The men's team, while still favored, faces stiffer competition from other nations that have been improving in recent years. Their chances might be around 70-75%. The probability of both teams winning gold would be the product of their individual probabilities. Let's estimate this at approximately 0.90 * 0.75 = 0.675 or 67.5%.

For example: - 2016 Rio Olympics: 27 world records - 2012 London Olympics: 32 world records - 2008 Beijing Olympics: 43 world records The trend shows a decrease in the number of world records broken per Olympics. However, advancements in training, technology, and the excitement of the Paris Olympics could lead to more record-breaking performances. The threshold of 24 is achievable but not guaranteed. 2.

However, host nations often perform better due to increased funding, home advantage, and motivation. For example: - UK in 2012: 3rd place - Brazil in 2016: 13th place (up from 22nd in 2012) - Japan in 2020: 3rd place France has a strong sporting culture and will likely invest heavily in preparation for the home Olympics. This significantly increases their chances of reaching the top 5. Combining the probabilities: For both conditions to be met, we need both events to occur. The probability of breaking 24 world records seems moderately high, perhaps around 60%. The probability of France reaching the top 5 also seems increased due to the home advantage, perhaps around 70%. However, these events are not entirely independent.

The number can vary significantly between Olympics, often depending on factors like new technologies in equipment or advancements in training methods. While 24 is a high number, it's not unprecedented. However, as records become harder to break over time, achieving 24 broken records might be challenging. 2. France placing in the Top 5: France has not finished in the top 5 of the medal table in recent Summer Olympics. In Tokyo 2020, they finished 8th. In Rio 2016, they were 7th. However, being the host country often provides a significant advantage. Host nations typically invest more in athlete preparation and benefit from home crowd support. For example, Great Britain jumped from 4th in Beijing 2008 to 3rd in London 2012, and Japan improved from 6th in Rio 2016 to 3rd in Tokyo 2020.

Historical context indicates that the US has been experiencing elevated inflation rates over the past couple of years, though it has shown signs of moderating in recent months. The Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is a more stable measure of underlying inflation trends. In the past year, month-over-month Core CPI increases have often exceeded 0.1%, but there have been months with lower increases as well. The Federal Reserve has been implementing aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation, and these actions typically take time to fully impact the economy and inflation rates. Economic conditions, such as labor market tightness, supply chain issues, and consumer demand, can also influence inflation rates. While the question specifies seasonally adjusted data, there might still be some residual seasonal effects in July. Given that the question is about July 2024, which is about a year from now, this adds significant uncertainty to the forecast. However, historical data suggests that month-over-month increases exceeding 0.1% are quite common, even in periods of more moderate inflation.

(b) Month-over-Month US Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July: Core CPI (excluding food and energy) tends to be more stable than overall CPI.

While tech stocks can be volatile, such a drastic drop without a major catastrophic event is improbable. 2. US Core CPI increase by more than 0.1% in July: The Core CPI (Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy) is a key measure of inflation. In recent months, inflation has been moderating in the US, but it's still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The question is about July 2024, which is a year from now. It's difficult to predict inflation that far in advance, but we can make some educated guesses: - The Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation. - By July 2024, these measures will have had more time to take effect. - However, core inflation tends to be sticky and slow to change. - In recent months, core CPI has been increasing by around 0.2-0.4% month-over-month.

However, we can consider current trends and historical data: 1. Trump and Biden are likely to be the nominees for their respective parties. 2. Recent polls have shown a close race, with leads often within a few percentage points. 3. The specific range (2-3 points) is quite narrow, making it less likely to occur on that exact date. 4.

Neither side has made rapid, large-scale territorial gains in recent months. 5. Russian objectives: Russia has shown a continued interest in fully controlling the Donetsk Oblast, which includes Chasiv Yar. 6. Ukrainian defenses: Ukraine has been fortifying its positions and has shown resilience in defending key areas. 7.

Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in multiple states to remove Trump from the ballot using this argument. The most prominent cases are in Colorado and Minnesota. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which gives ample time for legal challenges to be filed, heard, and potentially appealed through various court levels. 4.

While the legal argument for disqualification under the 14th Amendment has some merit, successfully removing Trump from even one state's ballot faces significant hurdles. The courts have generally been reluctant to interfere with ballot access, especially for major party candidates. However, the unprecedented nature of the January 6th events and Trump's actions surrounding them do provide a unique context that could lead to a different outcome.

The probability of death occurring in such a brief period is generally low for someone not suffering from a terminal illness. 5.

As of now, Donald Trump is the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination, with other candidates like Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley also polling higher than Ted Cruz. Cruz has not even announced his candidacy for the 2024 election. Given Trump's strong base of support within the Republican Party and Cruz's relative lack of momentum, it's highly unlikely that Cruz would emerge as the nominee. 2. Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024: This condition is more plausible but still quite specific. Current polls show a close race between Trump and Biden, with leads often within a few percentage points. However, predicting a lead within such a narrow range (3-4 points) over a year in advance is extremely difficult. Many factors could influence polling numbers between now and July 2024, including economic conditions, international events, and campaign developments. For both conditions to be true, we would need an extremely unlikely scenario where Cruz somehow becomes the nominee (perhaps due to unforeseen circumstances preventing other candidates from running) AND Trump (who would not be the nominee in this scenario) maintains a very specific lead over Biden in the polls.

(a) Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the Democratic nomination: As of now (July 2024), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election. It's extremely rare for a sitting president to decline their party's nomination for a second term, especially this late in the election cycle. Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election and has been actively campaigning. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have remained committed to his re-election bid. The deadline (July 15, 2024) is very close, leaving little time for such a major shift in plans. The probability of this occurring is very low, perhaps around 5%. (b) Another Democratic party presidential debate before the convention: Given that Biden is the presumptive nominee and there are no significant challengers, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has not scheduled any debates. Debates typically occur when there's a competitive primary, which is not the case here. Even if Biden were to unexpectedly withdraw, the time between July 15 and the convention would be very short to organize a debate among potential replacements. The probability of this occurring is also very low, perhaps around 10%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.05 * 0.10 = 0.005 or 0.5%.

(a) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination: - Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. - Historically, incumbent presidents rarely drop out of their re-election campaigns, especially this close to the election. - Biden's age and health have been topics of concern, but there have been no recent indications of severe health issues that would force him to withdraw. - The deadline for this announcement (July 15, 2024) is very close to the Democratic National Convention, making it unlikely for such a major change to occur at that late stage. - The probability of this occurring is quite low, estimated at around 5-10%. (b) Another Democratic party presidential debate: - With Biden as the presumptive nominee, the Democratic Party has little incentive to hold additional debates that could potentially divide the party. - The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has not announced any plans for additional debates. - However, if Biden were to withdraw or face a significant challenge, the likelihood of debates would increase dramatically. - There's also a small possibility that the party might organize a debate to showcase Biden's strengths against potential Republican opponents. - The probability of this occurring is also relatively low, estimated at around 15-20%. Combining these probabilities, we need to consider that either event could occur independently. Using the formula for the probability of at least one of two independent events occurring (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), and using the higher end of our estimates: P(A or B) = 0.10 + 0.20 - (0.10 * 0.20) = 0.28 or 28%.

Increasing pressure for AI transparency: There's growing public and regulatory pressure for major AI companies to be more transparent about their AI models' capabilities and potential risks. 3. Industry trends: Other major AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have published reports on external red-teaming of their models. This creates a precedent and potential competitive pressure for DeepMind to do the same. 4. Time frame: The question gives a deadline of June 30, 2024, which is about a year from now. This provides ample time for DeepMind to conduct external red-teaming and prepare a report. 5. DeepMind's past behavior: While DeepMind has been open about many aspects of their research, they haven't always been the first to publish detailed safety reports or engage in public external red-teaming. 6. Potential drawbacks: Publishing such a report could expose vulnerabilities in their models, which might make DeepMind hesitant. 7. Regulatory environment: Depending on how AI regulation develops over the next year, there might be increased pressure or even requirements for such transparency. Considering these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that DeepMind will publish such a report by the given deadline. The growing emphasis on AI safety, industry trends, and potential regulatory pressures all point towards this outcome.

Historical ratings: Looking at the provided ratings for both seasons, we can see that out of the 15 episodes with known ratings, 7 episodes (46.7%) have scored above 8.5. This suggests that achieving a score above 8.5 is not uncommon for the series, but it's also not guaranteed. 2. Season 2 performance: In the current season, only 1 out of 5 rated episodes (20%) has scored above 8.5. This indicates a potential downward trend in ratings for Season 2 compared to Season 1. 3. Episode importance: Episode 7 in a season is typically significant, often featuring major plot developments or climactic events. In Season 1, Episode 7 received a high rating of 9.1, which could be a positive indicator for Season 2's Episode 7. 4. Recent episode performance: The ratings for Season 2 have been inconsistent, with the most recent episode (E5) receiving the lowest rating of the series at 7.6. This could indicate viewer dissatisfaction or a lull in the storyline. 5. Potential for improvement: Given the low rating of the previous episode, there might be extra effort from the creators to deliver a high-quality episode to regain viewer interest and boost ratings. 6. Fan expectations: As the season progresses, fan expectations typically increase, which can lead to either higher ratings if the episode meets or exceeds expectations, or lower ratings if it disappoints. Considering these factors, there's a reasonable chance that S2E7 could achieve a rating above 8.5, especially if it delivers significant plot developments or exceptional quality. However, the inconsistent performance of Season 2 and the recent low rating create uncertainty. Given the mixed indicators, I would estimate the probability to be slightly below 50%, as the recent trend doesn't strongly support a high rating, but the potential for a pivotal episode and historical performance of Episode 7 provide some positive indicators."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "3683aef6-eb39-43b0-a402-800c1a704f77", "title": "Will the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15?

Time frame: We have approximately one year from now until the end of July 2024, which is a significant amount of time for such an interview to occur. 3. Election cycle: As we approach the 2024 presidential election, Biden (assuming he runs for re-election) will likely increase his media presence to reach voters. Long-form interviews can be an effective way to communicate his message and connect with the electorate. 4. Campaign strategy: Biden's team may see value in longer interviews to allow him to explain his policies in depth and address concerns about his age and mental acuity. 5. Media interest: There will likely be high demand from media outlets for in-depth interviews with the sitting president as the election approaches. 6. Biden's preferences: While Biden has done some longer interviews, he seems to prefer shorter formats or more controlled environments like press conferences. This could potentially limit the number of long-form interviews he agrees to. 7. Health and stamina concerns: Given Biden's age, there might be concerns about his ability to sustain a 45+ minute interview, which could make his team more cautious about scheduling such events. 8. Competing priorities: As a sitting president, Biden's schedule is often packed with official duties, which might limit opportunities for lengthy interviews. Considering these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Biden will participate in at least one 45+ minute in-person interview before the end of July 2024. The approaching election, the need to connect with voters, and the precedent of having done such interviews before all point towards this occurring.

Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average: This is a very specific range for Trump's lead. As of the question's creation date (July 8, 2024), Trump was leading by 2.4 points. While this falls within the specified range, polling averages can fluctuate significantly over a week. The narrow range (between 2 and 3 points) makes this condition less likely to be met. However, given the current trend, it's not implausible. Estimated probability for this condition: 0.3 2. Joe Biden having an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024: Biden has been known to give fewer long-form interviews compared to his predecessors. The question mentions that his most recent qualifying interview was in April on The Howard Stern Show. Given that it's an election year, Biden might be more inclined to do long-form interviews to reach voters. However, his team might also prefer more controlled, shorter appearances to minimize gaffes. The timeframe (by the end of July) gives about three weeks for this to occur, which is a relatively short period. Additionally, the strict criteria (45+ minutes of new footage, in-person) make this less likely. Estimated probability for this condition: 0.4 For both events to occur simultaneously, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12 This calculation assumes the events are independent, which they largely are, although there could be some correlation (e.g., if Trump's lead grows, Biden might be more likely to do a long interview to address it)."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "38d36649-bcd3-4ab0-9eae-c005e9ccd5ca", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?

(a) Trump's lead over Biden in 538's national polling average: As of now (July 2023), it's difficult to predict with high accuracy what the polling average will be exactly on July 15, 2024. Polls can be volatile, especially in the months leading up to an election. The specific range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) is quite narrow, making it less likely to hit this exact range. However, recent polls have shown Trump with a slight lead over Biden, so it's not implausible for Trump to be leading by this margin. Given the narrow range and the uncertainty of polls this far out, I'd estimate the probability of this specific condition being met at around 15-20%. (b) Joe Biden having a 45+ minute in-person interview on camera: Biden has been known to limit his media appearances, especially long-form interviews. However, as the election approaches, there will likely be increased pressure for him to engage more with the media. The timeframe (before the end of July 2024) gives ample opportunity for such an interview to occur. The criteria exclude many types of appearances (press conferences, speeches, rallies, etc.), which narrows the possibilities. Given the importance of media engagement during a presidential campaign, it seems more likely than not that Biden would participate in at least one long-form interview before July 2024. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60-70%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves YES if either (a) or (b) occurs.

The frontrunners for the Republican nomination are Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, with other candidates like Nikki Haley and Mike Pence also in the mix.

Condition B: FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024. This condition is more likely to be met.

Scott's polling numbers and name recognition are significantly lower than theirs. While it's not impossible for Scott to win the nomination, it seems highly unlikely given the current political landscape. 2. FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This scenario is more likely. Joe Biden is the incumbent president, which historically gives him an advantage. However, his approval ratings have been relatively low, and there are concerns about his age and performance. The political landscape can change significantly between now and July 2024, but as of now, many polls show a close race between Biden and potential Republican nominees. FiveThirtyEight is known for its data-driven approach and has been relatively accurate in past elections. If Biden maintains his incumbent advantage and the economy improves, there's a good chance FiveThirtyEight could project him as the favorite. However, this is far from certain given the current political climate and Biden's challenges. Considering both scenarios, the probability of either occurring is higher than each individual scenario.

Recent trends: While environmental issues have gained prominence in recent years, potentially benefiting the Greens, there hasn't been a massive surge in support for far-left parties (represented by GUE/NGL) across Europe. 4. Political landscape: The European political landscape remains dominated by center-right and center-left parties, with right-wing populist parties also gaining ground in many countries. This makes it unlikely for either the Greens or the far-left to become the largest group. 5. Electoral system: The proportional representation system used in European elections tends to favor larger, more established parties and coalitions. 6. Fragmentation: Even if support for green or left-wing policies increases, it may be spread across multiple parties or groups, not necessarily consolidating under Greens\u2013EFA or GUE/NGL. 7. Time until election: The election is still about a year away, which leaves room for political shifts. However, a complete overhaul of the political landscape to the extent that either of these groups becomes the largest seems highly improbable. Given these factors, it appears highly unlikely that either the Greens\u2013EFA or GUE/NGL will hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections. While there's always a possibility of unexpected political shifts, the current political landscape and historical trends suggest that this outcome has a very low probability."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The current frontrunner for the Republican nomination is Donald Trump, followed by other experienced politicians like Ron DeSantis.

However, predicting a lead in this exact range (3-4 points) on a specific date more than a year from now is highly uncertain. The probability of this exact scenario occurring might be around 5-10%. For both conditions to be true, we need to multiply these probabilities, which results in an extremely low likelihood. Even if we're generous with our estimates, the probability of both events occurring simultaneously is minuscule. Moreover, these events are not entirely independent.

Tucker Carlson being the Republican nominee: Tucker Carlson is a popular conservative commentator, but he has not officially entered the race for the Republican nomination.

Carlson has repeatedly stated that he has no interest in running for president. Given these factors, the probability of Carlson becoming the Republican nominee is extremely low. 2. Trump's lead over Biden being between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024: This is a very specific range, which makes it less likely to occur. Current polling shows a close race between Trump and Biden, with neither having a consistent large lead. However, polls this far out from the election are not very predictive. Many factors can influence polling numbers, including economic conditions, international events, and campaign strategies. While it's possible for Trump to have a lead in this specific range, the narrow window makes it unlikely. Combining these two conditions: Since this is an 'or' condition, we need to consider the probability of either event occurring. The first condition (Carlson as nominee) is highly unlikely. The second condition (Trump's specific lead) is also unlikely due to the narrow range specified, but not as improbable as the first condition.

Historical patterns: Polling averages tend to fluctuate as the election approaches, with more volatility closer to the election date. 3. Time frame: July 15, 2024, is very close to the election (November 2024), so polls at this time are likely to be more accurate and reflective of voter sentiment. 4.

FiveThirtyEight's methodology: Their polling average is known for being robust and accounting for various factors, including poll quality and recency. 6. Potential events: Any major events (debates, scandals, economic shifts) occurring before July 2024 could significantly impact the polling. 7. Incumbent factor: Biden is the incumbent, which historically has provided an advantage, but his approval ratings have been low. 8. Third-party candidates: The presence of strong third-party candidates could affect the margin between the two main candidates. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Trump's lead will fall within this specific range. The current trends suggest Trump is leading, but the exact margin is difficult to predict this far in advance. The narrow range (2-3 points) makes it less likely than a broader range would be.

Given these factors, it's challenging to predict with high certainty that Trump's lead will fall within such a narrow range (between 2 and 3 points) on a specific date. The polling average could easily be outside this range due to the volatility of political races and the long time frame until the specified date. However, considering that current polls show a close race, and assuming no major disruptive events, it's plausible that the race could remain relatively tight.

President Macron's term: Emmanuel Macron's second term as President runs until 2027, and he has the power to appoint and dismiss Prime Ministers. 5. Political landscape: The Together coalition, while currently in power, has faced challenges and does not have an absolute majority in the National Assembly. 6. Time frame: The question asks about the situation on July 30, 2024, which is over a year away from the current date. Given these factors, I believe there's a good chance that the Prime Minister on July 30, 2024, will still belong to the Together coalition, but it's far from certain. Here's why: - Macron is likely to maintain his alliance with the Together coalition to keep his support base. - Without major elections scheduled, there's no clear trigger for a change in government. - However, political pressures or a desire to refresh the government could lead Macron to choose a Prime Minister from outside the coalition. - The lack of an absolute majority for Together in the National Assembly could potentially force compromises in leadership. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a higher than even chance that the Prime Minister will still be from the Together coalition, but with significant uncertainty due to the long time frame and potential for political shifts."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "35e3fd92-0810-4a04-a9af-5a0f340c954f", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The Republicans Party of France (Les R\u00e9publicains) forms a political alliance with the National Rally for the 2024 French legislative election and (b) The Prime Minister of France belongs to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024?", "body": "(a) This question resolves as **Yes** if before June 30, 2024, an electoral alliance or coalition agreement is officially announced between the Republicans Party (Les R\u00e9publicains) and National Rally (Rassemblement National) for the upcoming [French legislative election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_legislative_election), according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).

The Republicans (LR) are a center-right party, while the National Rally (RN) is a far-right party. Their ideologies have significant differences.\n2.

(a) An electoral alliance between Les R\u00e9publicains and National Rally by mid-2024: This scenario seems highly unlikely. Les R\u00e9publicains (LR) is a center-right party, while National Rally (RN) is a far-right party. Historically, there has been a strong 'cordon sanitaire' in French politics against allying with far-right parties. LR has consistently rejected alliances with RN to maintain its mainstream position. While some LR members have shown openness to RN in recent years, an official alliance would be a dramatic shift in French politics. Given the short timeframe (by mid-2024) and the significant ideological differences, this scenario is very improbable. (b) The Prime Minister belongs to the Together coalition by July 30, 2024: This scenario is more likely. The Together coalition (Ensemble) is President Emmanuel Macron's alliance. As of now (2023), the Prime Minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, is from this coalition. However, Macron's party lost its absolute majority in the National Assembly in the 2022 legislative elections, making governance more challenging. There are several factors to consider: 1. Macron cannot run for re-election in 2027, which might affect political dynamics. 2. The opposition parties have been gaining strength, particularly on the far-right and far-left. 3. Macron might reshuffle his government to address political challenges. Despite these factors, the most likely scenario is that Macron will try to maintain control through his coalition until the end of his term. The French system gives significant power to the President, and Macron has shown resilience in navigating political challenges.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024: As of now (2023), it's difficult to predict polling numbers for a specific date more than a year in advance. However, we can consider current trends and historical data: Recent polls have shown Trump and Biden in a close race, with leads often within the margin of error. The political landscape can change significantly in a year, especially considering ongoing legal issues for Trump and concerns about Biden's age. A lead between 3 and 4 points is relatively narrow and plausible, but it's a specific range that limits the probability. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this specific scenario at around 15%. (b) Larry Elder being the Republican nominee: Larry Elder is not currently considered a frontrunner for the Republican nomination. As of now, Trump is the clear favorite, followed by other prominent figures like Ron DeSantis. Elder's national profile, while increased after his California recall campaign, is still relatively low compared to other potential candidates. The Republican party typically favors candidates with broader national appeal or extensive political experience. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Larry Elder becoming the Republican nominee at about 1%. Combining the probabilities: The question asks if either of these events will occur. To calculate this, we need to use the formula for the probability of either event occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since these events are independent (one doesn't affect the other), P(A and B) is simply P(A) * P(B). P(Either event) = 0.15 + 0.01 - (0.15 * 0.01) = 0.15985.

Given these factors, especially the existing opposition, the low threshold for signatures, and the reasonable time frame, it seems quite likely that at least 20 Democratic lawmakers will sign such a letter.

Current political landscape: As of now, there are no major challengers to Biden within the Democratic Party. While there have been some concerns about his age and approval ratings, the party leadership has largely rallied behind him. 3. Party unity: The Democratic Party has shown a strong desire for unity to present a united front against the Republican opposition. This makes it less likely for serious internal challenges to emerge. 4.

At this late stage, it would be highly unusual for there to be enough uncertainty to lead to a brokered convention. 5. Historical precedent: Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern American politics. The last time Democrats had a truly brokered convention was in 1952. 6.

Given these factors, it is highly improbable that the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024.

(a) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early: Given the information provided, there seems to be significant discontent among House Democrats regarding the DNC's plan to seal Biden's nomination early. Rep. Jared Huffman is actively circulating a draft letter, and the article mentions 'dozens' of House Democrats organizing against this plan. This suggests a substantial level of opposition within the party. However, there are a few factors to consider: 1. The deadline is relatively short (July 21st). 2. Publicly opposing the party leadership is a risky move for many politicians. 3. The requirement is specifically for 20 House Members or Senators, which is a significant number. Given the active organization and the mention of 'dozens' of Democrats involved, it seems reasonably likely that they could gather 20 signatures. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 60%. (b) Democrats having a brokered convention in 2024: This is a much less likely scenario. Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern American politics. The last brokered convention for Democrats was in 1952. Several factors make this unlikely: 1. Incumbent presidents almost never face serious primary challenges. 2. The Democratic Party has shown strong support for Biden's re-election. 3. The party typically works to avoid the appearance of disunity that a brokered convention would create. While there is some discontent within the party, it's unlikely to be enough to force a brokered convention. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 5%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.05 = 0.03 or 3%.

Let's break it down: (a) Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024: This is an extremely unlikely event. While President Biden is the oldest serving president in U.S. history, there have been no serious indications of incapacitation that would warrant invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. This section has never been used in U.S. history, and it would require a significant and sudden decline in Biden's health or mental capacity for it to be considered. The bar for invoking this amendment is very high, requiring agreement from the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet. Given Biden's current health status and the political implications of such a move, this scenario is highly improbable. (b) 538 projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This is a more plausible scenario. As an incumbent president, Biden has certain advantages in the election forecast. However, his approval ratings have been relatively low, and there are concerns about his age and performance. The political landscape can change significantly in the coming year, and it's difficult to predict with certainty how 538's forecast will look on a specific date. That said, it's not unreasonable to think Biden could be the favorite, especially if the Republican nominee (presumably Trump) faces legal or political challenges. For both events to occur, we would need the extremely unlikely event (a) to happen, followed by Biden somehow remaining the favorite in election forecasts despite being declared incapacitated. This combination of events is extraordinarily improbable. Given the extreme unlikelihood of event (a), and the additional improbability of event (b) occurring in conjunction with (a), the overall probability of both events happening is extremely low."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "360f608f-c4ce-4367-99ba-4911fe6bf8fa", "title": "Will either Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024, or will FiveThirtyEight project Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves to YES if either of the following occurs:\n\n(a) Biden is declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024.

(a) Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024: This scenario is highly unlikely. While Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history and there have been concerns about his age and mental acuity, invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment is an extreme measure that has never been used in U.S. history. It would require the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to agree that the President is unable to discharge his duties, which is a high bar. Given that there have been no serious indications of Biden being incapacitated to this degree, and his administration has shown no signs of considering such a move, the probability of this occurring is very low. (b) FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This scenario is more likely. As of now (July 2023), Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for 2024. Historically, incumbent presidents have an advantage in elections. However, Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, and there are concerns about his age and performance. Trump, on the other hand, faces legal challenges and division within the Republican party. The outcome of this scenario will depend on various factors including the state of the economy, international events, and the campaigns' effectiveness. Given the uncertainties and the time until July 2024, it's difficult to predict with high confidence, but there's a reasonable chance that Biden could be projected as the favorite. Combining these scenarios: Since the question resolves YES if either scenario occurs, we need to consider the probability of at least one of these events happening. The first scenario (a) has a very low probability, while the second scenario (b) has a moderate probability. The overall probability will be dominated by scenario (b). Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability as follows: Probability: 0.55 This probability reflects that while scenario (a) is highly unlikely, there's a slightly better than even chance that Biden could be projected as the favorite by FiveThirtyEight on July 19, 2024.

Historical performance: The BSE SENSEX has shown strong growth over the past decades. In the last 5 years, it has grown from around 35,000 to 62,000, which is about a 77% increase. This suggests that significant growth is possible. 3. Economic factors: India's economy is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. Continued economic growth, foreign investments, and government policies supporting businesses could drive the stock market higher. 4. Global economic conditions: The global economic outlook, including factors like inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, can significantly impact the Indian stock market. 5. Specific range: The question asks for a very specific range (75,000 to 77,000), which is a relatively narrow window of about 2.67% of the lower bound. This specificity reduces the probability. 6.

(b) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early: This scenario is more plausible. The information provided indicates that there is already an effort underway, led by Rep. Jared Huffman, to circulate a letter opposing the DNC's plan for an early virtual nomination of Biden. The fact that \"dozens\" of House Democrats are reportedly organizing around this issue suggests that reaching 20 signatures is quite possible. Several factors increase the likelihood of this occurring: 1. The timeframe (until July 21st) gives organizers sufficient time to gather signatures. 2. There is already momentum and organization behind this effort. 3. The concern about stifling debate within the party is a legitimate issue that could resonate with many Democrats. 4. Some Democrats may want to signal their independence from party leadership or express reservations about Biden's candidacy without directly challenging him. However, there are also factors that could prevent this from happening: 1. Party pressure to maintain unity, especially in an election year. 2. Fear of appearing disloyal to the incumbent president. 3. The possibility that the DNC might modify its plans in response to early pushback, negating the need for a formal letter. Considering both scenarios, (a) is highly unlikely, while (b) has a reasonable chance of occurring. Given the information provided and the current political climate, I would estimate that there's about a 60% chance that at least 20 House/Senate Democrats will sign such a letter by July 21st."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.02979309157172161, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.007448272892930402, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.24513137125626708, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Donald Trump's influence: Despite his controversial presidency and two impeachments, Donald Trump maintains a significant base of support within the Republican Party. He has hinted at running again in 2024 and remains a powerful figure in the party. 2. Other Trump family members: While Donald Trump is the most likely family member to run, other adult Trump children (Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka) have gained political exposure during his presidency. However, they lack direct political experience and have not indicated strong intentions to run. 3. Current political climate: The Republican Party is somewhat divided between Trump loyalists and those seeking to move away from his influence. This division could either strengthen Trump's position or create an opening for a non-Trump candidate. 4. Potential challengers: Several other prominent Republicans, such as Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, and Nikki Haley, have been positioning themselves for a potential 2024 run. These candidates could present strong competition to any Trump family member. 5. Time until the nomination: With the nomination still over a year away, there's ample time for political landscapes to shift and new candidates to emerge or gain traction. 6. Historical precedent: It's uncommon for a former president to run again after losing re-election, though not unprecedented (Grover Cleveland did so successfully). 7. Legal issues: Donald Trump is facing several legal challenges that could potentially impact his ability or decision to run. Considering these factors, Donald Trump remains the most likely Trump family member to secure the nomination, with other family members having a much lower chance. While Trump's base remains strong, there are significant obstacles and strong competition. Probability: 0.55 This probability reflects that while a Trump family member (primarily Donald Trump himself) has a good chance of securing the nomination, it's far from certain. The probability is slightly above 50% due to Trump's continued influence in the party and his strong base, but it also accounts for the significant challenges and competition he or any family member would face."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "ee113034-b1be-4681-9314-7c7a44be09b2", "title": "Facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat, will Trump gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents?", "body": "There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6.

The 3% threshold: The question resolves YES if Trump gains at least 3% more votes when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat. This is a significant difference, requiring a notable shift in voter preference. 4. Timing: The polls close on July 6, 2024, which is relatively close to the 2024 US presidential election. This timing might lead to more accurate predictions as respondents have more information about the candidates and their campaigns. 5.

Additionally, if Manifold users are more politically engaged, they may be more likely to reflect this trend in their voting. However, the 3% threshold is significant and may be challenging to reach.

Historical performance: Albania has participated in Eurovision since 2004. In the past 19 years, they have qualified for the Grand Final 10 times, giving them a qualification rate of about 53%. 2. Recent performance: In the last five years (2019-2023), Albania qualified for the Grand Final three times (2019, 2021, 2022) and failed to qualify twice (2020 was cancelled, 2023). This shows a slightly improved recent performance compared to their overall average. 3.

Semi-final placement: The semi-final in which Albania will compete is not yet known. The draw can sometimes affect qualification chances. 5. Competition: The overall quality of entries from other countries in 2024 is unknown at this point, which could impact Albania's chances. 6. Voting patterns: Albania often receives support from neighboring countries and those with Albanian diaspora populations, which can help in qualification. 7. Changes in format or voting system: Any potential changes to the Eurovision format or voting system for 2024 are not yet known, which could affect qualification chances.

For a brokered convention to occur, there would need to be significant challenges to Biden's candidacy and multiple strong contenders splitting the delegate count. While not impossible, this scenario seems unlikely given the current political landscape. Combining these factors: For the question to resolve as YES, either of these events needs to occur. While both seem unlikely individually, the fact that only one needs to happen increases the overall probability. The polling condition (a) seems more likely than the brokered convention scenario (b).

Time frame: We're forecasting for about 10 days in the future from the current data point. In such a short time, dramatic shifts are less likely unless there's a major event. 3.

The European People's Party (EPP) currently holds the most seats, followed by the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). 2. Recent trends: There has been a rise in right-wing populist and nationalist sentiments across Europe in recent years. This trend could potentially benefit the ID group, which includes parties with these ideologies. 3. Electoral systems: The European Parliament elections use proportional representation, which tends to favor smaller parties compared to first-past-the-post systems. 4. National political landscapes: The performance of ID-affiliated parties in national elections across EU member states has been mixed. While some countries have seen gains for these parties, others have not. 5. Voter turnout: European Parliament elections typically have lower turnout than national elections, which can sometimes benefit more extreme or protest-oriented parties. 6. Current polling: While it's still early, current polls do not indicate that the ID group is likely to become the largest group in the European Parliament. However, polls can change significantly over time. 7.

Current music scene: Luxembourg has a small but diverse music scene, but it's unclear if they have the resources or motivation to mount a competitive Eurovision entry after such a long absence. 4. Qualification process: If Luxembourg were to participate, they would likely need to go through a semi-final round. As a small country with no recent Eurovision experience, qualifying could be challenging. 5. EBU membership: Luxembourg's broadcaster RTL is still a member of the EBU, which means they are eligible to participate if they choose to do so. 6. Time frame: The question was created in April 2024, which is very close to the typical Eurovision dates in May. If Luxembourg had decided to participate, it would likely have been announced much earlier. 7.

The lack of any announcements or preparations so close to the event makes it almost impossible for them to be involved this year.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Current intentions: As of now (June 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024.

Part A: Will Hurd being selected as the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Will Hurd is a former U.S. Representative from Texas who has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, his chances of winning the nomination are extremely low for several reasons: 1. He is not well-known nationally compared to other candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley. 2.

Part B: Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination. Joe Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He has already launched his campaign and is actively fundraising. While there are concerns about his age and some calls within the Democratic Party for a new generation of leadership, several factors make it unlikely that he will withdraw: 1. Incumbency advantage: Sitting presidents rarely choose not to seek re-election. 2. No strong alternative: There isn't a clear successor or alternative candidate who could easily step in. 3. Party unity: The Democratic Party leadership is largely united behind Biden's candidacy. 4. Time frame: The July 15, 2024 deadline is very close to the Democratic National Convention, making a late withdrawal unlikely. However, given Biden's age and the potential for health issues or other unforeseen circumstances, there is a small but non-negligible chance he might withdraw. I would estimate this probability at around 10-15%. Combining both parts, since either condition would result in a YES resolution, we need to calculate the probability of at least one of these events occurring.

Regulatory pressure: Governments and regulatory bodies are increasingly calling for more transparency and safety measures in AI development. This external pressure could motivate Meta to conduct and publish such reports. 4. Competition: Other major tech companies like Google and Microsoft have been more open about their AI safety practices. Meta might feel compelled to follow suit to maintain its competitive edge and public image. 5. Timeframe: The question gives almost a full year (from July 2023 to June 2024) for Meta to conduct and publish such a report, which is a reasonable amount of time for this kind of initiative. 6. Meta's history: While Meta has been involved in AI research and development, they have sometimes been slower than other tech giants in publicly addressing certain issues or publishing comprehensive reports. 7. Recent developments: Meta has been more actively participating in AI discussions and has released some of its AI models. This increased engagement in the AI space might lead to more transparency and safety initiatives. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Meta will publish such a report by the given deadline. The growing industry trend, regulatory pressure, and competitive landscape all push in this direction. However, Meta's sometimes cautious approach to public disclosures and the specific requirement for external red-teaming introduce some uncertainty."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "dba77d13-a72a-4c9c-a205-ee875582110b", "title": "Will the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15?

Given these factors, it seems quite likely that the market will reach 377 traders: - The existing base of 299 traders is already substantial. - Only 78 more traders are needed over a period of about 11 months. - The self-referential nature of the market could drive additional participation. - The creator appears to have some following that could help promote the market.

(a) Meta publishing a safety red-teaming report by June 30, 2024: Meta (formerly Facebook) has been increasingly involved in AI development, including large language models. Given the growing emphasis on AI safety and transparency in the tech industry, it's plausible that Meta would conduct external red-teaming for their AI models. However, there are a few factors to consider: 1. Time frame: We have almost a full year until the deadline, which gives Meta ample time to conduct and publish such a report. 2. Industry trends: Other major AI companies like OpenAI and Google have published similar safety reports, which might encourage Meta to follow suit. 3. Regulatory pressure: Increasing scrutiny from governments and regulatory bodies might push Meta to be more transparent about their AI safety measures. However, Meta has not always been the most transparent company, and they might choose to keep such reports internal. The probability of this part happening is moderate, around 40-50%. (b) The linked market getting at least 377 traders by July 15, 2024: For this part, we need to consider the dynamics of prediction markets: 1. Time frame: We have almost a full year for this market to gather traders, which is a significant amount of time. 2.

Given these factors, reaching 377 traders in a year seems quite achievable. The probability of this part happening is relatively high, around 70-80%. Combining both parts, since we only need one of these to occur for a YES resolution, we can use the complement of the probability that both fail: P(YES) = 1 - (1 - P(a)) * (1 - P(b)). Using conservative estimates: P(YES) = 1 - (1 - 0.4) * (1 - 0.7) = 1 - 0.6 * 0.3 = 1 - 0.18 = 0.82.

Factors affecting performance: Song quality, staging, and performer charisma play crucial roles in qualification. These factors are unknown at this time for Eurovision 2024. Voting patterns: Neither country has strong diaspora voting or consistent voting allies, which can be disadvantageous. Probability of both qualifying: For both countries to qualify, they each need to be in the top 10 of their respective semi-finals.

Given these factors, we can estimate that Czechia might have around a 40-45% chance of qualifying, while San Marino might have a 25-30% chance.

Trump's involvement in January 6th: The events of January 6th, 2021, and Trump's role in them are central to arguments for his disqualification under the 14th Amendment.

Let's analyze each separately: (a) Fidesz-KDNP maintaining its EU plurality from Hungary in 2024: Fidesz-KDNP, led by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has been the dominant political force in Hungary for over a decade. They have maintained a strong grip on power through various means, including media control and electoral system changes. However, there has been growing opposition and discontent with Orb\u00e1n's policies, both domestically and within the EU. The European Parliament elections are scheduled for June 6-9, 2024, which is within the timeframe of this question. While Fidesz-KDNP's position may be somewhat weakened, their established base and political machinery make it likely they will still secure a plurality of Hungarian seats. (b) EU announcing new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024: The EU has been increasingly concerned about the rapid growth of Chinese electric vehicle imports and their potential impact on European manufacturers. In September 2023, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles, which could lead to tariffs. Such investigations typically take 13 months, which would put the conclusion beyond the July 5, 2024 deadline. However, there's a possibility of interim measures or an accelerated process given the political and economic importance of the issue. The EU has shown a willingness to take protective measures in strategic industries, and the automotive sector is crucial for many EU countries.

Popularity of Moana: The movie has been a significant success for Disney, and its popularity has remained strong since its release in 2016. This makes it a good candidate for a themed attraction. 2. Existing Moana presence: Disney has already incorporated Moana into its parks in various ways, including meet-and-greets and the 'Journey of Water' attraction at EPCOT. This shows Disney's commitment to the franchise. 3. Magic Kingdom's current offerings: Magic Kingdom is Disney World's flagship park, and it's always looking for new attractions to keep visitors engaged. A Moana ride could be a fresh addition to the park's lineup. 4. Disney's recent focus: Disney has been investing heavily in its parks and has shown a tendency to create immersive experiences based on popular IP. A Moana ride would fit this trend. 5. Timing: The question specifies D23 2024, which gives Disney ample time to develop and finalize plans for such an attraction. Major announcements are often made at D23 events. 6. Competition with Universal: With Universal's Epic Universe park opening in 2025, Disney might be looking to announce new attractions to maintain interest and competitiveness. 7. Previous announcements: Disney has a history of announcing new rides and attractions at D23 events, making this a plausible venue for such an announcement. However, there are also factors that might reduce the likelihood: 1. Recent financial challenges: Disney has faced some financial pressures recently, which might make them more cautious about announcing new, expensive attractions. 2. Other priorities: Disney might choose to focus on other IPs or park areas for their next major announcement. 3. Specificity of the question: The question is very specific about the ride being for Magic Kingdom, not any other park, which narrows the possibilities. 4. Recent Moana additions: With the new 'Journey of Water' attraction at EPCOT, Disney might feel they've sufficiently represented Moana in their Florida parks for now. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of this happening.

(a) Disney announcing a new Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024: Disney has been expanding its IP-based attractions, and Moana is a popular franchise. The success of the recent Moana animated series and the upcoming live-action film suggests Disney might want to capitalize on the character's popularity. However, Disney has not officially hinted at such a ride, and theme park announcements can be unpredictable. The specific requirement for Magic Kingdom (not any other park) reduces the likelihood. D23 is a major event for Disney announcements, but there's no guarantee this specific ride will be announced. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this part at around 30%. (b) Deadpool & Wolverine having the biggest opening weekend ever for an R-rated movie: The projections are very optimistic, estimating $340-360 million globally. The current record is $284.5 million, set by the original Deadpool. Factors in favor: Combining two popular Marvel characters (Deadpool and Wolverine), Ryan Reynolds' star power, Marvel's strong brand and marketing machine, increased number of theaters compared to the original Deadpool. Factors against: R-rating limits audience, potential audience fatigue with superhero movies, economic factors affecting moviegoing.

Part A: Disney announcing a new Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024. Disney has been investing heavily in IP-based attractions, and Moana is a popular property. The success of the Moana animated series and the announcement of a live-action film suggest Disney is keen to capitalize on this IP. However, Magic Kingdom already has many attractions, and space for new rides is limited. The question specifies that it must be announced for Magic Kingdom specifically, not other parks. The requirement for a firm announcement rather than 'spitballing ideas' sets a higher bar. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this part occurring at around 20-25%. Part B: Deadpool & Wolverine having the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie. The Deadpool franchise has a strong track record, with the original holding the current record. The addition of Wolverine, a hugely popular character, is likely to increase interest. This film is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which typically draws large audiences. The $284.5M global opening weekend target is high but not unreasonable given inflation and the combined star power. However, R-rated films have a ceiling on their audience due to age restrictions. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this part occurring at around 60-65%. To calculate the overall probability, we need to consider the chance of either event occurring. The probability of at least one of two independent events occurring is given by: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

Major party candidates rarely drop out this late in the election cycle unless there are extraordinary circumstances. 5.

Greens\u2013EFA holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections: The Greens\u2013EFA currently holds 72 seats out of 705 in the European Parliament, which is far from the largest group. The largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) with 176 seats and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) with 145 seats. For the Greens\u2013EFA to become the largest group, they would need to more than double their seats, which is highly unlikely. Recent polls and trends do not suggest such a dramatic shift in European politics. The probability of this occurring is very low, estimated at around 0.05 or 5%. 2. OpenAI's ChatGPT being generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024: As of now, ChatGPT is available in the EU, but there are ongoing discussions about AI regulation in the region. The EU is working on the AI Act, which could potentially impact the availability of AI systems like ChatGPT. However, the Act is still in development and its final form and implementation timeline are uncertain. Given that ChatGPT is currently available and there's a strong market demand for AI services, it's more likely than not that it will remain available in some form, even if with additional regulations or safeguards. The probability of ChatGPT being generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, is estimated at around 0.7 or 70%.

This short time frame suggests that dramatic shifts are less likely, but small changes are certainly possible. 3.

However, given the short timeframe, this is less likely to cause dramatic shifts. 5. Polling methodology: 538's polling average is generally considered reliable and tends to smooth out short-term fluctuations. 6. Election proximity: As we get closer to the election (November 2024), polls tend to become more stable and accurate. Given that Trump's lead is already at 2.4 points on July 5, it's quite plausible that it could remain within the 2 to 3 point range by July 15. The current lead is already close to the middle of our target range, which gives some buffer for small fluctuations in either direction.

Current polls show a close race between Trump and Biden, with some variation depending on the source. 538 is known for its aggregated polling data, which tends to be more reliable than individual polls. A lead of 2-3 points is relatively narrow and within the realm of possibility given current political dynamics.

Recent events, including Iran's support for Hamas and Hezbollah, and its nuclear program, have further heightened tensions. 2.

This increases the likelihood of Israeli retaliation. 5. International pressure: The international community, particularly the United States, may attempt to discourage Israel from carrying out a direct attack on Iranian soil to prevent further escalation in the region. 6. Israeli capabilities: Israel has demonstrated the ability to conduct sophisticated operations within Iran, but a larger-scale attack resulting in at least five deaths would be a significant escalation from previous actions. 7. Iranian defenses: Iran has been improving its air defenses and internal security, which could make it more challenging for Israel to conduct a successful attack. 8.

(a) Tucker Carlson as Republican nominee for 2024: Tucker Carlson is a popular conservative media figure, but he has not officially declared his intention to run for president. The current frontrunner for the Republican nomination is former President Donald Trump, followed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Other potential candidates like Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, and Tim Scott have more political experience than Carlson. While Carlson has a significant following, it's highly unlikely that he would secure the nomination given the strong competition and his lack of political experience. The probability of this occurring is very low, perhaps around 1%. (b) Republican Party retaining Ohio's 6th congressional district in 2024: Ohio's 6th congressional district has been a Republican stronghold for many years. In the 2022 election, Republican Bill Johnson won with 67.4% of the vote. The district has consistently voted Republican in recent elections, and there's no indication of a significant shift in voter demographics or preferences. Given the historical voting patterns and the current political climate, it's highly likely that the Republicans will retain this seat in a special election. The probability of this occurring is very high, perhaps around 90%. Combining the probabilities: Since we only need one of these events to occur for the question to resolve as YES, we can use the probability rule for the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). P(A) = 0.01 (Tucker Carlson nomination) P(B) = 0.90 (Republicans retaining Ohio's 6th district) P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.01 * 0.90 = 0.009 (assuming independence) P(A or B) = 0.01 + 0.90 - 0.009 = 0.901.

Historical context: The VXVCLS is a measure of expected volatility in the S&P 500 index over the next 3 months. It tends to increase during periods of market uncertainty and decrease during periods of stability. 2. Current market conditions: As of April 2024, we're experiencing a relatively stable market with moderate volatility. The exact VXVCLS value for July 20, 2023, isn't provided, but we can assume it was at a moderate level given the overall market conditions in 2023. 3. Time frame: The question asks about the index value on July 20, 2024, which is about 15 months from now. This is a significant time period during which many factors can change. 4. Economic factors: The volatility index can be influenced by various economic factors such as interest rates, inflation, GDP growth, and geopolitical events. Any significant changes in these areas could impact the VXVCLS. 5. Market cycles: The stock market tends to go through cycles of bull and bear markets. If we're currently in a bull market, there's a possibility that we might be approaching a correction or bear market by July 2024, which could increase volatility. 6. Upcoming events: The U.S. presidential election in November 2024 could potentially increase market uncertainty and volatility in the months leading up to it, including July 2024. 7. Technological and global factors: Rapid technological changes, climate-related events, or global conflicts could also contribute to increased market volatility. Given these factors, there's a reasonable chance that the VXVCLS could be higher in July 2024 compared to July 2023. The potential for increased uncertainty due to the upcoming U.S. election, possible market cycle changes, and the general unpredictability of global events over a 15-month period all contribute to this likelihood. However, it's important to note that predicting market volatility this far in advance is inherently challenging and subject to significant uncertainty. The market could also experience a period of unusual stability, which would lead to lower volatility.

Predicting its exact value more than a year in advance is challenging, as it depends on various economic factors and market sentiment. However, we can consider some general trends: 1. The volatility index tends to increase during periods of economic uncertainty or market stress. 2. As of 2023, there are ongoing concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential economic slowdowns. 3. 2024 is a U.S. presidential election year, which could introduce additional market uncertainty.

There's ongoing tension between Israel and Iran, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear program. 2. Israel has been accused of carrying out covert operations in Iran in the past. 3. The timeframe (before May 1, 2024) is relatively short, which somewhat reduces the likelihood. 4. The threshold for 'deadly attack' is set at five individuals, which is a significant action.

This indicates a lack of national support and recognition compared to other candidates. 5. Timing: With the Republican National Convention typically held in the summer before the election, there is still time for the field to change. However, starting a campaign this late would be a significant disadvantage. 6. Political experience: Youngkin's political experience is limited compared to many other candidates, having only been in office since 2022. This could be seen as a weakness by Republican voters and delegates. 7. Fundraising and organization: There's no evidence that Youngkin has built the necessary national fundraising network or campaign organization required for a presidential run. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Glenn Youngkin will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

While Biden's age is a factor (he'll be 81 in July 2024), he has not shown any signs of intending to resign. Impeachment and removal from office is extremely rare and unlikely without a major scandal. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 95%. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.275 (midpoint of 25-30%) * 0.95 = 0.26125.

For example, in Tokyo 2020, only three countries (Bermuda, Philippines, and Qatar) won their first gold medals. In Rio 2016, it was two (Fiji and Kosovo). The trend suggests that it's becoming increasingly difficult for new countries to win their first gold as the competition becomes more intense and established sporting nations continue to dominate. However, Paris 2024 will feature some new sports like breaking (breakdancing), which could provide opportunities for new countries to excel. Still, reaching 5 debut gold medal winners seems unlikely based on recent trends. 2. Individual Neutral Athletes winning at least 15 gold medals: This condition likely refers to Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag due to the ongoing ban on Russia for state-sponsored doping. In Tokyo 2020, competing as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), they won 20 gold medals. However, the situation for Paris 2024 is different: - The ban on Russia is still in effect, and the IOC has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes compete as neutral individuals without national symbols. - The number of Russian athletes allowed to compete may be significantly reduced compared to the ROC delegation in Tokyo. - Some sports federations have outright banned Russian athletes from competing. Given these restrictions, it seems highly unlikely that Individual Neutral Athletes would be able to win 15 or more gold medals. The reduced number of participants and the psychological impact of competing without national representation would likely result in fewer medals than the ROC won in Tokyo.

(a) At least 5 countries winning their debut gold medal: This is a challenging feat, as most countries that have the potential to win Olympic gold medals have likely already done so in previous games. However, there are still some factors to consider: 1. New countries participating for the first time or relatively new countries improving their athletic programs. 2. Changes in Olympic sports or new events being introduced, which could give opportunities to countries specializing in those areas. 3. Historical data: In recent Olympics, it's rare for 5 or more countries to win their first gold medal.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that 5 or more countries will win their debut gold medal in Paris 2024. (b) Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals: This part is more complex due to the current geopolitical situation: 1. 'Individual Neutral Athletes' typically refers to athletes from countries that are banned from competing under their national flag, most notably Russian athletes in recent years due to doping scandals. 2. The status of Russian and Belarusian athletes for Paris 2024 is still uncertain due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. 3. If Russian athletes are allowed to compete as neutral athletes, they have the potential to win multiple gold medals, as Russia is traditionally a strong Olympic performer. 4. However, 15 gold medals is a very high number, even for a strong sporting nation. For context, in Tokyo 2020, the Russian Olympic Committee (competing under a neutral flag) won 20 gold medals total. Given the uncertainty surrounding the participation of Russian athletes and the high threshold of 15 gold medals, this scenario also seems unlikely.

Liz Cheney being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: The probability of this happening is extremely low. Liz Cheney has become a polarizing figure within the Republican Party due to her opposition to former President Donald Trump and her role in the January 6th committee. She lost her House seat in Wyoming's Republican primary in 2022, indicating a lack of support from her own party. The Republican base currently favors candidates who align more closely with Trump's policies and rhetoric. Given these factors, it's highly unlikely that Cheney would secure the Republican nomination. 2. Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination: While this is more plausible than the first scenario, it's still relatively unlikely. Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He officially announced his re-election campaign on April 25, 2023. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have remained committed to his candidacy. It would be unusual and potentially damaging to the Democratic Party for an incumbent president to withdraw so late in the election cycle. However, we must consider that unforeseen circumstances such as health issues or a significant drop in approval ratings could potentially lead to such an announcement. While unlikely, this scenario is more probable than Cheney becoming the Republican nominee. Combining these two scenarios, the overall probability of either event occurring is still quite low. The Cheney scenario is extremely improbable, while the Biden scenario, though unlikely, carries a slightly higher possibility due to potential unforeseen circumstances. Probability: 0.08 This low probability reflects the very slim chance of Liz Cheney becoming the Republican nominee (estimated at less than 1%) combined with the somewhat higher but still unlikely possibility of Biden withdrawing (estimated around 7-8%).

Historical trends: In recent elections, polls have tended to tighten as the election approaches. However, this far out from the election (over a year), polls are less predictive and more volatile. 2. Current political climate: As of now (2023), Trump is facing multiple legal challenges, which could affect public perception. However, he also maintains a strong base of support. 3. Economic factors: The state of the economy in 2024 will likely play a significant role in voter preferences. Any economic downturn could hurt Biden, while improvements might help him. 4. Biden's incumbency: Incumbents typically have an advantage, but Biden's age and perceived effectiveness could be factors working against him. 5. Polling accuracy: 538's polling average is generally considered reliable, but polls can be wrong or biased, especially this far out from the election. 6. Specific date: The question asks about July 15, 2024, which is close to the party conventions (typically held in July or August). This timing could influence poll numbers as each party rallies support. 7. Narrow range: The question specifically asks if Trump's lead will be between 2 and 3 points, which is a very narrow range. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Trump's lead would fall exactly in this narrow 2-3 point range. While it's possible Trump could be leading at this point, the specific range is quite restrictive. Polls this far out are often not predictive of the final result, and the race could easily be closer or further apart than this range.

However, without specific recent data, we can assume she's maintaining a high level of performance based on her track record. 3. Age: Hassan will be 31 years old during the 2024 Olympics. While this is not young for a distance runner, many athletes have performed well at this age and beyond in endurance events. 4. Competition: The level of competition in women's distance running is always high, with new talents emerging and established stars maintaining their form.

They have dominated these events in recent Olympics and other international competitions. However, winning both men's and women's marathons is still a challenging feat. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Kenyan athletes (many of whom are Kalenjin) won gold in the men's marathon but silver in the women's. In the 2016 Rio Olympics, Kenyans won gold in both events. The competition is always fierce, with strong runners from Ethiopia, Japan, and other countries. Given their track record, there's a good chance of Kalenjin athletes winning both events, but it's far from certain.

However, several factors make this less likely: a) Israel is not a member of the ICC, which complicates the court's jurisdiction. b) The ICC typically takes years to investigate and issue warrants, and the deadline is relatively soon (July 1, 2024). c) There would likely be intense diplomatic pressure against such a move, particularly from the United States. d) The ICC tends to focus on the most severe cases and may be hesitant to target sitting government officials of a powerful country. However, the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the increasing international scrutiny on Israel's actions do increase the possibility of this occurring. Combining these scenarios, we have one highly unlikely event and one unlikely but more plausible event.

In 2023, their entry 'We Are One' by Wild Youth finished 11th in their semi-final, just missing out on qualification. 3. Selection process: Ireland typically uses a national selection process or internal selection to choose their entry. The quality of the chosen song and performer will be crucial to their chances. 4. Competition level: The overall quality of entries in Eurovision has been increasing, making it more challenging for countries to qualify. 5. Voting patterns: Ireland often receives support from countries with large Irish diaspora populations, such as the UK and Australia, which can help in the semi-finals. 6. Staging and performance: The visual presentation and live vocal performance on the night will play a significant role in their chances. 7. Running order: The position in which Ireland performs in their semi-final can affect their chances, with later positions generally considered more favorable. 8. Potential changes: There's always the possibility of rule changes or adjustments to the voting system that could impact qualification chances. Given these factors, Ireland's chances of qualifying are not particularly high, but also not negligible. Their recent near-miss in 2023 suggests they are capable of producing competitive entries. However, their consistent failure to qualify in recent years indicates persistent challenges. Considering all these factors, I would estimate that Ireland has a moderate chance of qualifying for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024, but it's still more likely that they won't qualify than that they will."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "67fb25f1-13f0-408d-9a06-336d76c15053", "title": "Will both Iceland and Ireland qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Iceland and Ireland participate in a Semi-final and are officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

While there has been some speculation about his age and fitness for office, he has consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. The Democratic Party has also shown strong support for his candidacy. For Biden to announce he won't accept the nomination would be a major political shift and is quite unlikely. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 10%.

Christie's previous presidential run in 2016 was unsuccessful, and his criticism of Trump has alienated him from a significant portion of the Republican base. The probability of Christie securing the nomination seems very low, perhaps around 1-2%.

While he hasn't been specifically charged with witness tampering yet, there have been allegations and investigations into potential witness intimidation. Given the ongoing legal scrutiny and Trump's history of making public statements about witnesses and the case, it's not implausible that he could face such charges. However, it's not certain, and prosecutors would need strong evidence to bring such charges. The likelihood of this occurring might be around 20-30%. Combining these probabilities, we need to consider that only one of these events needs to happen for the question to resolve YES. Using the principle of probability of either event occurring, we can calculate: P(Either) = P(Biden) + P(Trump) - P(Biden AND Trump). Given the independence of these events, the probability of both occurring is negligible and can be disregarded. Therefore, the combined probability is approximately the sum of the individual probabilities, which would be around 21-32%. Considering all factors, I would lean towards the lower end of this range due to the overall unlikelihood of these events."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.009294831226850875, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0023237078067127187, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15322184541517253, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For Harris to become President or Acting President, something drastic would need to happen to President Biden, such as a severe health crisis, resignation, or impeachment. There are no current indications of any such events being imminent or likely. Biden appears to be in stable health for his age and continues to perform his duties.

Part B: 20+ House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing early Biden nomination - This scenario is more plausible but still unlikely. The Democratic Party generally tries to present a united front, especially concerning presidential nominations. However, there have been some concerns raised about Biden's age and electability. The early nomination plan might be seen by some as an attempt to forestall potential challengers or debates about Biden's fitness for office.

(a) Will Hurd being the Republican nominee: Will Hurd is a former U.S. Representative from Texas who has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, he is currently considered a long-shot candidate for several reasons: 1. He has low name recognition compared to other candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley. 2. His moderate stance on some issues may not align with the current Republican base. 3. He has been critical of Donald Trump, which could be a significant disadvantage given Trump's continued influence in the party. 4. Current polling shows him with very low support among Republican voters. Given these factors, the probability of Will Hurd becoming the Republican nominee is extremely low, likely less than 1%. (b) The Democratic Presidential Nominee being a woman: The current situation for the Democratic nomination is as follows: 1. Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has announced his intention to run for re-election. 2. Historically, incumbent presidents rarely face serious primary challenges. 3. There are currently no high-profile female candidates challenging Biden for the nomination. 4. While there is some discussion about potential alternatives to Biden due to concerns about his age, most prominent potential female candidates (e.g., Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren) have expressed support for Biden's re-election bid. However, there is still a possibility that Biden could decide not to run (due to health issues or other unforeseen circumstances), which could open the field to other candidates, including women. Additionally, if Biden's popularity significantly declines, it could potentially lead to a serious primary challenge, possibly from a female candidate. Considering these factors, the probability of a woman becoming the Democratic nominee is low but not negligible, perhaps around 10-15%.

The question was created on July 4, which means these polls are very short-term and may not capture significant shifts in opinion. Generally, voters tend to prefer a generic candidate over a specific one, as they can project their ideal qualities onto the generic option. Biden, being a known quantity with both supporters and detractors, might perform slightly worse than a generic Democrat. However, a 3% shift is quite significant for such a short polling period. It's possible, but not highly likely. (b) Kamala Harris picks either Kelly or Shapiro as her VP: This part is more straightforward but also involves some uncertainty. Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are indeed strong contenders for the VP position, but there are usually many factors considered in VP selection, including geographical balance, demographic appeal, and complementary skills. While Kelly and Shapiro are favorites, there's still a good chance Harris might choose someone else to balance the ticket or appeal to a different demographic. Moreover, VP selections can often be surprising, with candidates sometimes choosing less obvious running mates. Considering both parts together, we need only one of these events to occur for the question to resolve as YES. This significantly increases the probability. If we assume each part has roughly a 30-40% chance of occurring independently (which is a rough estimate based on the analysis above), the probability of at least one of them occurring would be higher. Probability: 0.55 The probability is slightly above 50% because while neither outcome is highly likely on its own, the combination of two possible paths to a YES resolution increases the overall likelihood.

Their historical performance suggests they have a slightly better than 50% chance of qualifying, but their recent failure to qualify and the unknowns regarding their 2024 entry and the competition make it difficult to be more confident."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "0c9f7706-3831-4945-ba1e-b2b54db46c90", "title": "Will both Croatia and Malta qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both Croatia and Malta participate in their respective Semi-finals and are then officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Historical performance: Croatia has qualified for the Grand Final 6 out of 11 times since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004. Malta has a better track record, qualifying 7 out of 11 times in the same period. 2. Recent performance: Croatia qualified for the Grand Final in 2023 with the song 'Mama \u0160\u010c!' by Let 3, finishing 13th. Malta failed to qualify in 2023 with 'Dance (Our Own Party)' by The Busker. 3. Eurovision voting patterns: Both countries have some reliable voting allies, which can help in qualification. Croatia often receives support from neighboring Balkan countries. Malta tends to receive support from some Mediterranean countries and the UK. 4. Quality of entries: As of now (April 2024), we don't know the specific songs or artists for 2024, which adds uncertainty. Both countries have shown the ability to send competitive entries in recent years. 5. Semi-final allocation: The semi-final allocation is not yet known, which could impact their chances depending on the competition in each semi-final. 6. Number of qualifiers: Typically, 10 countries qualify from each semi-final, out of approximately 16-18 participants. Given these factors, both countries have a reasonable chance of qualifying, but it's far from certain. Croatia's recent success and Malta's overall good track record are positive indicators. However, the uncertainty about their 2024 entries and the semi-final allocation adds risk. For both to qualify, we need two independent events to occur. If we estimate each country's individual chances at around 60% (slightly above average given their past performance), the probability of both qualifying would be approximately 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36. However, considering the recent trend and the uncertainty involved, I would adjust this slightly downward."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "bde81815-20e5-4787-9789-9eb86c03429a", "title": "Will either Croatia or Malta qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if either of the following occurs: (a) Croatia participates in a Semi-final and is then officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, or (b) Malta participates in a Semi-final and is then officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Malta failed to qualify in 2022 and 2023, suggesting a recent struggle. 3. Eurovision voting patterns: Both countries have some consistent voting allies, which can help in qualification. Neither country is considered a powerhouse in the contest, but they're not typically seen as underdogs either. 4. Quality of entries: As of now, we don't know the quality of their 2024 entries, which is a significant factor in qualification chances. 5. Semi-final allocation: The distribution of countries in each semi-final can affect qualification chances, but this information is not available yet. 6. Combined chances: Having two countries increases the overall probability of a 'Yes' resolution, as only one needs to qualify. Given these factors, I believe there's a good chance that at least one of these countries will qualify. Croatia's recent success and Malta's generally good track record both contribute positively. The fact that we have two chances (either country qualifying leads to a 'Yes') also increases the probability. However, there are uncertainties, such as the quality of their future entries and the semi-final allocations, which prevent us from being overly confident."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.03983451659907017, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.009958629149767542, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28348897958012403, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
