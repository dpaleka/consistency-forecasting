Song quality and performance: The most crucial factor is the quality of Denmark's entry, which we don't know at this point. A strong song and performance can overcome recent poor results. 6. Voting patterns: While not as pronounced as in some other countries, Denmark does benefit from some regional voting from Nordic countries, which could help their chances. 7. Running order: The position in the running order can affect voting, but this is unknown at this stage. Given Denmark's overall Eurovision history and their ability to produce competitive entries, they have a reasonable chance of qualifying. However, their recent string of non-qualifications is a significant concern. The qualification of Slovenia and Lithuania doesn't provide much additional information about Denmark's chances.

Based on these factors: Lithuania seems to have the highest chance of qualifying, given their consistent recent performance.

However, significant changes are less likely to occur within a single week without major events. 4. Kamala Harris's current role: As the incumbent Vice President, Harris has a high profile but also faces scrutiny tied to the administration's performance. 5. Political climate: Without specific information about upcoming events or announcements, it's difficult to predict a sudden shift in Harris's favor within a week. 6. Nate Silver's model: Silver's models are known for being robust and not easily swayed by short-term fluctuations, preferring to account for longer-term trends. 7.

Given these factors, I believe there's a slightly lower than even chance of Harris's odds increasing in the next week.

There are several factors to consider: Joe Biden is currently 81 years old (as of 2024), which puts him at higher risk of health issues compared to younger individuals. However, as the sitting President, he receives excellent medical care and constant monitoring, which significantly reduces the risk of sudden, unexpected death. There have been no recent reports of Biden facing any severe health crisis that would suggest an imminent risk of death. The timeframe for this event is very short - only about three weeks from the question's creation date to the resolution date for Biden's potential death. The probability of any specific individual dying within such a short timeframe is generally very low, barring known severe health issues or external threats.

However, he has maintained that he is fit for office. 4. Political landscape: The Democratic Party currently has no strong alternative candidates who could easily step in if Biden were to withdraw. 5. Timing: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is before the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August).

This could potentially lead to capital outflows from emerging markets like India, as investors might prefer the safety of the US dollar. However, a strong dollar can also benefit Indian IT companies and exporters, which are significant components of the SENSEX. 2. Joe Biden's withdrawal from the Democratic nomination: If Biden announces he won't seek re-election before July 15, 2024, it could create political uncertainty in the US. This might lead to increased global market volatility, potentially affecting the Indian market as well. 3.

To reach 75,000-76,000 by July 21, 2024, it would need to grow by approximately 15% in a year. This is not unprecedented but would require significant positive sentiment and economic growth. 4. Time frame: The resolution date is about a year from now, which leaves room for many economic and geopolitical developments that could influence the market. 5. Specific range: The question asks for a very narrow range (75,000 to 76,000), which makes it less likely to occur compared to a broader range. 6. Indian economic factors: India's economic growth, inflation rates, corporate earnings, and government policies will play crucial roles in determining the SENSEX level. Given these factors, while it's possible for the SENSEX to reach the 75,000-76,000 range by July 21, 2024, it's a very specific outcome that requires multiple conditions to align perfectly.

Historical precedent: In previous elections, the process of electing a president has been relatively swift once the new parliament is in place. 5. Potential delays: While unlikely, there could be unforeseen circumstances that delay the election or the subsequent presidential election by the National Assembly. 6.

Given these factors, it seems highly likely that South Africa will elect a president before July 1, 2024.

Condition 1 - South African presidential election: South Africa is scheduled to hold its general election in 2024, but the exact date hasn't been set yet. Typically, the president is elected by the National Assembly shortly after the general election. Given that the condition requires this to happen before July 1, 2024, it's quite likely this condition will be met, as South African elections are usually held in the first half of the year. 2. Condition 2 - Market traders: The requirement of 377 traders by July 15, 2024, seems achievable.

With over a month between the question's creation and the trader deadline, reaching 377 traders is plausible. 3. Outcome - 30% agreement on weak AGI achievement: This is the most uncertain aspect of the question. Weak AGI is a somewhat ambiguous concept, and people's opinions on whether it has been achieved can vary widely. Several factors to consider: a) Recent advancements: AI has been progressing rapidly, with models like GPT-4 showing impressive capabilities. By July 2024, there could be even more advanced systems. b) Lack of clear definition: The poll doesn't provide a definition of weak AGI, allowing for subjective interpretations. This could lead to a higher percentage of YES votes if people use a loose definition. c) Public perception: Media coverage and public discourse around AI capabilities can significantly influence people's opinions, potentially leading to overestimation of AI progress. d) Expert skepticism: Many AI researchers are cautious about claiming AGI achievements, which could influence public opinion. e) Timeframe: The short period between the question's creation and resolution (less than two months) limits the likelihood of major breakthroughs that would convince a large portion of respondents. Given these factors, while it's possible that 30% of respondents might agree that weak AGI has been achieved, it seems more likely that the percentage will be lower.

OpenAI's track record and commitment to AI safety: OpenAI has shown a strong commitment to AI safety and transparency. They have published several technical reports and papers discussing the capabilities and limitations of their models. This suggests they are likely to continue this practice. 2. External pressure and regulatory environment: With ChatGPT being available in the EU, OpenAI will be subject to EU regulations, which may include requirements for transparency and safety assessments. This could increase the likelihood of publishing an external red-teaming report. 3. Geopolitical tensions: The diplomatic actions between the Philippines and China, while seemingly unrelated, could potentially increase global tensions and heighten concerns about AI safety and security. This might indirectly pressure AI companies to demonstrate their commitment to safety. 4. Timing: The question asks about a report by June 30, 2024, which gives OpenAI more than a year from the current date to conduct and publish such a report. This timeframe seems reasonable for completing and publishing a red-teaming exercise. 5. Industry trends: As AI capabilities advance, there's an increasing trend towards transparency and safety assessments in the AI industry. OpenAI, as a leader in the field, is likely to participate in and potentially lead such initiatives. 6. Previous behavior: OpenAI has conducted and published results of external evaluations before, such as their collaboration with Anthropic on AI safety. This precedent increases the likelihood of them doing so again. However, there are some factors that might reduce the probability: 1. Competitive concerns: OpenAI might be hesitant to publish detailed safety reports that could reveal sensitive information about their models or methodologies. 2. Resource allocation: Conducting and publishing an external red-teaming report requires significant resources. OpenAI might prioritize other activities over this specific type of report. 3. Potential negative findings: If the red-teaming exercise uncovers significant safety issues, OpenAI might choose to address these internally before publishing a report.

Current polling trends: As of July 5, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points according to 538's national polling average. This suggests that Trump has some momentum, but it's not quite at the 3-4 point range we're looking for. 2. Time frame: We're looking at the situation about 10 days into the future from the current data point. A lot can happen in 10 days in a presidential race, but typically, barring major events, polling averages don't shift dramatically in such a short period. 3. Historical volatility: Presidential polls tend to fluctuate, but usually within a certain range. A shift of 0.6 to 1.6 points over 10 days is possible but not guaranteed. 4. Upcoming events: We don't have information about specific events scheduled between July 5 and July 15 that could significantly impact the polls. However, the summer before an election is often a time of increased campaign activity. 5. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points. This means small changes in the average could be due to statistical noise rather than real shifts in voter preference. 6. Narrow range: The question asks for a very specific range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4). This is a relatively narrow window, which makes it less likely to occur compared to a broader range. Given these factors, it seems possible but not highly probable that Trump's lead will fall exactly in this range. There's a chance his lead could increase from 2.4 to over 3 points, but it would need to stop short of exceeding 4 points. This specific scenario is less likely than Trump's lead either remaining below 3 points or potentially exceeding 4 points if there's a significant shift in his favor."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "3a947a34-bc87-4b4e-85db-ef2fce90cf39", "title": "Given Trump's lead over Biden is between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, will at least 30% of Manifold respondents agree that weak AGI had been achieved before July 23, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points according to 538's national polling average.

Trump's lead over Biden: The scenario assumes Trump is leading Biden by 3-4 points in July 2024. This suggests a significant shift in political sentiment compared to the 2020 election, which could indicate broader societal changes. 2. Weak AGI achievement: The question asks about the perception of weak AGI achievement, not whether it has actually been achieved. This is important because public perception can be influenced by various factors, including media coverage and technological advancements. 3. Timeframe: The period between the polling date (July 15) and the AGI achievement date (July 23) is very short, just over a week. This suggests that any major AGI breakthrough would likely have occurred before July 15. 4. Lack of definition for weak AGI: The poll doesn't define weak AGI, which means responses will be based on individual interpretations. This could lead to a higher percentage of positive responses, as people might have varying thresholds for what constitutes weak AGI. 5. Current AI progress: As of 2023, there have been significant advancements in AI, but weak AGI hasn't been achieved yet. The question is set about a year in the future, which allows for further progress. 6. Correlation between political shifts and technological progress: A significant lead for Trump might indicate a change in the overall societal landscape, which could include accelerated technological progress or changed perceptions about AI. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that at least 30% of respondents would agree that weak AGI had been achieved. The lack of a clear definition for weak AGI, combined with potential technological advancements and possible shifts in public perception (as indicated by the political change), could lead to a higher percentage of positive responses. However, achieving weak AGI is a significant milestone that would likely generate substantial media attention. The short timeframe and the fact that weak AGI hasn't been achieved as of 2023 suggest that there's still a considerable chance that less than 30% would agree.

The probability of this occurring is moderate, perhaps around 20-25%. 3. Joe Biden announcing he's dropping out and resigning before the end of July 2024: This is an extremely unlikely scenario.

The likelihood of Joe Biden not seeking re-election: While this is a hypothetical scenario, it's important to note that as of now, Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. A sudden withdrawal would be unexpected but not impossible. 2. France's Olympic performance: France has consistently been a strong performer in the Olympics. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), France finished 8th in the medal table with 33 total medals (10 gold, 12 silver, 11 bronze). 3. Home advantage: The 2024 Olympics will be held in Paris, France. Host nations often perform better than usual due to increased funding, preparation, and home crowd support. For example, in the 2012 London Olympics, Great Britain finished 3rd, a significant improvement from their 4th place finish in 2008. 4. Recent trends: In the last three Summer Olympics (2016, 2020, and 2021), the top 5 countries have consistently been the United States, China, Great Britain, Russia (or ROC in 2020), and Japan or Germany. 5. France's historical performance: France has finished in the top 5 of the medal table in several past Olympics, most recently in 1960 (5th place). 6. Increased preparation: As the host nation, France has likely been investing heavily in its Olympic program to make a strong showing at home. Given these factors, I believe France has a good chance of finishing in the top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The home advantage is particularly significant, as we've seen host nations often outperform their usual standards. France's recent 8th place finish in Tokyo shows they're already close to the top 5, and with the added boost of hosting, they could very well break into that group. The condition about Joe Biden not seeking re-election doesn't seem directly relevant to France's Olympic performance, so I'm treating that as a given for this scenario.

As of now (2023), DeSantis is considered a strong contender for the Republican nomination, but he faces significant competition, particularly from Donald Trump. Given these factors: - If Biden were to drop out, it might actually strengthen the Republican field's chances, potentially benefiting a more moderate candidate like DeSantis. - However, Trump's influence on the Republican party remains strong, and he currently leads in most polls for the Republican nomination. - The condition about France's Olympic performance is largely irrelevant to the political question at hand. The combination of these unlikely events (Biden dropping out and DeSantis securing the nomination over Trump) makes this scenario quite improbable. While DeSantis is a strong candidate, the current political landscape favors Trump for the Republican nomination. Additionally, the time between the potential Biden announcement (by July 15, 2024) and the Republican National Convention (typically held in July or August) is very short, leaving little time for a significant shift in Republican preferences.

This condition serves as a trigger for the question but doesn't influence the outcome. 2. Joe Biden's death before July 26, 2024, is the crucial element. If Biden dies before this date, he obviously cannot make any announcements after his death. 3. The question asks if Biden will announce dropping out of the re-election race and resigning from the presidency before the end of July 2024. Given these conditions, it's important to note that if Joe Biden dies before July 26, 2024, it would be impossible for him to make any announcements after his death. The question specifically asks about Biden himself making an announcement, not his staff or family members. In the event of a sitting president's death, the Vice President would immediately assume the role of President under the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. There would be no need for a formal resignation announcement from the deceased president. Furthermore, a deceased person cannot \"drop out\" of an election race. Their death would automatically remove them from the race without any formal announcement needed. Considering these factors, it is virtually impossible for Joe Biden to announce both dropping out of the re-election race and resigning from the presidency after his death, which is stipulated to occur before July 26. The only scenario where this could potentially happen is if Biden were to make such an announcement between July 21 (when the SENSEX condition is met) and the moment of his death before July 26.

Model volatility: Nate Silver's models are known for being responsive to new data, but they also aim to avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations. 6. Margin for increase: Harris only needs a small increase (any amount over 46.6%) for this to resolve as YES. This lower bar makes a YES resolution more likely. 7. Competition: The question doesn't mention other candidates, but Harris's odds are likely influenced by the performance and perception of her competitors. 8. Historical precedent: Vice Presidents often have strong showings in primary polling, but this can fluctuate. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a small increase in Harris's odds. The low threshold for a YES resolution (any increase over 46.6%) works in favor of this outcome.

The party of the French Prime Minister on July 30th, 2024: This is the main event we need to predict.

As of 2023, the current Prime Minister of France, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, belongs to the 'Together' (Ensemble) coalition. The New Popular Front is the main opposition coalition. Factors to consider: a) French politics can be volatile, and changes in government are not uncommon. b) The next French legislative election is not scheduled until 2027, but early elections are possible. c) President Emmanuel Macron's term ends in 2027, and he cannot run for a third term. d) There's growing dissatisfaction with Macron's policies, which could lead to changes in the government. However, despite these factors, there are several reasons why the Prime Minister is likely to remain from the 'Together' coalition: 1. The current government has a working majority in the National Assembly. 2. Major changes in government typically occur after elections or significant political crises. 3. The opposition, while vocal, hasn't shown the unity or strength necessary to force a change in government. Given these considerations, it seems more likely than not that the Prime Minister will still belong to the 'Together' coalition on July 30th, 2024.

Legal and constitutional processes: Even if Biden were to decide to step down, there are formal processes that need to be followed. The 25th Amendment outlines the procedure for presidential succession, which would see the Vice President (Kamala Harris) assume the presidency. This process, while not lengthy, does take some time to execute. 4. Biden's personal stance: Throughout his presidency, Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election and has not shown any inclination to step down, despite various challenges and criticisms. 5.

(a) Will Hurd being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Will Hurd is a former Republican congressman from Texas who has announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election. However, he is currently considered a long-shot candidate. As of now, former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are the clear frontrunners for the Republican nomination, with several other candidates like Nikki Haley and Tim Scott also polling ahead of Hurd. For Hurd to become the nominee, there would need to be a dramatic shift in Republican voter preferences, which seems highly improbable. The Core CPI increase of more than 0.1% in July 2024: While this part is more plausible, it's still not certain. The Federal Reserve is actively working to bring inflation down, and by July 2024, their efforts may have succeeded in stabilizing prices. However, some level of inflation is normal in a healthy economy, so a 0.1% increase is not out of the question. (b) Mayor Wilson showing at the Roswell City Council Open Forum on July 29th, 2024: This is difficult to predict with certainty as it's over a year in the future. Typically, mayors do attend city council meetings, but there could be various reasons for absence (scheduling conflicts, illness, etc.). Without more information about Mayor Wilson's attendance record or specific plans for that date, we can assume there's a reasonable chance he would attend, but it's far from certain. For this question to resolve as YES, both (a) and (b) need to occur. The probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

While Cheney's nomination could cause some Republican voters to stay home or even vote for a Democrat, it's unlikely to completely reverse the strong Republican advantage in this district.

BJP forming the government after the next Indian general election in 2024: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is currently the ruling party in India and has a strong base of support. They won decisively in the 2019 elections, and while their popularity has faced some challenges, they remain a formidable political force.

Historical ratings: Looking at the provided ratings, we can see that out of the 15 episodes with known ratings, 7 episodes (46.7%) have scored above 8.5. This gives us a baseline to work with. 2. Season 2 performance: Season 2 has been more volatile in terms of ratings compared to Season 1. We've seen both very high (9.6 for E4) and relatively low (7.6 for E5) ratings. This suggests that the quality or audience reception of episodes in Season 2 has been less consistent. 3. Recent trend: The most recent episode (E5) received a relatively low rating of 7.6, which could indicate a downward trend. However, it's important to note that ratings can fluctuate significantly from episode to episode. 4. Penultimate episode factor: E7 is likely to be the penultimate episode of the season (assuming a standard 8-episode season). Penultimate episodes in TV series often contain significant plot developments or climactic events, which can lead to higher ratings. In Season 1, the penultimate episode (E9) received an 8.7. 5. Audience expectations: As the season progresses, audience expectations may be higher, which could make it more challenging to achieve very high ratings. 6. Time for rating stabilization: The two-day period after release should allow enough time for a significant number of viewers to rate the episode, providing a relatively stable rating. Considering these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that S2E7 will be rated above 8.5 on IMDB. The historical data suggests a nearly 50/50 chance, but the volatility of Season 2 ratings and the potential for a strong penultimate episode slightly increase the likelihood.

Let's break it down: 1. Condition: Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024. 2. Outcome: Approval of the Pandemic Agreement at the May 2024 World Health Assembly. First, let's consider the likelihood of the condition being met. Given Trump's ongoing legal troubles and the active investigation in Georgia, there's a reasonable chance he could be charged with witness tampering. However, the specific timeframe (before June 1, 2024) and the nature of the charge (related to potential witnesses) make this condition somewhat uncertain. Assuming the condition is met, we need to consider the probability of the Pandemic Agreement being approved. Several factors come into play: 1. The Pandemic Agreement has been in development since 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic. There's significant global interest in improving pandemic preparedness and response. 2. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its member states have been working on drafting this agreement, aiming for adoption by 2024. 3. However, international agreements often face challenges in reaching consensus among all member states, especially on sensitive issues like national sovereignty and global health regulations. 4. The approval process requires a vote during the World Health Assembly, which adds another layer of uncertainty. 5. It's important to note that Trump's legal troubles in Georgia are likely to have minimal direct impact on the approval of the Pandemic Agreement. These are largely unrelated events. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance of the Pandemic Agreement being approved, assuming the condition is met. The global focus on pandemic preparedness and the extended preparation time increase the likelihood of approval. However, potential disagreements among member states and the complexities of international negotiations introduce some uncertainty."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "8cd519df-b040-4154-92f8-3f7c58915da3", "title": "Given both (a) Trump is charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024, and (b) the Pandemic Agreement is approved at the May 2024 WHA, will Doug Burgum be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: (a) Donald Trump is charged or indicted for any statements related to potential witnesses in *The State of Georgia v.

While there's a possibility of charges, witness tampering is a specific allegation that hasn't been prominently featured in reports about the investigation. The timeline (before June 1, 2024) adds some pressure, but it's not impossible.

Doug Burgum, the Governor of North Dakota, has very low national recognition and isn't considered a frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Current polling and political analysis suggest that candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or Nikki Haley are far more likely to secure the nomination.

Name recognition: While Elder gained some national attention during his 2021 California gubernatorial recall election campaign, his name recognition is still relatively low compared to other potential Republican candidates.

Competition: There are several high-profile Republicans who are either already running or considering running for the 2024 nomination, including Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others. These candidates have stronger national profiles and more extensive political networks. Fundraising ability: Presidential campaigns require substantial financial resources. Elder's ability to raise the necessary funds for a national campaign is uncertain and likely less than that of more established candidates. Party support: There's no indication that Elder has significant support from the Republican Party establishment or major donors, which is often crucial for securing the nomination.

Joe Biden dropping out after these events: If Harris becomes President/Acting President, Biden would have already left office, so a \"dropout\" wouldn't be applicable. This creates a logical inconsistency in the scenario. 4. Media coverage of a dropout: Major media outlets typically have good sources and often report on significant political events before official announcements. However, a presidential dropout would be highly sensitive information, potentially making early reporting riskier. 5. The 6-hour advance notice: This is a relatively short timeframe for such a major event, which could make early reporting more challenging. Given these factors, the scenario described is highly improbable. The conditions (Harris becoming President and Haley winning the nomination) are unlikely to occur simultaneously. Moreover, if Harris becomes President, Biden wouldn't be in a position to \"drop out.\" However, if we assume this unlikely scenario does unfold, and Biden is somehow still in a position to drop out, the probability of media outlets reporting it 6 hours in advance is moderately high. Major news organizations have extensive networks of sources and are competitive in breaking news. They would likely get wind of such a monumental decision and report it, even if unofficially.

Current polling: As of the question creation date (April 10, 2024), Trump has a 2.4-point lead. This suggests that Trump has some momentum, but it's not an insurmountable lead. 3. Economic factors: The state of the economy in July 2024 will likely play a significant role in voter preferences. Any major economic shifts between April and July could impact the polls. 4. Political events: Unforeseen political events, scandals, or policy announcements could sway public opinion in either direction. 5.

Polling margin: A 2-3 point lead for Trump in July is not an insurmountable deficit for Biden. National polls can fluctuate, and the race could easily tighten in the following months. 3. Biden's commitment: As an incumbent president, Biden has a strong incentive to stay in the race. He has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. 4. Party pressure: The Democratic Party would be in disarray if their nominee dropped out this late. There's no clear succession plan, and it would likely harm their chances in the election. 5. Time frame: The window between July 15 and July 20 is very short, giving little time for major decisions or party reorganization. 6. Biden's resilience: Throughout his career, Biden has shown persistence in the face of challenges. A slight polling deficit is unlikely to deter him. 7.

Given these considerations: - The conditions about US politics are set for July 2024, but the potential attack would need to happen before May 2024. This means the US political situation described wouldn't directly influence the likelihood of an attack. - Current tensions between Iran and Israel are high, with occasional conflicts and proxy wars. However, large-scale direct attacks are relatively rare due to deterrence and international pressure. - Changes in US leadership or potential leadership can influence Middle East dynamics, but this influence typically takes time to manifest in significant policy changes or regional behaviors. - The specific conditions about Trump's lead and Biden dropping out suggest a scenario of political upheaval in the US, which could potentially embolden Iran if they perceive a weakening of US support for Israel. However, this effect would likely not be immediate. - The threshold for the attack (at least five deaths) is relatively low, making it more likely to occur given the ongoing tensions.

The IOC has recommended allowing individual Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutral athletes, but this is still subject to debate and potential changes. 5.

However, it's not guaranteed as there's strong competition in team sports. I'd say this has about a 60% chance of happening. 2. Individual Neutral Athletes winning 21 or more gold medals: This is highly unlikely. 'Individual Neutral Athletes' typically refers to athletes competing under the Olympic flag due to their country being banned or suspended. In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes competed as 'ROC' (Russian Olympic Committee) due to doping sanctions and won 20 gold medals. However, this was an exceptional case. Normally, the number of neutral athletes is much smaller, and they win far fewer medals. Even if Russia competes as neutral athletes again, reaching 21 gold medals would be extremely difficult. I'd estimate this at about 5% probability. 3. USA topping the Olympic Medal Table: This is highly likely. The USA has topped the medal table in the majority of Summer Olympics they've participated in, including the last three (2012, 2016, 2020). They have a strong, well-funded Olympic program across many sports. While China is a strong competitor, the USA is still favored. I'd estimate this at about 80% probability. For the question to resolve as YES, all three of these conditions must be met. Using the multiplication rule of probability for independent events (which is a simplification, as these aren't truly independent), we get: 0.60 * 0.05 * 0.80 = 0.024 or 2.4%.

While Biden is the oldest president in US history, there's no strong indication that he's incapable of discharging his duties. The probability of this happening is very low. 2.

He remains the President, just temporarily unable to discharge his duties. 2.

If the Vice President and Cabinet disagree, Congress must decide the issue within 21 days. 5. Historical precedent: No President has ever been removed from office via the 25th Amendment. The few times it has been invoked were for planned medical procedures, and power was quickly returned to the President. 6.

Historical precedent: Venezuela has a history of imprisoning opposition leaders. For example, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez was imprisoned in 2014 and remained in custody for several years. 4. Current political climate: The Venezuelan government, led by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has been known to crack down on opposition figures, especially those who pose a significant threat to his power. 5. Machado's activities: Her continued involvement in opposition activities and her popularity among anti-government supporters make her a potential target for the government. 6. International pressure: While international pressure might deter the government from imprisoning Machado, it hasn't always been effective in similar cases in the past. 7. Upcoming elections: Venezuela is scheduled to have presidential elections in 2024. The government might see Machado as a threat and decide to imprison her to prevent her from participating or influencing the election. Given these factors, there is a significant possibility that Machado could be imprisoned before the specified date. However, it's not a certainty. The Venezuelan government might also choose other tactics to neutralize her politically without resorting to imprisonment, or international pressure might prove effective in preventing her arrest. Considering all these factors, I would estimate the probability of Maria Corina Machado being imprisoned before Friday, August 3rd, 2024, to be moderately high, but not overwhelmingly so."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "1183b804-a95f-44d3-aeea-9b8b2a34024f", "title": "Conditional on Maria Corina Machado being imprisoned before Friday, will a reliable media outlet cover Joe Biden's dropout at least 6 hours in advance?", "body": "This question explores the conditional scenario where Maria Corina Machado, the opposition leader, is imprisoned before Friday, August 3rd, 2024, at 00:00 VET.

Likelihood of Maria Corina Machado's imprisonment: Given the political situation in Venezuela and the history of opposition leaders facing persecution, there's a non-trivial chance that Machado could be imprisoned before August 3rd, 2024. However, international pressure and her prominence might also protect her to some extent. 2. Likelihood of Joe Biden dropping out: As of now (July 2024), Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee. While there have been concerns about his age and approval ratings, it's relatively rare for an incumbent to drop out. However, unforeseen health issues or major political scandals could potentially lead to this scenario. 3. Media coverage of a potential dropout: If Biden were to drop out, it would be a major political event. Given the significance, it's highly likely that major media outlets would be actively investigating and seeking confirmation from sources close to Biden or the Democratic Party. 4. Timing of the coverage: The question specifically asks about coverage at least 6 hours before the official announcement. Given the competitive nature of news media and the importance of such a story, it's plausible that a reliable outlet would publish a story based on credible sources before an official announcement. 5. Conditional nature of the question: It's important to note that this scenario only comes into play if Machado is imprisoned. This adds an extra layer of uncertainty and reduces the overall probability. Considering all these factors, while it's possible for this scenario to occur, it requires multiple unlikely events to align. The imprisonment of Machado, Biden deciding to drop out, and a media outlet breaking the story early are all individually unlikely events. When combined, the probability becomes quite low. Probability: 0.15 This low probability reflects the multiple improbable events that need to occur in sequence for this scenario to play out as described.

International response: A terrorist attack in France might lead to increased global security measures and cooperation, potentially reducing the likelihood of other conflicts. 7. Escalation factors: While a terrorist attack in France doesn't directly relate to China-Taiwan relations, it could indirectly affect global stability and potentially embolden aggressive actions. Given these factors, I believe the probability of an armed forces conflict death between China and Taiwan in 2024, conditional on a terrorist attack in France during the Olympics, is relatively low. The short timeframe (before June 6th, 2024) limits the opportunity for escalation, and the global focus on the terrorist attack might actually reduce the likelihood of other conflicts.

In the 2016 Rio Olympics, 27 world records were broken. 2. Impact of terrorist act: A terrorist act in metropolitan France during the Olympics could have a significant negative impact on the Games. It might lead to increased security measures, potential cancellation or postponement of events, and a general atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. This could potentially hinder athletes' performances and reduce the likelihood of breaking world records. 3. Impact of China-Taiwan conflict: An armed conflict between China and Taiwan before the Olympics could lead to geopolitical tensions and potentially affect the participation of athletes from these countries or their allies. This might reduce the overall pool of top athletes competing, potentially decreasing the chances of world records being broken. 4. Technological advancements: Despite the negative factors, ongoing improvements in training methods, equipment, and sports science could still contribute to record-breaking performances. 5. Athlete preparation: The hypothetical events occur relatively close to the Olympics, meaning many athletes would have already completed most of their preparation. Some might be extra motivated to perform well as a show of resilience in the face of global challenges. 6. Olympic spirit: Historically, the Olympic Games have sometimes served as a unifying event in times of global tension. Athletes might be inspired to perform at their absolute best as a demonstration of human achievement and global unity. Given these factors, I believe that while the terrorist act and China-Taiwan conflict would have a negative impact on the Games and potentially reduce the number of world records broken, it's not impossible for 24 or more world records to be broken.

President Joe Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election, and as the incumbent, he has a strong advantage.

In the 2019 elections, they held 74 out of 751 seats (9.85%). To hold the most seats, they would need to more than double their representation and surpass the EPP, which held 182 seats (24.23%) in 2019.

The Venezuelan government has been known to use legal maneuvers to sideline opposition figures, but outright imprisonment of such a high-profile figure might face international backlash.

Historical trends: Over the past few decades, the USD/JPY rate has fluctuated significantly. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was above 145, but it has generally been lower since then. 3. Economic factors: a) Interest rate differentials: The Fed has been raising rates, while the Bank of Japan maintains ultra-low rates.

Currency fluctuation: The condition of USD being worth >= 145 JPY is a significant currency movement. As of 2023, the exchange rate is around 130-140 JPY per USD. A rate of 145 or higher would indicate a strong dollar and potentially weak yen, which could have global economic implications. 2. Connection between currency and Secret Service: There's no direct connection between the USD/JPY exchange rate and the leadership of the Secret Service. The Secret Service is primarily responsible for protecting national leaders and investigating financial crimes, not managing currency rates. 3. Tenure of Secret Service Directors: Kimberly Cheatle became the Director of the Secret Service in September 2022. Secret Service Directors typically serve for several years, often spanning different administrations. There's no standard term length, and directors usually don't resign without significant cause. 4. Political climate: By August 2024, the U.S. will be in the midst of a presidential election campaign. This could potentially lead to changes in leadership positions, but the Secret Service Director is generally considered a non-partisan position. 5. Performance and controversies: As of now (2023), there are no major controversies or performance issues associated with Kimberly Cheatle that would suggest an impending resignation or firing. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a 90-day period, which is a relatively short time for such a significant leadership change without a pre-existing reason. Given these factors, there doesn't seem to be a strong connection between the currency condition and the potential resignation of the Secret Service Director.

While possible, this would represent a substantial weakening of the yen or strengthening of the dollar. 2. Kimberly Cheatle's position: The condition of her no longer being the director of the Secret Service before October 12, 2024, is plausible given the typical turnover in such positions, especially around election cycles. 3. Donald Trump's nomination: This is the core question, assuming the above conditions are met. Factors supporting Trump's nomination: - Trump remains highly popular among Republican voters. - He has a strong base of supporters and significant influence within the party. - He has already announced his candidacy for 2024. - Historical precedent favors former presidents seeking renomination. Factors against Trump's nomination: - Legal challenges and investigations he faces could impact his candidacy. - Potential fatigue among some Republicans for a new direction. - Emergence of strong alternative candidates (e.g., Ron DeSantis). - Concerns about his electability in a general election. Given the conditions are met (currency exchange and Secret Service director change), these events could potentially be indicative of economic or political instability, which might favor a candidate perceived as a 'strong leader' like Trump. However, it's important to note that these conditions, while potentially correlated, do not directly cause Trump's nomination.

This suggests that either Christie has managed to maintain strong Republican support, or Biden's popularity has significantly decreased. e) Given that Trump has a lead despite not being the nominee, it's more likely that Biden's popularity has decreased rather than Christie being exceptionally popular. f) In this scenario, with Biden's popularity low and Christie as the nominee, it's plausible that the Republican lead could be on the higher end of the given range. g) However, the question asks for a very specific range (3 to 4 points), which is only half of the already narrow range given in the condition.

Legal precedent: There have been attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates, but they have rarely been successful. The most notable recent case was the attempt to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene from the ballot in Georgia, which failed. 2. Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in multiple states to remove Trump from the ballot using the 14th Amendment argument, particularly citing his role in the January 6th Capitol riot. 3. State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently, potentially leading to varied outcomes across the country. 4. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the 2024 presidential election. This gives ample time for legal challenges to be filed and processed through the court system. 5. Political climate: The polarized nature of American politics may influence how aggressively these challenges are pursued and how they are received by the public and the courts. 6. Supreme Court involvement: Given the high-profile nature of such a case, it's likely that any successful removal attempt would be appealed to the Supreme Court, which could potentially rule on the matter before the resolution date. 7. Trump's actions: Any further actions by Trump that could be construed as supporting or inciting insurrection could strengthen the case for his removal under the 14th Amendment. While there are serious efforts to remove Trump from ballots using the 14th Amendment, the legal hurdles are significant. Courts have historically been reluctant to interfere with ballot access, especially for major party candidates. Additionally, the Supreme Court, with its current conservative majority, might be skeptical of such challenges. However, given the unprecedented nature of the January 6th events and Trump's role in them, there is a non-trivial chance that at least one state might succeed in removing him from the ballot.

Let's break it down: 1. Donald Trump is removed from at least one state's primary election ballot by July 15, 2024, under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. 2. The BJP forms the government in India after the next general election. 3. Given these conditions, we need to determine if a Trump family member will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential election. First, let's consider the impact of Trump's removal from a primary ballot: - This would be a significant blow to Donald Trump's campaign, potentially damaging his chances of securing the nomination. - However, it's important to note that this removal is only confirmed for one state, which may not be enough to completely derail his campaign if he performs well in other states. - The removal might actually galvanize his supporters, viewing it as political persecution, which could strengthen his position in other states. Next, let's consider the other Trump family members: - None of the other Trump family members have significant political experience or have expressed serious interest in running for president. - However, if Donald Trump is unable to secure the nomination due to legal issues, there's a possibility that he might endorse one of his children (likely Donald Jr. or Ivanka) to carry on his political legacy. The BJP forming the government in India doesn't seem directly relevant to this question, so we can set that condition aside. Given these factors, I believe there's still a significant chance that a Trump family member could be the Republican nominee: 1. Donald Trump remains popular among Republican voters and could potentially overcome the ballot removal in one state. 2. If Donald Trump is unable to run, there's a possibility that another family member could step in with his endorsement and inherit much of his support base. 3. The Republican Party has become closely aligned with Trump's brand of politics, which could favor a Trump family member even if Donald himself is not the nominee. However, there are also factors that reduce this probability: 1. The ballot removal could be a sign of more legal troubles to come, which might tarnish the Trump brand. 2. Other strong Republican candidates might emerge and gain support if Trump's campaign is weakened. 3. The party might decide to distance itself from the Trump family if they believe it will hurt their chances in the general election. Considering all these factors, I believe there's still a good chance of a Trump family member being the nominee, but it's far from certain."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "1f734cfe-7290-4636-8b70-fa0d44465d4c", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, and the BJP forms the government after the next Indian general election in 2024, and (2) a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if all of the following conditions are met: (1) On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

The requirement for verification by Metaculus and satisfaction of righttowarn.ai members adds another layer of complexity. Probability: ~20%. (b) Joe Biden announces resignation and withdrawal before end of July 2024: This is extremely unlikely. Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election.

(c) Iran initiates military action on Israeli territory before August 13, 2024: While tensions between Iran and Israel are high, direct military action by Iran on Israeli territory is relatively rare.

Current number of traders: The question states that 78 more traders are needed to reach 377. This implies that the market currently has 299 traders (377 - 78 = 299). 3. Growth rate: Without specific information about the market's growth rate, we can assume it has attracted 299 traders in about 8 months (from August 2023 to April 2024, assuming the question was asked recently). This averages to about 37-38 traders per month. 4. Remaining time: There are approximately 3 months left until the resolution date. At the current average growth rate, the market could attract about 111-114 more traders (37-38 * 3). 5. Market dynamics: As markets gain more traders, they often become more visible and attractive to new participants. This could lead to accelerated growth in the final months. 6. Potential challenges: The market might face saturation or decreased interest over time, which could slow down growth. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that the market will reach 377 traders by July 15. The current growth rate suggests it could easily surpass this number, and there's a good amount of time left.

Historical precedent: The 25th Amendment Section 4 has never been invoked in U.S. history. It's an extremely rare and serious measure that would only be used in dire circumstances. 3. Biden's health: While Biden is the oldest serving president, his doctors have consistently reported that he is in good health for his age. There are no known severe health issues that would warrant such a drastic measure. 4. Political implications: Invoking the 25th Amendment would be an enormous political decision with far-reaching consequences. It would likely only be done if there was an acute, severe, and obvious incapacitation. 5. Time frame: The question asks about this happening before August 2024, which is less than a year away. This is a relatively short time frame for such a significant event to occur without any current indications. 6.

Joe Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment before August 2024: This is a very low probability event. While Biden is older, he has not shown signs of severe incapacitation that would warrant invoking the 25th Amendment. Such an action would be extremely rare and politically fraught. Let's estimate this at 1% probability. 3. Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024: Trump is currently facing legal challenges in Georgia related to election interference. Witness tampering charges are possible, given past allegations and ongoing investigations. However, the legal process can be slow, and it's not certain that such charges would be brought, or brought before June 1, 2024. Let's estimate this at 30% probability.

Will Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024? This is a highly unlikely event. While Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history and there have been concerns about his age and health, invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment is an extreme measure that has never been used in U.S. history. It would require a majority of Biden's own Cabinet to turn against him, which is very improbable barring a severe and sudden health crisis. 3. Will Donald Trump be charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024? While Trump is facing legal challenges in Georgia, a specific charge of witness tampering is not certain. However, given the ongoing investigations and Trump's history of making potentially problematic statements, this is more plausible than the Biden scenario. For all three of these events to occur together, we would need the most likely event (the market reaching 377 traders) to happen along with two less likely events.

For it to reach 76,000-77,000 by July 2024, it would require significant growth. While possible, this is a fairly specific range that adds uncertainty to the scenario. 2.

This condition adds another layer of uncertainty. 3. Trump's lead over Biden between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024: This is a very specific range in a hypothetical match-up between Trump and Biden, assuming both are running. Several factors make this scenario less likely: a) If DeSantis is the nominee, Trump wouldn't be in the race, making this condition impossible. b) It's not certain that Biden will run for re-election. c) A 2-4 point lead is a narrow range, and polls can be volatile. d) The specific date (July 15, 2024) adds another constraint. Given these factors, the probability of this exact scenario occurring is quite low.

Let's break them down: 1. BSE SENSEX closing between 76k and 77k on July 21, 2024: The BSE SENSEX is currently trading around 66,000 (as of 2023). Predicting a specific range for a stock index more than a year in advance is extremely difficult due to market volatility and numerous influencing factors. While the overall trend of the Indian market has been bullish, reaching 76k-77k would require a significant increase of about 15-17% from current levels. This is possible but not highly probable. 2. Ron DeSantis being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of now (2023), Donald Trump is leading in most Republican primary polls, with DeSantis typically in second place. While DeSantis has strong support, overtaking Trump's lead among Republican voters seems challenging. Additionally, other candidates may emerge or gain traction. DeSantis winning the nomination is possible but not highly likely. 3. Trump's lead over Biden being between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average: This is a very specific prediction for a date more than a year away.

Carlson's lack of political experience: While Carlson is well-known in conservative circles, he has no experience in elected office or government administration, which could be a significant drawback for many Republican voters and party officials. 4. Time constraints: The scenario assumes these events occur before July 15, 2024, which leaves little time for Carlson to build a campaign infrastructure and gain widespread support before the Republican National Convention. 5. Impact of given conditions: While the resignation of the Secret Service head and Biden's withdrawal could create political turmoil, it's not clear how these events would directly benefit Carlson over other Republican candidates. 6. Party establishment preferences: The Republican Party establishment might prefer a candidate with more traditional political credentials and experience. 7. Carlson's controversial nature: His provocative statements and positions might make him a risky choice for the party in a general election. 8. Potential for a surprise nomination: In times of political upheaval, unconventional candidates can sometimes gain traction quickly. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Tucker Carlson to become the Republican nominee under these circumstances, it seems highly unlikely. The established candidates with political experience and existing campaign structures would have a significant advantage. Carlson's lack of political experience and the short timeframe would make it very difficult for him to overcome these obstacles."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "fb5ef560-42ad-4a89-813d-e0bc78734889", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) the head of the Secret Service resigns within the next 90 days, (b) Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President, and (c) Tucker Carlson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "(a) Will Kimberly Cheatle, the Director of the U.S. Secret Service, resign, be fired, or for any other reason no longer be the director of the Secret Service before October 12, 2024?\n\n(b) Will Joe Biden or his campaign make a definitive, public, official announcement before 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle?

(b) Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024: As of now, Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. While there are concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, he remains the presumptive Democratic nominee. It would be highly unusual for a sitting president to decline their party's nomination, especially this late in the process. The probability of this happening is very low, perhaps 0.02 or 2%.

While he has a significant following as a conservative commentator, he has not shown any serious intention to run for president.

Competition: While other countries have improved in basketball, the U.S. still maintains a significant advantage. However, teams like Spain, Australia, and Serbia for men, and Australia, Spain, and Japan for women have shown they can be competitive. 4.

The men's team has occasionally faltered, such as in 2004 when they won bronze. 7. Time until the event: The Olympics are still about 9 months away, which leaves room for changes in team composition or unexpected developments.

USA winning gold in both Men's and Women's 5v5 basketball at the Paris Olympics: The USA has historically dominated Olympic basketball, especially in the women's category. The men's team has faced more competition recently but remains a strong favorite. Given their track record and the depth of talent, there's a high probability of around 80-85% for both teams winning gold. 2. Miami Heat winning the 2024 NBA Finals: This is the most uncertain component. The Heat reached the NBA Finals in 2023 but lost. While they're a strong team, winning the NBA championship depends on many factors including injuries, trades, and performance of other teams. Their chances are not insignificant, but also not high. I'd estimate around 10-15% chance for this. 3. Olympic record for men's pole vault being broken: The current record is 6.03m, set by Thiago Braz in 2016. While records are broken periodically, it's not a given in any particular Olympics. However, with advancing technology and training methods, there's a decent chance.

Recent tensions: The Middle East has seen increased tensions, particularly with conflicts involving Israel and Iranian-backed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. 3. Iran's capabilities: Iran has demonstrated its ability to conduct or sponsor attacks in the region, including through proxies. 4. Israel's defense capabilities: Israel has a robust defense system and intelligence network, which makes it challenging for Iran to carry out direct attacks on Israeli soil. 5. International pressure: The international community, particularly the United States, has been working to prevent escalation between Iran and Israel. 6. Time frame: The question spans about three years from the creation date, which is a significant period during which geopolitical situations can change dramatically. 7. Threshold for resolution: The attack needs to result in at least five deaths, which is a relatively high bar for a single attack. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability of such an attack occurring. The long-standing tensions and Iran's capabilities suggest a real possibility, but Israel's strong defenses and international efforts to prevent escalation serve as significant deterrents.

Such an event would likely cause significant geopolitical tensions and could impact global markets, including India's. 2. Time frame: There's a considerable gap between the potential attack (before May 1, 2024) and the date for assessing the BSE SENSEX (July 21, 2024). This allows time for markets to potentially stabilize after initial shocks. 3. BSE SENSEX target range: The question asks if the SENSEX will close between 75,000 and 76,000 on July 21, 2024. This is a very narrow range, making it less likely to occur. 4. Current SENSEX level: As of May 2023, the BSE SENSEX is around 62,000. Reaching 75,000-76,000 by July 2024 would require significant growth. 5. Indian economy: India's economy has been growing steadily, and the stock market has shown long-term upward trends. However, geopolitical events and global economic factors can cause volatility. 6. Market reactions: An Iran-Israel conflict could lead to oil price spikes, which might negatively impact India's economy as it's a major oil importer. However, the impact might be mitigated by July 2024.

Growth potential: Nvidia has been experiencing rapid growth due to its dominance in AI chips and GPUs. The AI boom has significantly boosted Nvidia's stock price and market cap in recent months. 3.

Nvidia vs. Apple market cap: The first condition is that Nvidia's market capitalization needs to be larger than Apple's on June 28, 2024. This is a significant shift from the current market situation where Apple's market cap is substantially larger than Nvidia's. While Nvidia has been growing rapidly due to AI advancements, overtaking Apple would require a major market shift. This condition adds uncertainty to the question. 2. Trump vs. Biden polling: The main question revolves around Trump's lead over Biden in the 538 national polling average on July 15, 2024. Specifically, we're looking for a lead greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points. 3. Current political landscape: As of now (2023), the 2024 presidential race is still quite far away, and polls can change significantly. However, recent polls have shown a close race between Trump and Biden, with some polls giving Trump a slight lead. 4. Historical polling data: Historically, presidential races tend to tighten as the election approaches. A 3-4 point lead is significant but not uncommon in presidential polling. 5. Time frame: The poll we're interested in is from July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the election (November 2024). By this time, both party conventions would likely have concluded, and the race would be in full swing. 6. Potential events: Many events could occur between now and July 2024 that could significantly impact the polls, including economic changes, international events, scandals, or policy announcements. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of this scenario occurring. The Nvidia market cap condition adds uncertainty, but if that condition is met, it might indicate a strong tech market and potentially a strong economy, which could benefit the incumbent party (Democrats). However, other factors like voter fatigue with Biden's age or dissatisfaction with his policies could push polls in Trump's favor. A 3-4 point lead for Trump is plausible but not certain. It's a narrow range that requires the race to be close but with Trump having a clear advantage.

This is unusual as UK general elections are typically held on Thursdays, and July 4 is a Thursday in 2024. However, it's not impossible for an election to be held on this date. 3. Nigel Farage's political status: As of 2023, Farage is not a member of any major UK political party. He left the Brexit Party (now Reform UK) in 2021. For him to be elected as an MP, he would need to either rejoin a party or run as an independent. 4. UK political landscape: The UK uses a first-past-the-post voting system, which makes it difficult for candidates outside the major parties to win seats. Farage has unsuccessfully run for parliament seven times in the past. 5. Time frame: The question is created about a month before the hypothetical election. This gives little time for significant changes in Farage's political position. 6. Public opinion: Farage is a polarizing figure in UK politics. While he has a dedicated base of supporters, he also faces significant opposition from many voters. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Farage would be elected as an MP: - He is not currently associated with a major party, reducing his chances in the first-past-the-post system. - His past attempts to become an MP have all failed. - The short time frame between the question's creation and the election date leaves little room for a dramatic shift in his political prospects. - The unusual election date (July 4) might suggest some extraordinary circumstances, but there's no information to indicate how this would affect Farage's chances. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility. Farage has a high public profile and could potentially capitalize on political upheaval or dissatisfaction with mainstream parties.

Incumbent advantage: Historically, incumbent presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless faced with significant challenges or health issues. 2. Biden's age and health: At 80 years old, Biden is already the oldest serving president. By the 2024 election, he would be 82, which raises concerns about his ability to serve another full term. 3. Current statements and actions: Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has been building his campaign infrastructure. 4.

Luxembourg's participation in Eurovision: Luxembourg hasn't participated in Eurovision since 1993. They withdrew from the contest due to financial reasons and have not shown any strong interest in returning in recent years. This long absence significantly reduces the likelihood of their participation in 2024. 2. Recent developments: As of now, there have been no official announcements or strong indications from Luxembourg about returning to Eurovision in 2024. Usually, countries announce their intentions to participate or return to the contest well in advance. 3. Eurovision rules: For a country to qualify for the Grand Final, they must first participate in one of the Semi-finals (unless they are part of the \"Big Five\" or the host country). Given Luxembourg's long absence, if they were to return, they would need to compete in a Semi-final. 4. Conditional nature of the question: The question is conditional on Latvia qualifying for the Grand Final and the linked market reaching 377 traders. While these conditions add complexity, they don't directly impact Luxembourg's potential participation or qualification. 5. Historical performance: If Luxembourg were to return and participate, their historical performance (5 wins and several top 5 finishes) suggests they could potentially do well. However, the Eurovision landscape has changed significantly since their last participation, making it difficult to predict their performance based on past results. 6. Time frame: The resolution date is in July 2024, which is after the typical Eurovision season (usually held in May).

He has focused on his role as governor and has not made significant moves towards a presidential campaign. 4. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still over a year away. While this gives Youngkin time to potentially build a campaign, it also means the field is likely to change significantly before the nomination. 5. Political climate: The Republican party is currently divided between traditional conservatives and Trump-aligned populists. Youngkin's moderate stance might appeal to some, but could also limit his support from more conservative factions. 6. Fundraising and organization: To become a serious contender, Youngkin would need to quickly build a national fundraising and campaign organization, which he currently lacks compared to other candidates. 7. Name recognition: While Youngkin has gained some national attention, his name recognition is still relatively low compared to other potential nominees. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Glenn Youngkin will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Glenn Youngkin becoming the Republican nominee: Currently, Youngkin is not a frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are leading in polls. However, Youngkin has been gaining attention and could potentially emerge as a compromise candidate. The probability of this happening is relatively low, perhaps around 10-15%. 2. Anthropic publishing a red-teaming report: Anthropic is known for its focus on AI safety, and red-teaming is a common practice in the AI industry. It's quite plausible that they would publish such a report by June 2024. I'd estimate the probability of this at around 70-80%. 3. Joe Biden not accepting the Democratic nomination: This is the most crucial and uncertain part of the scenario. As of now (June 2023), Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election and is the presumptive Democratic nominee. For him to reverse this decision would be a major shift. Some factors to consider: a) Biden's age and health: He will be 81 in 2024, and concerns about his age could intensify. b) Political landscape: If his approval ratings drop significantly or if there's a strong push within the Democratic party for a new candidate, he might reconsider. c) Personal factors: Unforeseen personal or family issues could arise. However, it's important to note that incumbent presidents rarely decline to seek re-election, and Biden has given no indication that he's considering stepping aside. The connection between Youngkin's nomination, Anthropic's report, and Biden's decision is not clear or direct. While Youngkin might be seen as a potentially strong challenger, it's unlikely that his nomination alone would cause Biden to step aside. Similarly, an AI safety report from Anthropic, while important in the tech world, is unlikely to have a direct impact on Biden's political decisions. Given all these factors, the probability of Biden announcing he won't accept the nomination by July 15, 2024, even if both preconditions are met, is quite low. I would estimate it at around 5-10%.

Name recognition: While Elder gained some national attention during his run for California governor in the 2021 recall election, his name recognition is still relatively low compared to other potential Republican candidates. 3. Political experience: Elder has never held elected office, which could be seen as a disadvantage compared to other potential candidates with more extensive political experience. 4. Competition: There are several high-profile Republicans who are either already running or considering running for the nomination, including Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others. These candidates have stronger national profiles and more established support bases. 5. Fundraising ability: Elder would likely face significant challenges in raising the necessary funds to mount a competitive national campaign, especially against well-funded opponents. 6. Party support: There's no indication that Elder has significant support from the Republican Party establishment or major donors, which would be crucial for securing the nomination. 7. Policy positions: While Elder's conservative views align with much of the Republican base, he doesn't have a unique policy platform that sets him apart from other potential candidates. 8. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still more than a year away, which theoretically gives Elder time to build a campaign and gain support.

The connection between US and UK politics: While there can be some influence of US politics on global trends, the direct impact of a US presidential nominee on a UK general election is typically limited. The UK electorate is more likely to focus on domestic issues and their own political landscape. 3. Rishi Sunak's current position and prospects: Rishi Sunak is the current Prime Minister of the UK and leader of the Conservative Party. As an incumbent, he has certain advantages in terms of name recognition and party support. However, his party has been facing challenges in public opinion polls. 4. UK electoral system: In the UK's first-past-the-post system, Sunak only needs to win his own constituency to be elected as an MP. He doesn't need to win a national popular vote to retain his seat in Parliament. 5. Sunak's constituency: Sunak represents Richmond (Yorks), a traditionally safe Conservative seat. He won this seat with a substantial majority in the 2019 election. 6. Current UK political climate: While the Conservative Party has been struggling in national polls, this doesn't necessarily translate to Sunak losing his own seat. Local factors and personal popularity can play a significant role. 7. Timing of events: The US Republican nominee would be chosen after the UK general election, so there's no direct causal link possible. Considering these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Larry Elder's hypothetical nomination would have any significant impact on Rishi Sunak's chances of being elected as an MP. Even if the Conservative Party performs poorly overall, Sunak is likely to retain his seat due to the nature of his constituency and his personal profile.

While he has a following among conservatives, he is not considered a frontrunner for the Republican nomination. If he were to become the nominee, it might be seen as a weaker opposition to Biden, potentially encouraging Biden to stay in the race. 3. Rishi Sunak's potential loss: Sunak's performance in the UK election is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Biden's decision-making process for the US election. 4. Biden's age and health: Biden would be 82 at the start of a second term, which has raised concerns about his ability to serve effectively. However, he has maintained that he is fit for office. 5. Democratic Party dynamics: There is no clear successor to Biden within the Democratic Party, which may pressure him to run again to avoid a potentially divisive primary process. 6. Timing: The question specifies an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively late in the election cycle. Most candidates typically announce their intentions much earlier. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Biden would suddenly announce he won't seek the nomination, especially so late in the process and against a potentially weaker opponent like Larry Elder. The hypothetical scenario with Rishi Sunak doesn't appear to have a significant bearing on Biden's decision.

Manifold respondents vs. general public: The question asks if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. While we don't have specific information about Manifold's user base, we can assume that they might be more politically engaged or informed than the average voter. 3. Time frame: The polls close on July 6, 2024, which is relatively close to the 2024 US presidential election.

Threshold: The question requires Trump to gain at least 3% more votes when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat.

This could work for or against him, depending on his performance and public perception. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Trump will gain at least 3% more votes against Biden compared to a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. The reasons are: a) The consistent polling showing Biden performing worse than other Democrats against Trump suggests a real weakness for Biden as a candidate. b) Politically engaged respondents (as Manifold users likely are) may be more aware of Biden's strengths and weaknesses compared to a hypothetical generic Democrat. c) The 3% threshold, while significant, is not unreasonably high given the polling differences mentioned. d) By July 2024, Biden's record as president will be fully established, potentially amplifying any perceived weaknesses.

The hypothetical scenario: The question assumes that Trump gains at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat. This suggests that Trump's support might be stronger when directly compared to Biden, which could potentially embolden him or his supporters. 2. Ongoing legal issues in Georgia: Trump is already facing legal scrutiny in Georgia related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. The Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, has been conducting a criminal investigation into these matters. 3. Witness tampering allegations: There have been previous instances where Trump has been accused of witness tampering or intimidation, such as his social media posts about potential witnesses in other investigations. 4. Timeline: The question asks about charges before June 1, 2024, which gives almost a year for potential charges to be filed. 5. Legal process: Charging someone with witness tampering requires substantial evidence and a careful legal process, especially when dealing with a high-profile figure like a former president. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance that Trump could be charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024. The ongoing investigation in Georgia and Trump's history of making potentially intimidating statements about witnesses increase the likelihood. However, the legal bar for proving witness tampering is high, and prosecutors would need to be very confident in their case before bringing such charges against a former president. The hypothetical scenario of Trump gaining support when compared directly to Biden doesn't directly impact the likelihood of witness tampering charges, but it could potentially influence Trump's behavior or the urgency with which prosecutors might act.

Given the rapid pace of AI development, this is a considerable amount of time for further advancements. 3. AI progress: The field of AI is advancing rapidly, with new models and capabilities being introduced frequently. It's reasonable to expect continued progress over the next year. 4. Public perception: As AI capabilities become more apparent and integrated into daily life, public perception of what constitutes 'weak AGI' may shift, potentially leading more people to believe it has been achieved. 5. Conservative estimate: The question asks for 'at least 30%', which is only a slight increase from the 27% in June 2023. Given the trend and the time frame, this seems like a conservative target. 6. Manifold community: The respondents are likely to be well-informed about AI progress, which could lead to a higher percentage of 'Yes' responses compared to the general public. 7. Lack of specific definition: The poll intentionally doesn't define 'weak AGI,' allowing respondents to use their own understanding. This flexibility could lead to a higher percentage of 'Yes' responses as people apply their own criteria. Considering these factors, especially the current trend, the long time frame for further development, and the relatively low threshold of 30%, it seems quite likely that this threshold will be met or exceeded by July 2024."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "91db641d-7cc9-4d71-94d0-423f620ab748", "title": "Given at least 30% of Manifold respondents agree that weak AGI was achieved before July 23, 2024, will GUE/NGL hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: At least 30% of Manifold respondents agree that weak AGI has been achieved before July 23, 2024.

However, the question only requires 30% of Manifold respondents to agree that it has been achieved, which is a lower bar than actual achievement. 2. The current political landscape in the European Union: GUE/NGL (European United Left/Nordic Green Left) is currently one of the smaller groups in the European Parliament. In the 2019 elections, they won 39 out of 751 seats, which is far from being the largest group. 3. Trends in European politics: While there has been a rise in left-wing and progressive movements in some European countries, this hasn't translated to widespread dominance of far-left parties across the EU. 4. The impact of potential weak AGI achievement on voting patterns: If there's a perception that weak AGI has been achieved, it could potentially influence voting behavior. However, it's unclear whether this would significantly benefit GUE/NGL over other political groups. 5. The structure of the European Parliament: The parliament is designed to represent a wide range of political views across member states, making it difficult for any single group to gain a dominant position. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that GUE/NGL would hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections, even if there's a perception that weak AGI has been achieved. The group would need to make unprecedented gains across multiple countries to overcome the current leading groups like the European People's Party (EPP) or the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). While the potential achievement of weak AGI could influence political discourse, it's unlikely to cause such a dramatic shift in voting patterns across the EU in favor of GUE/NGL.

Nature of political announcements: Major political decisions, especially those involving the presidency, are often leaked or hinted at before official announcements. This is partly due to the number of people involved in such decisions and the media's constant pursuit of breaking news. 4. Time frame: The 6-hour advance notice is a relatively short period in political news cycles, making it more likely for news to break within this timeframe if a dropout were to occur. 5. Media competition: Given the high-stakes nature of such news, there would be intense competition among media outlets to break the story first, increasing the likelihood of early reporting. 6.

This provides multiple opportunities for athletes to compete and potentially win medals. 2. Historical precedent: In recent Olympics, it has been common for top players to win multiple medals. For example: - At Tokyo 2020, Andrey Rublev and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova won gold in mixed doubles and silver/bronze in their respective singles events. - At Rio 2016, Andy Murray won gold in singles and silver in mixed doubles. - At London 2012, Andy Murray won gold in singles and silver in mixed doubles, while Serena Williams won gold in both singles and doubles. 3. Top players often compete in multiple events: Many top-ranked players participate in both singles and doubles (or mixed doubles) events, increasing their chances of winning multiple medals. 4. Skill level and dominance: Tennis has several dominant players who consistently perform well in major tournaments. These players are likely to be strong contenders for multiple medals. 5. Team strength: Some countries have strong tennis teams, which increases the likelihood of their players winning medals in multiple events, especially in doubles. 6. Short timeframe: The question is asked close to the event (about 2 weeks before), which means we have a good idea of the participating athletes and their current form. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that at least one athlete will win more than one medal in tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The historical precedent shows that this has happened in recent Olympics, and the structure of the tennis events (with five different competitions) provides ample opportunity for top players to achieve this. However, we must also consider potential challenges: - Injuries or unexpected upsets could prevent top players from winning multiple medals. - The competition level at the Olympics is extremely high, making it difficult to win multiple events. - Some top players might choose to focus on just one event to maximize their chances.

The condition of many world records being broken could potentially favor the USA, as they have strong athletes in many disciplines. However, the margin between gold and silver medals can be small, and recent performance (Tokyo 2020) shows it's not guaranteed.

The probability of this happening is moderately high, perhaps around 60-70%. 2. At least 24 world records are broken: This is a high bar.

Historical performance: The BSE SENSEX has shown significant growth over the past decades. In the last 5 years, it has grown from around 35,000 to 62,000, which is about a 77% increase or roughly 12% annual growth. 3. Economic factors: India's economy is one of the fastest-growing major economies globally. The country's GDP growth, increasing foreign investments, and government initiatives to boost the economy could positively impact the stock market. 4.

Given these factors, reaching the 75,000 to 77,000 range by July 2024 is possible but not highly probable. The index would need to maintain a strong growth trajectory, which is feasible given India's economic outlook.

Let's break it down: 1. BSE SENSEX condition: The question is conditional on the BSE SENSEX closing between 75,000 and 77,000 on July 21, 2024. This is a significant increase from its current level (around 66,000 as of May 2023). While such growth is possible over a year, it would require substantial economic growth and investor confidence in India. 2. Iran-Israel tensions: The relationship between Iran and Israel has been historically tense, with occasional threats and proxy conflicts. However, direct military action by Iran against Israel is relatively rare due to the potential for severe international consequences. 3. Timeframe: The window for military action is narrow (July 30 to August 12, 2024), which reduces the likelihood of an event occurring within this specific period. 4. International context: By 2024, the global political landscape may have changed significantly, potentially affecting Iran's willingness to engage in direct military action. 5. Definition of military action: The question specifies that only direct actions by Iran, not proxy attacks, would count. This narrows the scope of potential 'Yes' resolutions. 6. Historical precedent: Iran has generally avoided direct military confrontations with Israel, preferring to support proxy groups or engage in covert operations. 7. Deterrence: Israel's military capabilities and potential international support serve as a significant deterrent to direct Iranian military action. Given these factors, the probability of Iran initiating a military response against Israel within the specified timeframe seems low. The conditional nature of the question (dependent on the BSE SENSEX) adds an additional layer of uncertainty.

The BSE SENSEX is currently around 65,000 (as of August 2023), so reaching 76,000-77,000 by July 2024 would require significant growth. While possible, it's not guaranteed. 2. Biden being favored by 538 on July 19, 2024: Political landscapes can change rapidly, but Biden is the incumbent president, which often provides an advantage. However, his approval ratings and other factors will play a role. This condition is plausible but not certain. 3. Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024: This is the key event we're assessing, and it needs to happen before the other conditions are even evaluated. As of August 2023, Trump has been indicted in Georgia on racketeering and conspiracy charges related to attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. While witness tampering isn't explicitly mentioned in the current charges, it's not uncommon for additional charges to be added as investigations progress. Factors to consider: - Trump is already facing multiple legal challenges, including charges related to the 2020 election in Georgia. - The investigation in Georgia has been ongoing and thorough. - Witness tampering is a serious charge that prosecutors would likely pursue if evidence emerges. - The timeline (before June 1, 2024) gives nearly a year for potential new evidence or charges to surface. However: - Trump's legal team will likely work hard to prevent additional charges. - The political sensitivity of the case might make prosecutors cautious about adding charges without overwhelming evidence.

Impact of such charges on the Democratic party and Biden's candidacy: - New charges against Trump might actually strengthen Biden's position as the Democratic candidate, as it could be seen as vindication of his stance against Trump. - Democrats are generally united in their opposition to Trump, so new charges are unlikely to cause a significant shift in party dynamics. 3. Likelihood of 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out: - This would be an extraordinary and unprecedented move within the party. - Biden is the incumbent president, and the party typically rallies behind incumbents. - There are currently no significant calls within the Democratic party for Biden to step aside. - Even if concerns about Biden's age or electability persist, a mass call for him to drop out is highly unlikely, especially in response to Trump's legal troubles. 4.

Regarding France placing in the Top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics, France has a strong Olympic tradition and has consistently performed well in recent Olympics. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), France finished 8th in the medal table with 33 total medals (10 gold, 12 silver, 11 bronze).

However, the question asks for the probability of France placing in the Top 5 conditional on the Knicks winning the NBA Finals.

Economic factors: a) Interest rate differentials: The Federal Reserve has been raising rates aggressively, while the Bank of Japan maintains ultra-low rates. This supports a stronger USD. b) Inflation: Higher inflation in the US could lead to more rate hikes, strengthening the USD. c) Economic growth: If the US economy outperforms Japan's, it could lead to a stronger USD. 4.

USD/JPY exchange rate: As of May 2023, the USD/JPY rate is around 135. Predicting the exact exchange rate over a year in advance is challenging due to various economic factors. However, the yen has been weakening against the dollar in recent years. A rate of 145 or higher is possible but not certain. 2. Trump's lead over Biden: As of May 2023, the 2024 presidential race is still in its early stages. Trump hasn't officially secured the Republican nomination yet, though he's the frontrunner. Biden is the incumbent but faces challenges. Polls this far out are not highly predictive of the final outcome. The question asks for a very specific polling lead (3-4 points) on a specific date (July 15, 2024). This narrow range makes it less likely to occur. 3.

The conditions: The question is conditional on two future events occurring in July and August 2024. These conditions are not directly related to the diplomatic situation between the Philippines and China, but they set a specific geopolitical and economic context. 2. Timeline: We're asked about events occurring before June 1, 2024, which is earlier than both conditions. This means we need to consider the current state of Philippines-China relations and project forward. 3. Current Philippines-China relations: As of 2023, relations between the two countries are tense due to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The Philippines has been increasingly assertive in defending its maritime claims. 4. Historical precedent: Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between these countries are rare but not unprecedented. In recent years, there have been incidents of heightened tension, but they haven't typically resulted in diplomatic expulsions. 5. Potential triggers: Factors that could lead to diplomatic expulsions or recalls include escalation of maritime disputes, cyber attacks, espionage allegations, or major policy shifts. 6. Global context: The conditions suggest a strong dollar and a close U.S. presidential race, which could indirectly affect Philippines-China relations, potentially increasing regional tensions. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring before June 1, 2024. The ongoing tensions in the South China Sea provide a backdrop for potential escalation. However, both countries have generally shown restraint in taking such drastic diplomatic measures. The conditional nature of the question adds uncertainty. If we assume these conditions are met (strong dollar, close U.S. election), it might suggest a global environment of heightened tensions or economic stress, which could indirectly increase the likelihood of diplomatic incidents. However, diplomatic expulsions are still relatively rare events, and both countries have economic incentives to maintain stable relations. The timeline (before June 1, 2024) also limits the window for such an event to occur.

However, the trend has been towards a stronger dollar against the yen in recent years. For the USD to be worth >=145 JPY by August 9th, 2024, it would require a significant strengthening of the dollar or weakening of the yen. While possible, this is not guaranteed.

As of now (May 2023), polls show a close race between Trump and Biden. For Trump to have a lead between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024, would require a specific scenario. While Trump could potentially lead Biden, the exact margin is difficult to predict. I'd estimate the probability of this precise condition being met at around 15%. (c) Diplomatic expulsions between the Philippines and China: Tensions between the Philippines and China have been escalating, particularly over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The new Philippine administration under President Marcos Jr. has shown a willingness to stand up to Chinese incursions.

Current discourse: Both Trump and Biden have mentioned deepfakes in the past, showing awareness of the technology and its potential impact on elections. 3.

It's unlikely that the mention of 'deepfake' in this debate would dramatically alter the nomination process at such a late stage. 5. Pence's relationship with Trump: Pence's actions on January 6, 2021, and his subsequent distancing from Trump have alienated him from a significant portion of Trump's base, making it difficult for him to secure the nomination. 6.

Let's break it down: 1. Weak AGI achievement: The condition that at least 30% of Manifold respondents agree that weak AGI was achieved before July 23, 2024, suggests a significant technological advancement. This could have various impacts on the political landscape, potentially benefiting or harming either candidate depending on their stance on AI and technology. 2. Crimean Bridge attack: An attack on the Crimean Bridge before July 1, 2024, would likely escalate tensions between Russia and Ukraine, potentially drawing more international attention to the conflict. This could impact US foreign policy discussions and voter perceptions of the candidates' ability to handle international crises. 3. Trump's lead over Biden: The question specifically asks about Trump's lead being between 2 and 4 points on July 15, 2024. This is a relatively narrow range, which makes it less likely to occur compared to a broader range. 4. Timeframe: The poll results we're looking at are from mid-July 2024, which is relatively close to the 2024 US Presidential election. By this time, both campaigns would be in full swing, and voters would be paying more attention to the race. 5. Historical context: In recent US presidential elections, national polls have often shown relatively close races. However, Trump having a lead of 2-4 points would be significant, especially considering Biden is the incumbent president. 6. Impact of conditions on polling: The AGI achievement and Crimean Bridge attack could potentially influence voter perceptions, but their exact impact is hard to predict. The AGI development might be seen as a testament to technological progress under the current administration, while the Crimean Bridge attack might raise questions about global stability and leadership. 7. 538's polling average: 538 is known for its aggregation of multiple polls and sophisticated weighting system, which tends to produce more stable and potentially accurate results compared to individual polls. Given these factors, I believe it's possible but not highly likely that Trump's lead over Biden will fall exactly in the 2-4 point range. The conditions specified (AGI achievement and Crimean Bridge attack) add uncertainty to the prediction, potentially causing shifts in public opinion, but their exact impact is hard to gauge. The narrow range specified (2-4 points) makes this outcome less likely than if we were simply asking whether Trump would be leading.

This is a relatively short time for a CEO tenure, which could work in her favor as she might still be implementing her vision for the company. 2. Twitter's volatility: Twitter has experienced significant turbulence since Elon Musk's acquisition in 2022. The platform has undergone numerous changes and faced various challenges. This instability could potentially lead to leadership changes. 3. Elon Musk's influence: As the owner of Twitter, Elon Musk has shown a tendency to make sudden decisions and changes. His unpredictable nature could affect Yaccarino's position. 4. Yaccarino's background: She comes from a strong media background (former NBCUniversal advertising chief), which could be valuable for Twitter's advertising business. If she performs well in this area, it could solidify her position. 5. Tech industry trends: The tech industry, particularly social media platforms, often sees frequent leadership changes. However, a year is a relatively short time for a CEO transition unless there are significant issues. 6. Company performance: Twitter's performance under Yaccarino's leadership will be crucial. If the company shows improvement in key metrics (user growth, revenue, etc.), it would increase her chances of remaining CEO. 7. Public perception and controversies: How Yaccarino handles public relations and any potential controversies will impact her longevity in the role.

Joe Biden's current status and intentions: As of now (May 2023), Joe Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He officially launched his campaign on April 25, 2023. This indicates a strong commitment to seeking the Democratic Party's nomination. 2. Timing of the question: The resolution date is set for July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in July or August of election years). By this time, the primary process would be largely complete, and it would be highly unusual for a sitting president to withdraw so late in the process. 3. Historical precedent: It is extremely rare for a sitting president eligible for re-election to decline their party's nomination. The last time this happened was in 1968 when Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to seek re-election, but he made this announcement much earlier in the election cycle. 4. Biden's age and health: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, which has raised some concerns about his ability to serve another term. However, he has consistently maintained that he is fit for office and intends to run again. 5. Political landscape: While Biden's approval ratings have fluctuated, there's no clear indication that the Democratic Party is looking to replace him as the nominee. Barring any major scandals or health issues, it's unlikely that the party would push for a change so close to the election. 6. The condition of Linda Yaccarino as CEO: While this is part of the question, it doesn't seem to have a direct bearing on Biden's decision to accept the nomination. There's no apparent connection between Twitter's CEO and Biden's political decisions.

Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the Democratic nomination by July 15, 2024: This is a significant political event that would likely cause market volatility.

Linda Yaccarino as CEO of Twitter on July 1, 2024: Linda Yaccarino was recently appointed as the CEO of Twitter, taking over from Elon Musk. While leadership changes can happen unexpectedly, especially in tech companies, there's a good chance she'll remain in the position for at least a year. However, given Twitter's tumultuous recent history, there's still some uncertainty. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at about 0.7. 2. Joe Biden not accepting Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024: As of now, Joe Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have been adamant about his plans to run again. It would be highly unusual for an incumbent president to suddenly withdraw from the race, especially this close to the election. The probability of Biden announcing he won't accept the nomination is very low, perhaps around 0.05. 3.

The BSE SENSEX is currently around 62,500 (as of May 2023). While it has shown growth over the years, predicting it will be in such a narrow range (75,000 to 76,000) on a specific date is highly improbable. The chance of this exact scenario occurring is very low, perhaps 0.01 or less. For all three conditions to be met, they all need to occur simultaneously.

The consistent polling showing Biden as a weaker candidate than other Democrats is a strong indicator. The 3% threshold is significant but achievable given the current political climate and Biden's perceived weaknesses. However, there are uncertainties to consider.

Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat. 2. Rishi Sunak failing to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election. Let's analyze each part: 1. Trump vs Biden/Generic Democrat: The question suggests that public opinion polls show Biden losing to Trump, while other Democrats perform better. However, it's unclear if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. The 3% threshold is significant but not impossible. Given the current political climate and Biden's approval ratings, it's plausible that Trump could perform better against Biden than a generic Democrat. 2. Rishi Sunak's election prospects: Rishi Sunak is the current Prime Minister of the UK and leader of the Conservative Party. Historically, party leaders usually contest in safe seats to ensure their election. However, the Conservative Party has been facing challenges recently: - The party has been trailing in polls behind the Labour Party. - There have been internal conflicts and policy disagreements within the party. - The UK has faced economic challenges under Conservative leadership. Despite these factors, it's important to note that: - Sunak is an incumbent PM, which typically provides an advantage. - He only needs to win in one constituency to be elected as an MP. - The Conservative Party still has a strong base in many areas of the UK. The connection between Trump's performance and Sunak's election is not direct. While both are conservative politicians, the political landscapes of the US and UK are distinct. Considering all factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Sunak will be elected as an MP, even if Trump performs well against Biden.

However, there are also factors that make this scenario less likely: a) The legal interpretation of the 14th Amendment's application to a former president is not settled. b) Many Republican-controlled states are unlikely to attempt to remove Trump from the ballot. c) Even if some states try to remove Trump, legal challenges could delay or prevent implementation before July 15, 2024.

Public opinion polls show Biden losing to Trump, while generic Democrats perform better. However, Manifold respondents may not be representative of the general public.

(b) Rishi Sunak failing to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election: Sunak is the current Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party. While his party is facing challenges, it's highly unlikely that Sunak would lose his own seat in Parliament. UK party leaders typically run in safe seats. The chances of Sunak not being elected as an MP are very low, probably around 5%. (c) Donald Trump being removed or blocked from any state's primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This is a contentious issue with ongoing legal debates. Some states have considered this action, but it faces significant legal hurdles. As of now, no state has successfully removed Trump from the ballot. While it's possible that a state might attempt this by July 15, 2024, the likelihood of it withstanding legal challenges is low. I'd estimate this has about a 20% chance of occurring. For all three events to occur together, we need to multiply their individual probabilities: 0.40 * 0.05 * 0.20 = 0.004 or 0.4%.

Time frame: We're looking at a 4-day gap between the polling average (July 15) and the forecast (July 19). This is a relatively short period, and dramatic shifts in polling are uncommon in such a short time unless there's a major event. 3. FiveThirtyEight's methodology: 538 doesn't just use the national polling average for their forecasts. They incorporate state-level polls, economic indicators, historical trends, and other factors. This means that even with a national polling lead, the electoral college forecast could potentially favor a different candidate. 4. Historical precedent: In recent elections, candidates leading by 3-4 points in national polls have generally been considered favorites, but upsets have occurred (e.g., 2016). 5. Potential for change: While four days is a short time, it's possible for new polls to be released or for events to occur that could shift the forecast. 6. Electoral college factor: Even with a 3-4 point national lead, the electoral college map could potentially favor Biden if his support is more efficiently distributed in key swing states. Given these considerations, it seems unlikely that Biden would be projected as the favorite on July 19 given Trump's 3-4 point lead on July 15. For Biden to become the favorite, we would need to see either a) A significant shift in polling in just four days b) New state-level polls showing Biden performing much better in key swing states than the national polls suggest c) FiveThirtyEight's model heavily weighting factors other than current polling that favor Biden.

While his health has been generally good, concerns about his age and stamina persist. 3. Political landscape: Biden's approval ratings have been fluctuating, but there's no overwhelming pressure from within the Democratic Party for him to step aside. 4. Time frame: The question asks about dropping out before July 13, 2024, which is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in July or August). 5. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election campaign, especially this close to the election. 6.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would drop out before July 13, 2024. The only scenarios where this might happen would be due to a severe health issue or an unforeseen major political scandal. While these are possible, they are not probable. The time frame (before July 13, 2024) also works against this scenario, as it's very close to the typical convention date.

Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024, and barring any major health issues or scandals, it's improbable that he would drop out before July 2024. 2.

In the 2019 elections, they won 39 out of 751 seats, which is far from being the largest group. The largest groups were the EPP (European People's Party) with 182 seats and S&D (Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats) with 154 seats. 3. Correlation between events: There's no direct causal link between Biden dropping out of the US presidential race and the performance of GUE/NGL in the European elections. European politics are largely independent of US internal politics. 4. Current trends: Recent polls and projections for the 2024 European elections do not indicate a significant surge in support for far-left parties across Europe. Most projections suggest that center-right and center-left parties will continue to dominate. 5. Time frame: Even if Biden were to drop out, the impact on European elections would likely be minimal, especially given the short time frame between July 13 and the European elections (typically held in May-June).

Given that Biden drops out before July 13, we need to consider the process of transferring power: a) If Biden resigns or is unable to serve, the Vice President (currently Kamala Harris) would immediately become President under the 25th Amendment. b) The transfer of power in such cases is typically immediate, with the Vice President being sworn in as soon as possible. c) There is no extended transition period for this type of succession, unlike in elections. Considering these factors, it is highly unlikely that Biden would still be president on July 31 if he drops out before July 13.

This demonstrates that Biden is capable of and willing to participate in longer-format interviews. 2. Election year: 2024 is a presidential election year, and Biden is likely to be the Democratic nominee. As the election approaches, there may be increased pressure and opportunities for Biden to engage in longer, more in-depth interviews to address voter concerns and present his platform. 3. Time frame: The period from now (April 2024) until the end of July 2024 is about three months. This provides ample time for Biden's team to schedule and prepare for a longer interview. 4. Media landscape: There are numerous platforms and shows that could potentially host Biden for a 45+ minute interview, including podcasts, late-night shows, and news programs like 60 Minutes (although the full interview would need to be released to qualify). 5. Campaign strategy: Long-form interviews can be beneficial for candidates to explain their positions in detail and connect with voters. Biden's campaign team may see value in scheduling such an interview as part of their election strategy. 6. Age and stamina concerns: There have been ongoing discussions about Biden's age and stamina. A longer interview could be seen as an opportunity to address these concerns directly. 7. Past behavior: The question notes that many of Biden's recent interviews have been shorter than 45 minutes. This suggests a preference for shorter formats, which could work against the likelihood of a longer interview. 8. Control of narrative: Longer interviews can be riskier as they provide more opportunities for gaffes or misstatements. Biden's team may prefer more controlled, shorter appearances. Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high likelihood that Biden will participate in at least one 45+ minute in-person interview before the end of July 2024.

However, it's worth noting that such long-form interviews are relatively rare for sitting presidents, especially in an election year. Biden has been known to limit his media appearances, but for this question, we assume it happens. Chasiv Yar is a strategically important town in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine, close to Bakhmut. As of April 2024, it's still under Ukrainian control, but Russian forces have been attempting to advance in this area. Factors to consider include the current situation, time frame, strategic importance, Ukrainian resistance, international support, and Russian military capabilities. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Russia could control Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024. The slow but persistent Russian advance in the region suggests they might eventually overcome Ukrainian defenses, especially if Western support wavers or if Ukraine faces resource constraints. However, Ukraine's strong resistance and the strategic importance of the location mean that they will likely fight hard to retain control.

Biden's health and cognitive abilities: The condition of a 45+ minute in-person interview suggests that Biden would be capable of engaging in a lengthy conversation. This could potentially alleviate some concerns about his cognitive abilities, which have been a point of criticism. However, the performance in this interview could also influence public perception and his decision. 2. The situation in Ukraine: The condition of Russia controlling Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024, implies a significant Russian advance in the Donbas region. This could be seen as a failure of Biden's foreign policy and support for Ukraine, potentially damaging his re-election prospects. 3. Political landscape: By July 2024, the Democratic primary process will be well underway. If Biden hasn't already announced his intention to run (or not run) by this point, it would be unusually late in the political cycle. 4. Party pressure: If Biden's performance in polls or his interview is perceived as weak, or if the situation in Ukraine is seen as a major foreign policy failure, there might be increased pressure from within the Democratic Party for Biden to step aside. 5. Personal factors: Biden would be 81 at the start of a second term. He might decide that the demands of the presidency are too great at his age, especially if facing significant challenges domestically and internationally. 6. Timing: The question specifies an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). Making such a late announcement not to accept the nomination would be highly unusual and potentially disruptive to the party. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that Biden would announce he won't accept the nomination under these conditions. Here's why: - If Biden is capable of doing a 45+ minute interview, it suggests he's in reasonable health and cognitive condition, reducing pressure to step aside. - While the situation in Ukraine would be a setback, it's unlikely to be the sole factor in such a major decision. - The very late timing (just before the convention) makes it less likely Biden would make such a disruptive announcement. - If Biden were planning not to run, he would likely make this decision much earlier in the process to allow other candidates to campaign effectively.

Time frame: The question asks about this happening before July 20th, which is about 3 months from now. This provides a significant amount of time for dissent to grow and organize. 5. Threshold: The requirement is for at least 5 named Democratic House Members or Senators to work together in this effort, which is a relatively low number given the size of the Democratic caucus. 6. Political risk: While there's a risk in openly opposing the sitting president of one's own party, the growing concerns about Biden's electability might outweigh this risk for some members. 7. Potential catalysts: Any major gaffes, health concerns, or drops in polling numbers for Biden between now and July could accelerate this process. 8. Party unity considerations: The Democratic Party typically tries to present a united front, especially in election years, which could discourage such a move. Given these factors, I believe there's a significant chance of this occurring. The existing dissent, behind-the-scenes activity, and the relatively low threshold of 5 members make it quite possible.

Israel has conducted operations against Iranian targets in the past, including alleged assassinations and sabotage of nuclear facilities. 3. Current geopolitical situation: As of April 2024, the Middle East remains a volatile region. The ongoing conflicts and tensions in the area could potentially escalate, leading to more aggressive actions from various parties. 4. Time frame: If the condition is met, Israel would have a relatively short window (until May 1, 2024) to carry out an attack.

Considering these factors, while it's possible that Israel could carry out an attack within Iran, it seems unlikely that such an attack would be directly influenced by or timed in response to U.S. domestic political events like Democrats pressuring Biden to drop out.

Condition (b) is more plausible given the current tensions between Israel and Iran. However, a direct attack by Israel on Iranian soil would be a major escalation and could potentially lead to a wider conflict. 3. If both (a) and (b) do occur, it would create a highly volatile political situation. The combination of internal party dissent and a potential international crisis could put significant pressure on Biden's presidency. 4. However, even in this scenario, it's unlikely that 10 or more Democratic Senators would call for Biden to drop out.

It would take an extraordinary set of circumstances for such a large number of Senators to publicly break with the sitting president of their own party. 5. The time frame (before July 20, 2024) is relatively short for such a dramatic political shift to occur, especially considering the presidential election would be just a few months away at that point. 6.

Russian control of Chasiv Yar: Chasiv Yar is a strategically important town in eastern Ukraine. If Russia controls it by June 1, 2024, it would indicate a significant advancement in their military campaign. This could potentially escalate the conflict and increase global tensions. 2. US Core CPI increase: The Core CPI (Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy) is a key measure of inflation. A month-over-month increase of more than 0.1% is not uncommon, but it's also not guaranteed. Potential correlation: - Escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict could lead to increased global economic uncertainty. - This uncertainty might cause disruptions in supply chains and energy markets, potentially putting upward pressure on prices. - However, the Core CPI excludes energy prices, which would be most directly affected by such geopolitical events. - The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions in response to geopolitical tensions could also influence inflation. Historical context: - In recent years, month-over-month Core CPI increases have often exceeded 0.1%, especially during periods of higher inflation. - However, the Fed has been actively working to bring inflation down, and by mid-2024, these efforts might have had a significant impact. Uncertainty factors: - The economic situation in July 2024 will depend on many factors beyond just the Russia-Ukraine conflict. - The Fed's monetary policy decisions leading up to that point will play a crucial role. - Other global economic conditions and domestic factors in the US will also influence inflation. Given these considerations, I believe there's a moderate to high chance that the Core CPI would increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024, even without the condition of Russian control of Chasiv Yar.

This suggests that S&D would need to gain seats or the EPP would need to lose seats for S&D to hold the most seats after the 2024 elections. 2. Political trends: There has been a general trend towards more fragmented politics in Europe, with traditional center-left and center-right parties losing ground to populist, green, and far-right parties.

The application of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to Donald Trump: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. There have been discussions about applying this to Trump due to his alleged role in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. 3.

The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling: In March 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that states cannot unilaterally remove presidential candidates from the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

Current composition: As of 2023, the ID group is the 5th largest group in the European Parliament with 62 MEPs out of 705 total seats. This puts them significantly behind the current leading groups like the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). 2. Recent trends: There has been a rise in populist and far-right parties across Europe in recent years. The ID group, which includes parties like Italy's Lega and France's National Rally, has benefited from this trend. 3. National elections: Recent national elections in some EU countries have shown increased support for parties aligned with ID's ideology. For example, the success of Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, although not part of ID, indicates a shift towards right-wing politics in some member states. 4. European political climate: Issues like immigration, economic challenges, and dissatisfaction with EU policies have fueled support for Eurosceptic and nationalist parties, which could benefit ID. 5. Fragmentation of other groups: Traditional center-right and center-left parties have been losing ground in many countries, which could lead to a more fragmented parliament. 6. Time until elections: With the elections still about a year away, there's potential for significant shifts in public opinion and political landscapes across EU member states. 7. Electoral system: The proportional representation system used in European Parliament elections makes it difficult for any single group to gain a dominant position. Despite these factors potentially favoring ID, it's important to note that they would need to more than double their current seat count to have a chance at becoming the largest group. This is a significant challenge given the diversity of political landscapes across EU member states and the strength of other established groups.

While populist and far-right parties have been gaining ground in Europe, it's still considered unlikely that they would become the largest group. However, this question assumes this condition is met. 2. Even if the ID group were to gain the most seats, it's not immediately clear how this would directly impact Twitter's leadership. Twitter is a US-based company, and while European politics can influence global tech regulations, it's unlikely to cause immediate leadership changes. 3. Linda Yaccarino became CEO of Twitter in June 2023. By July 1, 2024, she would have been in the role for just over a year. 4. The average tenure of tech CEOs is typically longer than one year. According to some studies, the average tenure for tech CEOs is around 6-8 years. 5. Yaccarino was brought in by Elon Musk to help stabilize Twitter's business, particularly in terms of advertiser relationships. Unless there are significant issues or conflicts, it's unlikely she would be replaced so quickly. Given these factors, even if the ID group were to gain the most seats in the European Parliament, it seems unlikely that this would directly lead to Yaccarino's removal as CEO within such a short timeframe. The political shift in Europe, while significant, would probably not have an immediate and direct impact on Twitter's leadership. However, we must consider the volatility of Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership. Musk has made sudden and unexpected decisions in the past, and the tech industry can be unpredictable.

Incumbent advantage: Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party. Historically, incumbent presidents rarely face significant primary challenges, let alone a situation that leads to a brokered convention. 2. Party unity: The Democratic Party has generally shown strong support for Biden, with no major challengers emerging so far. This unity reduces the likelihood of a contested convention. 3. Biden's age and health: At 80 years old, Biden is the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. While he has announced his intention to run for re-election, concerns about his age and health could potentially lead to some party members seeking alternatives. However, this factor alone is unlikely to result in a brokered convention. 4. Delegate allocation rules: The Democratic Party uses proportional allocation of delegates in primaries and caucuses, which makes it easier for a clear front-runner to emerge and secure the nomination before the convention. 5. Historical precedent: Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern American politics. The last time Democrats had a truly brokered convention was in 1952, over 70 years ago. 6. Time until the convention: There is still more than a year until the Democratic National Convention. This provides ample time for the party to coalesce around a single candidate, further reducing the chances of a brokered convention. 7.

The possibility of 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing early virtual nomination: - While there might be some dissent within the party, getting 20 high-profile Democrats to publicly oppose Biden seems unlikely. - Most Democrats would likely prioritize party unity over internal disagreements. - The draft letter by Rep. Jared Huffman indicates some dissatisfaction, but it's unclear if it will gain significant traction. 2. Francis Suarez being the Republican nominee: - Suarez is a relatively unknown figure on the national stage compared to other potential Republican candidates. - He lacks the name recognition and national support base of candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or other high-profile Republicans. - As of now, he is considered a long-shot candidate with very low polling numbers. - The Republican field is likely to be crowded with more established and popular candidates.

However, for this question, we must assume this condition is met. 2. The impact of the Knicks' success on USA Olympic performance: While there's no direct causal link between the Knicks winning the NBA Finals and the USA's Olympic performance, such a surprising victory could potentially boost national morale and interest in basketball, which might have a small positive effect on the Olympic team's preparation and performance. 3. USA's historical Olympic performance: The United States has consistently been a dominant force in the Summer Olympics, topping the medal table in the majority of recent games. They topped the medal table in Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021) with 113 total medals (39 gold). 4. Main competitors: China is typically the USA's closest rival in the medal table. In Tokyo 2020, China finished second with 88 total medals (38 gold). Other strong contenders include ROC (Russian Olympic Committee), Great Britain, and Japan. 5. USA's strengths: The US typically excels in swimming, athletics, and basketball, which contribute significantly to their medal count. The basketball teams (both men's and women's) are usually strong favorites for gold. 6. Potential changes: While the overall landscape of Olympic sports doesn't change dramatically in a 3-year period, there could be shifts in the competitiveness of other nations or changes in Olympic events that could affect the outcome. 7. Home advantage: France, as the host nation, might see a boost in their performance, but this is unlikely to threaten the USA's position at the top of the table. Given these factors, even with the condition of the Knicks winning the NBA Finals (which has no strong direct impact on Olympic performance), the USA remains a very strong favorite to top the medal table at Paris 2024. The US has consistently demonstrated its ability to produce top athletes across a wide range of summer Olympic sports, and there's no clear indication that this dominance will significantly diminish by 2024.

By July 2024, these policies will have been in effect for a considerable time, potentially dampening inflation. 3. Economic conditions: The overall state of the economy, including employment rates, wage growth, and consumer spending, will influence inflation. It's difficult to predict these factors so far in advance. 4. Seasonal factors: July typically sees some increase in prices due to summer travel and spending, but this is usually accounted for in the seasonally adjusted figures. 5.

Let's break it down: 1. Core CPI increase: The condition of Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024 is quite likely. Historically, monthly Core CPI increases have often exceeded 0.1%, especially in recent years with higher inflation. 2. Trump vs. Biden polling: The question asks about a very specific polling lead range (>2 and \u22643) on a specific date (July 15, 2024) according to 538's national polling average. 3. Economic impact on polling: If Core CPI increases significantly, it could negatively impact Biden's approval ratings and potentially boost Trump's polling numbers, as incumbents (or in this case, the incumbent party) often face criticism for poor economic performance. 4. Time frame: The poll date (July 15, 2024) is relatively close to the election, making the polls more meaningful than earlier ones. 5. Specific polling range: The range of >2 to \u22643 is quite narrow, which makes it less likely to hit this exact range. 6. Current polling trends: As of April 2024, polls show a close race between Trump and Biden, with some giving Trump a slight lead. However, these leads are generally within the 0-2 point range. 7. Volatility: Polling can be volatile, especially in response to economic news or other events. 8. 538's methodology: 538 uses a weighted average of multiple polls, which tends to smooth out some of the volatility seen in individual polls. Given these factors, I believe it's possible but not highly probable that Trump's lead will fall exactly in this range on the specified date.

Current situation in Gaza: As of April 2024, Israel has not yet expanded its ground invasion to Rafah. The decision to do so would be a significant escalation. 5. International pressure: There has been considerable international pressure on Israel to avoid a full-scale invasion of Rafah due to the high concentration of civilians there. 6. Strategic considerations: Rafah is the last major population center in Gaza that Israel has not entered. It's also a key border crossing with Egypt. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that Israel will expand its ground invasion to Rafah before June 1, 2024, for the following reasons: a) The anticipation of continued inflation and a potential shift in US leadership might create uncertainty, making Israel hesitant to take such a significant military action. b) International pressure against an invasion of Rafah is likely to remain strong. c) The timeline (before June 1, 2024) is relatively short, and military operations of this scale typically require extensive planning. d) Israel might choose to wait and see how the US political situation develops before making such a major move. However, there are factors that could increase the likelihood: e) If the security situation deteriorates significantly, Israel might feel compelled to act regardless of other considerations. f) The anticipation of a potential Trump presidency might embolden Israel to take more aggressive action.

Question: Will the EU announce new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles before July 5, 2024? 3. Timeline: The condition occurs after the date in question, which makes this scenario highly unlikely. Key considerations: a) Temporal disconnect: The terrorist attack would occur after July 5, 2024, so it couldn't directly influence a decision made before that date. b) EU decision-making process: Even if there were plans to impose tariffs, the EU typically has a lengthy decision-making process that involves multiple stakeholders and stages. c) Existing tensions: There are already ongoing discussions about potential tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in the EU, independent of any terrorist attack. d) Lack of clear connection: There's no obvious link between a terrorist attack in France and tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. e) Probability of a terrorist attack: While not impossible, the likelihood of a terrorist attack during the Olympics is relatively low due to heightened security measures.

Given these factors, while it's possible that the ID group could gain more seats in the 2024 elections, especially considering the geopolitical tensions implied by the scenario, it seems unlikely that they would become the largest group in the European Parliament. The established centrist and center-right groups (like EPP) still have a strong base of support, and the fragmentation of the right makes it difficult for a single group like ID to dominate.

At least 5 named Democratic House Members or US Senators pressuring Biden to drop out before July 20th, 2024: This is highly unlikely. While there may be some concerns about Biden's age and electability, the Democratic Party typically rallies behind incumbent presidents. It would be unprecedented for a significant number of party members to publicly call for the sitting president to drop out. The specific requirements (5 named individuals, working together, before a specific date) make this even less likely. 2. Nvidia's market capitalization being larger than Apple's on July 17, 2024: As of July 2023, Apple's market cap is around $3 trillion, while Nvidia's is around $1 trillion. For this to occur, Nvidia would need to triple its value while Apple remains stagnant, or some combination of Nvidia growing and Apple shrinking. While Nvidia has seen significant growth due to AI advancements, overtaking Apple in just one year seems improbable. 3. CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) being higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024: This is perhaps the most unpredictable of the three. Volatility indices can change rapidly based on market conditions, economic factors, and global events. However, predicting a specific increase on a specific date a year in advance is challenging.

The EU has expressed concerns about Chinese state subsidies giving Chinese EV manufacturers an unfair advantage. 2. EU's protectionist tendencies: The EU has a history of implementing trade measures to protect its domestic industries. With the growing importance of the EV market, there's a strong incentive to support European manufacturers. 3. Time frame: The question gives a timeframe of about 14 months from now (April 2023 to July 2024). This is a considerable amount of time for trade negotiations and policy decisions to take place. 4. Recent developments: In September 2023, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles. This investigation is expected to last 13 months, which would conclude around October 2024, after the resolution date of this question. 5. Political pressure: European automakers have been lobbying for protection against Chinese competition. This internal pressure could accelerate the decision-making process. 6. Global economic factors: The state of the global economy and any potential economic downturns could influence the EU's decision to implement protectionist measures. 7. Diplomatic considerations: The EU might be cautious about imposing tariffs due to potential retaliation from China and the impact on overall EU-China relations. 8. WTO rules: Any new tariffs or duties would need to comply with World Trade Organization rules, which could potentially slow down the process. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high likelihood of the EU announcing new tariffs or duties on Chinese EVs before July 5, 2024.

However, this is not the main focus of our probability assessment. 2. The ongoing legal challenges to Trump's eligibility under the 14th Amendment: There have been attempts to remove Trump from ballots using Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection from holding federal office. Some states have considered or attempted this, but so far, none have successfully removed him from the ballot. 3. The timeline: The question asks about the status as of July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the 2024 presidential election. By this time, most primary elections will have already taken place or be well underway. 4. Legal precedent and constitutional interpretation: The use of the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates is largely unprecedented in modern times. Courts have been hesitant to intervene in such matters without clear legislative guidance. 5. Political considerations: Removing a major candidate from the ballot is an extreme step that could face significant political backlash and challenges. 6. State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently, potentially leading to varied outcomes across the country. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Trump to be removed from a ballot under the 14th Amendment, it seems unlikely to happen by July 15, 2024. The legal and political hurdles are significant, and courts have so far been reluctant to take such a drastic step. Even if one state were to attempt this, it would likely face immediate legal challenges that could prevent it from taking effect by the specified date.

This puts them significantly behind the current largest groups like EPP (European People's Party) and S&D (Socialists and Democrats). 2. Recent trends: There has been a rise in right-wing and Eurosceptic sentiment across Europe in recent years, which could potentially benefit ECR. However, this trend hasn't been uniform across all EU member states. 3. Brexit impact: The UK's departure from the EU removed a significant number of ECR MEPs, weakening their position.

Upcoming national elections: The outcomes of national elections in various EU member states leading up to 2024 could influence the composition of the European Parliament. 5. Fragmentation of the right: While there's a trend towards right-wing politics, this vote is often split between ECR and other right-wing groups like ID (Identity and Democracy), potentially diluting ECR's strength. 6.

Regular attendance: While I don't have specific information about Mayor Wilson's attendance record, mayors generally make it a priority to attend city council meetings. 4. Flexibility of attendance options: The question states that attending via Zoom with camera on and self-identification counts as attendance, which increases the likelihood of the mayor's participation even if he can't be there in person. 5. Potential conflicts: Without specific information about the mayor's schedule or any conflicting events, it's difficult to account for potential obstacles to his attendance. 6. Day of the week: July 29th, 2024, is a Monday, which is a typical workday and common for scheduling city council meetings. 7.

Historically, core CPI often increases by more than 0.1% month-over-month, but not always. We might estimate this at around 60-70% probability.

Political landscape: As of July 2024, Kamala Harris is likely the Vice President, and her chances of becoming the Democratic nominee for the 2024 election would depend on whether President Biden is running for re-election or not. 4.

Here's why: - If Biden is running for re-election, it's improbable that Harris would have such high odds as a potential replacement. - If Biden is not running, Harris might be a frontrunner, but reaching 46.6% in Electoral College probability against all potential Republican candidates in just a week seems challenging. - Major shifts in electoral probabilities typically require significant events or a consistent trend in polling data, which are less likely to occur in a single week.

Kamala Harris's odds increasing: If Harris's probability of winning the Electoral College increases to over 46.6%, it would indicate a significant shift in her perceived electability. This could cause concern among Democrats about Biden's chances in the general election. 2. Biden's in-person interview: A lengthy in-person interview could potentially expose any cognitive decline or health issues Biden might be experiencing. If he performs poorly, it could further fuel concerns about his ability to serve effectively as president. 3. Early virtual nomination plan: This suggests the Democratic Party leadership is trying to solidify Biden's position as the nominee quickly, possibly to prevent challenges or doubts from arising. 4. The timeframe: The resolution date is set for August 10, 2024, but the letter must be signed by July 21, 2024. This gives Democrats about two weeks to react to the potential changes in Harris's odds and Biden's interview performance. Given these factors, there are several reasons why 20 Democrats might oppose an early Biden nomination: 1. Concerns about electability: If Harris's odds improve significantly, some Democrats might view her as a stronger candidate against the Republican nominee. 2. Worries about Biden's performance: If Biden's interview raises doubts about his capabilities, more Democrats might push for an alternative candidate. 3. Desire for a more open process: Some Democrats might oppose an early nomination on principle, preferring a more democratic process that allows for potential alternatives. However, there are also factors that make this scenario less likely: 1. Party unity: Democrats may prioritize presenting a united front over internal disagreements, especially this close to the election. 2. Limited time: The window for organizing and gathering signatures on a letter is quite short, which could make it difficult to reach 20 signatories. 3. Political risk: Openly opposing the sitting president of one's own party carries significant political risk, which might deter some lawmakers. 4. Uncertainty: The conditions (Harris's odds and Biden's interview) might not materialize as described, or their impact might be less significant than anticipated. Considering all these factors, I believe it's possible but not highly probable that 20 Democrats would sign such a letter. The conditions described could certainly cause concern, but the political risks and the short timeframe make it challenging to gather that many signatures."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "9df82e25-74a3-40ee-ae1a-3f8ebf98513f", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) Kamala's odds of winning increase over the next week according to Nate Silver's model (b) Joe Biden have an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024 (c) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early?", "body": "(a) Resolves YES if the Electoral College probability for Harris in Nate Silver's model is >46.6% on Friday August 9th at 8:40 PM.

Diplomatic tensions between the Philippines and China: This scenario suggests an escalation of tensions in the South China Sea, which could divert international attention and resources. 3. Israel attacking Iran: Israel and Iran have long-standing tensions, and Israel has conducted covert operations against Iran's nuclear program in the past. Given these events occur, several factors need to be considered: a) The power vacuum created by Biden's resignation might embolden Israel to take more aggressive action against Iran, believing that the US might be less likely to intervene or object during a transition period. b) Increased tensions in the South China Sea could potentially divert US attention and resources away from the Middle East, giving Israel more freedom to act. c) However, it's important to note that Israel typically acts based on its own security interests and threat perceptions regarding Iran, rather than being primarily influenced by US politics or events in East Asia. d) The timeframe for the attack (before May 1, 2024) is relatively short, considering the question is created in April 2024. This leaves little time for the situation to develop and for Israel to plan and execute a major attack. e) The requirement for at least five deaths sets a relatively low bar for what constitutes an attack, making it more likely to occur than if it required a large-scale operation. While these events might create a more favorable environment for Israel to act against Iran, it's still a significant step with major international repercussions. Israel would likely only take such action if it perceived an immediate threat from Iran's nuclear program or other activities.

Let's analyze each part separately: 1. Joe Biden dropping out and resigning before the end of July 2024: This is highly unlikely. Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, there are no credible indications that he plans to drop out or resign. Barring a severe health crisis or an unprecedented political development, the probability of this occurring is extremely low. 2. Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before June 1, 2024: This is more plausible given the ongoing tensions between the two countries, particularly regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea. However, while diplomatic spats are common, full expulsions or recalls are still relatively rare. The probability of this occurring is moderate but not high. 3. Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024: This is the most likely of the three events. There is a history of covert operations and tensions between Israel and Iran. Israel has been known to carry out targeted assassinations and sabotage operations within Iran. However, the requirement for at least five deaths makes this more challenging. The probability of this occurring is moderate to high. For the entire question to resolve YES, all three of these events must occur.

The women's team has been even more dominant, winning gold in every Olympics since 1996 (7 consecutive golds). 2. Current team strength: While the final rosters aren't set yet, the USA typically fields teams composed of NBA and WNBA stars, giving them a significant talent advantage over most other nations. 3. International competition: Other countries have been improving in basketball, with teams like Spain, France, Australia, and Serbia becoming more competitive in recent years. However, the USA still remains the favorite in both men's and women's competitions. 4. Recent performances: The USA men's team won gold in Tokyo 2021, while the women's team continued their streak. This shows that their dominance is still ongoing. 5. Coaching: USA Basketball typically selects experienced, high-caliber coaches for the Olympic teams, which adds to their advantage. 6. Pressure and expectations: The high expectations can sometimes lead to underperformance, as seen in the men's 2004 bronze medal finish. 7. Potential for upsets: In a single-elimination tournament format, there's always a chance for an upset, especially if the USA faces a hot-shooting team on an off day. 8. The need to win both: For this prediction to be true, both teams need to win gold, which slightly decreases the overall probability compared to each team's individual chances. Given these factors, the USA is still the clear favorite in both competitions. The women's team seems more likely to secure gold given their unbroken streak and continued dominance. The men's team, while still favored, faces slightly stiffer competition.

The terrorist threat level in France: - France has been a target of terrorist attacks in the past. - Major international events like the Olympics can be attractive targets for terrorists. - French security services are likely to be on high alert during the Olympics. 3. Security measures during the Olympics: - Olympic host countries typically implement extensive security measures. - France has experience in hosting major international events and dealing with security threats. - The French government is likely to deploy significant resources to ensure safety. 4. The timeframe and geographical scope: - The question covers a relatively short period (17 days) and a specific area (metropolitan France). - This limited scope reduces the likelihood of an attack compared to a longer timeframe or larger area. 5. Recent global and local security trends: - While the threat of terrorism remains a concern globally, the frequency of major attacks in Western Europe has decreased in recent years. - However, the situation can change rapidly, and new threats can emerge. 6. Definition of a terrorist attack: - The question uses a broad definition that includes any event described as terrorism by French officials, which could potentially include smaller-scale incidents.

For example, Michael Phelps (2008, 2012, 2016) and Caeleb Dressel (2021) have been top gold medal winners in their respective Olympics. 4. Competition from other sports: - Track and field also offers many medal opportunities, but it's harder for a single athlete to dominate across multiple events compared to swimming. - Gymnastics can produce multiple gold medalists, but typically not as many as swimming. 5. Current swimming stars: - While we don't know who will be competing in 2024, there are several strong swimmers who could potentially win multiple gold medals, such as Caeleb Dressel, Katie Ledecky, and emerging talents. 6. Unpredictability of sports: - While swimming has a good chance of producing the top gold medalist, unexpected performances in other sports could always occur.

Tucker Carlson as Republican nominee: This would be a highly controversial choice, potentially energizing the Democratic base but also presenting a formidable media-savvy opponent. This might push Democrats to seek a strong, unified candidate. 2. Biden declared incapacitated: This would create a power vacuum in the Democratic Party. While Vice President Kamala Harris would become Acting President, she may not automatically become the party's nominee. 3. Timing: The scenario occurs before August 2024, giving Democrats limited time to coalesce around a new candidate before their convention. 4. Party unity: In times of crisis, parties often try to present a united front. However, the sudden need for a new candidate could also bring long-simmering factional disputes to the surface. 5. Potential candidates: Besides Harris, other prominent Democrats (e.g., Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders) might see this as an opportunity to step forward, potentially splitting the party. 6. Desire for stability: Given the unusual circumstances, there might be pressure to quickly rally behind a single candidate to project stability and readiness to govern. 7. Democratic Party rules: The party's superdelegate system, while reformed, could still play a role in influencing the outcome. Given these factors, I believe there's a significant chance of a brokered convention. The sudden removal of an incumbent president would likely lead to multiple candidates vying for the nomination. While there would be pressure to unify quickly, the diverse factions within the Democratic Party and the high stakes of facing Tucker Carlson might make it difficult to reach consensus in a single ballot. However, it's not a certainty. The party leadership might work hard behind the scenes to avoid a public display of disunity, potentially pressuring all but one or two candidates to step aside before the convention.

Career trajectory: Shyamalan's recent films have shown improvement compared to his mid-career slump. His last five films have an average score of 59.8%, which is very close to the 60% threshold. 3. Genre and expectations: 'Trap' is described as a psychological thriller, a genre Shyamalan is known for. His success often depends on how well he executes his signature twist endings and how audiences receive them. 4. Critical reception patterns: Shyamalan's films often divide critics. Some appreciate his unique storytelling, while others find his twists predictable or forced. 5. Production details: As of now, we don't have much information about the cast, budget, or production quality of 'Trap,' which could influence its reception. 6. Evolution as a filmmaker: Shyamalan has shown signs of learning from past criticisms and adapting his style, which could potentially lead to improved reception. 7. Unpredictability: Shyamalan's scores can be quite volatile, ranging from very low (e.g., 'The Happening' at 17%) to very high (e.g., 'The Sixth Sense' at 86%). Given these factors, I believe 'Trap' has a slightly better than even chance of reaching the 60% threshold. Shyamalan's recent trend is positive, with two out of his last three films surpassing 60%.

For this to happen: a) Biden's health or mental capacity would need to decline significantly. b) The Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet would need to agree to invoke Section 4. c) This would need to happen before August 2024. Biden has shown no signs of severe incapacitation that would warrant such an extreme measure. While concerns about his age and occasional gaffes exist, these are far from the level required for invoking the 25th Amendment. The political ramifications of such a move would be enormous, making it highly unlikely unless Biden's condition deteriorated dramatically. Moreover, the scenario suggests a connection between Carlson's nomination and Biden's incapacitation, which seems speculative at best. There's no clear causal link between these events.

Historical precedent: Russian athletes were banned from competing under their national flag at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics due to doping scandals.

The IOC is under pressure to maintain the integrity of the games while also considering the principle of non-discrimination. The most probable outcome appears to be that a limited number of Russian athletes might be allowed to compete under a neutral flag, similar to previous Olympics. This scenario would likely fall within the 34-athlete limit specified in the question, resulting in a 'Yes' resolution.

However, this is not directly related to the main question about Biden's incapacitation. 2. The likelihood of Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4: This is an extremely rare and serious action that has never been invoked in U.S. history.

Market shenanigans: The creator mentions being 'embroiled in some market shenanigans,' which could generate additional interest and discussion, potentially drawing more traders. 7. Embedded market: The fact that this market is embedded in another market could create a network effect, exposing it to more potential traders. 8. Rate of growth: To reach the target, the market needs to attract about 2.6 new traders per day on average, which seems achievable given the current base and the factors mentioned above. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that the market will reach 377 traders by July 15. The self-referential nature of the market, combined with the creator's following and the potential for discussion around the 'market shenanigans,' creates a strong incentive for people to participate. The target of 78 additional traders over a month is challenging but appears achievable given the circumstances. However, there's always uncertainty in predicting human behavior and market dynamics.

Current political landscape in India: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is currently the ruling party in India, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They have been in power since 2014 and won a significant majority in the 2019 general election. 3. BJP's performance and popularity: The BJP has maintained a strong base of support, particularly in northern and western India. Modi remains a popular figure among many Indians, despite some controversies and challenges during his tenure. 4. Opposition parties: The main opposition, the Indian National Congress, has struggled to present a united front and hasn't been able to mount a significant challenge to the BJP at the national level. 5. Recent state elections: While the BJP has faced some setbacks in state elections, they have also had significant victories, demonstrating their continued electoral strength. 6. Economic factors: India's economy has faced challenges, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has shown signs of recovery. The BJP's handling of the economy will be a key factor in the election. 7. Time until the election: The next general election is expected in May 2024, which is still some time away.

Given these factors, the BJP appears to be in a strong position to form the government after the next Indian general election.

Let's break it down: 1. Condition (a): The linked market getting at least 377 traders by July 15, 2023, is a specific condition that doesn't directly relate to the European Parliamentary Elections or Indian politics. This condition seems to be more about the popularity or engagement of the prediction market itself. 2. Condition (b): The BJP forming the government after the next Indian general election in 2024 is more relevant to global politics, but still not directly connected to European politics. 3. The main question: Whether the ID political group will hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections. The ID (Identity and Democracy) group is a right-wing to far-right political group in the European Parliament. As of 2023, it's not the largest group in the European Parliament. The current largest group is the European People's Party (EPP), followed by the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). For the ID group to hold the most seats after the 2024 elections, there would need to be a significant shift in European politics towards more right-wing and nationalist sentiments. While there has been a rise in populist and nationalist movements in some European countries, it's not clear that this trend is strong enough to make the ID group the largest in the Parliament. The conditions about the prediction market traders and the BJP forming the Indian government don't seem to have a direct causal relationship with European Parliament elections. However, they might be indicators of broader global trends towards populism and nationalism, which could indirectly influence European politics. Given the current political landscape in Europe, the historical performance of far-right parties in European elections, and the lack of direct connection between the given conditions and European politics, it seems unlikely that the ID group will hold the most seats after the 2024 elections. However, political landscapes can change rapidly, and unexpected events can shift public opinion. The rise of right-wing populism in various parts of the world (as potentially indicated by the BJP's success in India) could have some influence on European politics.

With new sports and continued development of Olympic programs worldwide, reaching 5 is feasible.

The likelihood of the same nation winning more than one women's team sport: This is a more challenging condition to meet. There are eight women's team sports in the Olympics, and historically, these have been dominated by different countries with strengths in specific sports. For example: - USA is strong in basketball (both 5x5 and 3x3) and volleyball - Netherlands is strong in field hockey - Norway and France are strong in handball - Australia and New Zealand are strong in rugby sevens - USA and Spain are strong in water polo - USA, Germany, and Sweden are strong in football For a single country to win more than one of these sports, they would need to have exceptional strength across multiple team disciplines. The most likely candidate would be the USA, given their historical performance in basketball and volleyball. However, there are several factors that make this less likely: a) Increased global competitiveness: More countries are investing in women's sports, leading to a more even playing field. b) Specialization: Countries often focus on excelling in specific sports rather than spreading resources across many. c) The nature of team sports: Upsets are more common in team sports due to the complexity of team dynamics and the impact of a single game deciding the outcome.

At least 5 countries winning their first Olympic medal: This is quite possible but not guaranteed. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, three countries (San Marino, Burkina Faso, and Turkmenistan) won their first Olympic medals. The number of new medal-winning countries tends to decrease over time as more countries have already won medals. However, with 206 National Olympic Committees and only about 150 having won medals, there's still room for new winners. Given the trend and the number of remaining countries without medals, I'd estimate this has about a 40% chance of occurring. 2. The same nation winning more than one women's team sport: This is challenging but not impossible. The United States is a strong contender in multiple team sports, particularly in basketball (both 3x3 and 5x5) and volleyball. Other countries like Australia (basketball, rugby sevens) and the Netherlands (field hockey, football) could also potentially achieve this. However, competition is fierce, and upsets are common in team sports. I'd estimate this has about a 30% chance of happening. 3.

While it's certainly possible for Kalenjin athletes to win both races, it's far from guaranteed. I'd estimate this has about a 25% chance of occurring.

While there have been discussions about Biden's age and mental acuity, there's no strong indication that his cabinet or the Vice President are considering such a drastic move. The political ramifications would be enormous, and it would likely only occur in case of a severe health crisis or clear cognitive decline, which we have not seen evidence of at this point. 2. Silver price: As of July 2023, silver is trading around $23-$24 per ounce. To reach $30.50 by August 2024, it would need to increase by about 30%, which is significant but not impossible. Silver prices are influenced by various factors including industrial demand, investment demand, and overall economic conditions. The interaction between these events: If the 25th Amendment were invoked, it would likely cause significant political and economic uncertainty. In times of uncertainty, precious metals like silver often see increased demand as a safe haven, which could drive up the price. However, the overall economic impact could be negative, potentially reducing industrial demand for silver. Given the low probability of the 25th Amendment being invoked, and the uncertainty around silver prices even if it were, the overall probability of both events occurring is quite low.

Joe Biden's presidency: As of now (June 2023), Joe Biden is the current US president, and his term is set to end in January 2025.

While there are potential female candidates (e.g., Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren), it's not guaranteed that a woman will be the nominee. However, for this question, we're assuming this condition is met. 3. South African presidential election: The key part of this question is whether South Africa will elect a president before July 1, 2024. Let's examine this: a. South Africa's last general election was in May 2019, and their presidential terms last for 5 years. b. The next general election is expected to be held between May and August 2024. c. In South Africa, the president is elected by the National Assembly (parliament) after the general election, not directly by the people. d. The exact date for the next election hasn't been set yet, but it's likely to be in May or June 2024. e. After the election, it typically takes a few weeks for the new parliament to convene and elect a president. Given these factors, it's highly likely that South Africa will hold its general election before July 1, 2024. However, the question specifically asks if a president will be elected before this date. If the election is held in early to mid-May 2024, there would likely be enough time for the new parliament to convene and elect a president before July 1. However, if the election is held in late May or June, it's less likely that a president would be elected before July 1.

Biden is currently the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. For this condition to be met, either Biden would need to step aside (which seems unlikely given his stated intentions to run), or be replaced as the nominee at the Democratic National Convention (which would be highly unusual).

South African presidential election before July 1, 2024: South Africa's next general election is scheduled for 2024, but the exact date hasn't been set as of the creation date of this question. The election must be held within 90 days of the National Assembly's five-year term expiring. The current National Assembly's term began on May 22, 2019, so it would expire on May 21, 2024. This means the election must be held by mid-August 2024 at the latest.

Unless there's a significant shift in voter sentiment or a major scandal, it's highly probable that the Republicans will retain this seat. 2. Kamala Harris becoming President or Acting President by July 26, 2024: This is highly unlikely. For this to happen, President Biden would need to resign, be removed from office, or become incapacitated. While Biden is the oldest serving president, there are no indications of imminent health issues or plans to step down. Impeachment also seems unlikely given the current political landscape. 3. Trump's lead over Biden being between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024: This is a very specific range, which makes it less likely. While Trump has been leading in some polls, the exact margin is subject to fluctuation. Polling averages tend to change over time, and predicting a precise range months in advance is challenging. However, recent polls have shown Trump with leads in this general range, so it's not entirely implausible. For this question to resolve as YES, all three of these events must occur together.

Trump's specific poll lead: ~0.15 The combined probability would be: 0.9 * 0.05 * 0.15 = 0.00675.

Biden's intention to run: Biden has announced his intention to seek re-election in 2024, which further solidifies his position as the party's candidate. 3.

Given these factors, the probability of another Democratic party presidential debate occurring before the 2024 convention is quite low. The combination of Biden's incumbent status, his declared intention to run, the lack of serious challengers, and the party's likely desire for unity all point towards a scenario where debates are unnecessary and unlikely.

The first two conditions are hypothetical, so we need to focus on the likelihood of the third condition occurring if the first two are met. Several factors make this scenario unlikely: 1. Timing: The window between Biden's hypothetical announcement (July 15) and the deadline for Senators to call for him to drop out (July 20) is very short - only 5 days. This leaves little time for Senators to organize and make public statements. 2. Redundancy: If Biden has already announced he won't accept the nomination, there would be little point in Senators calling for him to drop out. He would have effectively already done so. 3. Party unity: Democratic Senators would likely be more focused on rallying behind a new candidate rather than calling for Biden to drop out of a race he's already left. 4. Political risk: Publicly calling for a sitting president of your own party to drop out, especially after he's already announced he won't run, could be seen as divisive and potentially damaging to the party's chances in the upcoming election. 5. Economic factor: While a CPI increase might normally be concerning, in this scenario, it would likely be overshadowed by the much bigger news of Biden's withdrawal.

Time frame: The question asks about a specific short-term period (approximately 2.5 months from the creation date to the resolution date). The probability of death in such a short time frame is generally low for any individual, barring known severe health issues. 5. Historical precedent: No U.S. president has died in office since John F. Kennedy in 1963, and none have died of natural causes while in office since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945. 6.

The current status of the Pandemic Agreement: As of now (2023), negotiations for the Pandemic Agreement are ongoing, with the aim to have it ready for consideration at the 77th World Health Assembly in May 2024. 4. U.S. involvement: The United States, under Biden's administration, has been actively involved in the negotiations for the Pandemic Agreement. However, there has been some opposition from Republican lawmakers who are concerned about potential infringements on national sovereignty. 5. Global consensus: The approval of the Pandemic Agreement would require a broad consensus among WHO member states, not just the U.S. Given these factors, we can conclude that: a) The conditional event (Biden's death) would occur after the WHA, so it wouldn't directly impact the approval process. b) The current administration's support for the agreement would likely continue until the WHA in May 2024. c) The global nature of the agreement means that while the U.S. position is important, it's not the only factor in its approval. However, there are still uncertainties: d) The final text of the agreement is not yet known, and negotiations are ongoing. e) The level of support from other countries is not entirely clear. f) Domestic U.S. politics could influence the negotiation process leading up to the WHA.

Biden's commitment: President Joe Biden has repeatedly expressed his intention to run for re-election in 2024 and has publicly stated his support for Harris as his running mate. 3. Democratic Party unity: The party generally aims to present a united front, and changing the VP nominee could be seen as a sign of instability or lack of confidence in the administration. 4.

Estonia qualified in 2023 but not in 2022. 3. Competition format: Only 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the final, making it competitive. 4. Unpredictability: Eurovision results can be unpredictable due to factors like song quality, performance, and geopolitical voting patterns. 5. Time until the event: As the question is being asked almost a year before Eurovision 2024, we don't know the songs, performers, or other competing countries yet, which adds uncertainty. Given these factors, we can make the following assessments: Estonia has the strongest track record and seems the most likely to qualify. Croatia has been inconsistent but has shown recent improvement. Belgium has struggled in recent years and appears to be the least likely of the three to qualify. The probability of all three qualifying is the product of their individual probabilities of qualifying. Even if we optimistically estimate each country's chances at 60-70%, the combined probability would be significantly lower. Considering all these factors, especially the requirement for all three countries to qualify and the time until the event, I would estimate a relatively low probability for this outcome."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.005465458493227993, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0013663646233069981, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1272859202829144, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Let's break down the factors to consider: 1. Assassination attempt on Trump: An assassination attempt on a former president and potential candidate would likely cause significant turmoil within the Republican Party. It could either rally support around Trump or cause the party to distance itself from him, depending on the circumstances and public reaction. 2. Kamala Harris as Democratic VP nominee: This suggests that Joe Biden would likely be running for re-election, maintaining the status quo for the Democratic ticket. 3. Larry Elder as potential Republican nominee: Elder is a conservative talk radio host and political commentator who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of California in 2021. While he has some name recognition and support among conservatives, he is not currently considered a frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination. Given these factors, it's highly unlikely that Larry Elder would become the Republican nominee: a) Trump's strong base of support within the Republican Party would likely be energized by an assassination attempt, potentially increasing his chances of securing the nomination if he chooses to run. b) If Trump were to withdraw from the race due to the attempt on his life, more established Republican figures (e.g., Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, Nikki Haley) would likely have a better chance of securing the nomination than Elder. c) Elder's lack of national political experience and his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in California would likely work against him in a national primary race. d) The Republican establishment would probably prefer a candidate with broader appeal and a stronger track record in elected office. e) The timeframe between the hypothetical shooting (July 13th) and the typical timing of the Republican National Convention (usually in July or August) is very short, making it unlikely for a relatively unknown candidate like Elder to gain enough traction to secure the nomination.

The connection between the two events: There is no direct causal relationship between Mathieu van der Poel's performance against Wout van Aert in the Men's Olympic Road Race and Sifan Hassan's medal prospects in her events. 2. Sifan Hassan's capabilities: Hassan is a highly accomplished athlete, having won two gold medals (5000m and 10,000m) and a bronze medal (1500m) at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She holds multiple world records and is known for her versatility across middle and long-distance events. 3.

Mathieu van der Poel vs Wout van Aert: Both are top cyclists, but van der Poel has shown slightly better form in recent years, especially in one-day races. However, the difference is marginal.

In fact, he has repeatedly stated that he has no interest in running for office. 3. The structure of the Republican nomination process: The Republican Party typically nominates a single candidate for president. The idea of having two nominees (one for president and one for vice president) is determined after the presidential nominee is chosen. The presidential nominee usually selects their running mate. 4. Conditional nature of the question: The question is conditional on Doug Burgum being the nominee, which is already a very unlikely event. Given this condition, we need to consider whether Tucker Carlson would be chosen as a running mate or in some other capacity as a 'nominee.' 5. Historical precedent: There is no precedent in modern American politics for a major party to have two presidential nominees. The party always selects one presidential nominee who then chooses a vice presidential running mate. Given these factors, the probability of this scenario occurring is extremely low. Even if Doug Burgum were to become the nominee (which is highly improbable), it's very unlikely that Tucker Carlson would be selected as a co-nominee or running mate. Carlson has shown no interest in running for office, and his selection would be unprecedented in American politics. The only conceivable scenario where this might occur is if there was a major upheaval in the Republican Party leading to a complete restructuring of how nominees are selected, but this is extremely unlikely. Probability: 0.0001 (or 0.01%) This extremely low probability reflects the near-impossibility of this scenario occurring, given the current political landscape and historical precedents. However, it's not assigned a flat zero because in politics, while highly improbable, almost nothing is truly impossible."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "2f4ea292-2f58-4942-a4c6-c4b44e4c1f9d", "title": "Given Doug Burgum and Tucker Carlson are the Republican nominees, will Kamala Harris be the Democratic VP nominee?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Both Doug Burgum and Tucker Carlson are selected by the Republican National Convention as nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Let's break it down: 1. Trump's lead over Biden: The question assumes this condition is met, so we don't need to factor in its probability. 2. COVID, influenza, and RSV peaks: We need to consider whether these three respiratory illnesses will peak within four weeks of each other in the 2023-24 season. Historical data suggests that these illnesses often have overlapping seasons, but their peaks don't always align perfectly: - COVID-19 has shown less predictable patterns, with potential peaks occurring at various times throughout the year. - Influenza typically peaks between December and February in the Northern Hemisphere. - RSV usually peaks in late fall to early winter. The fact that we're looking at a four-week window increases the likelihood of alignment, as it allows for some variation in peak timing. 3. Hospitalization rates: The question asks about the maximum weekly rate of hospitalizations for each illness occurring within four weeks of the combined peak. This adds another layer of complexity, as hospitalization rates may lag behind infection rates and could be influenced by factors such as vaccination rates, new variants, and public health measures. 4. Data reporting and analysis: The use of CDC's RESP-NET data and epidemiological weeks provides a standardized measure, which helps in accurately determining the timing of peaks. Given these factors, there's a reasonable chance that the peaks could align within the four-week window, especially considering: - The natural overlap in seasonal respiratory illness patterns - The four-week window allowing for some variation - The potential for one severe outbreak to influence the others due to weakened immune systems or behavioral changes However, the exact alignment of peaks for all three illnesses within such a specific timeframe is still a relatively rare occurrence.

Impact of Indian politics on global markets: While India is an important emerging market, its political outcomes typically don't have a significant direct impact on the S&P 500 or its volatility.

The BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been in power since 2014 and won a decisive victory in 2019.

Witness tampering is one of the potential charges being considered, based on Trump's communications with Georgia officials. 4. The investigation has been moving forward steadily, with a special grand jury empaneled in May 2022. However, there are also factors that could delay or prevent charges: 1. High-profile cases often take longer than expected due to their complexity. 2. Trump's legal team may employ various strategies to delay proceedings. 3. Political considerations might influence the timing of any charges. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that Trump could be charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024. The investigation seems to be progressing, and witness tampering is a key focus. However, the timeline is not certain, and various factors could cause delays."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "33f13222-0c67-4a50-ba91-5ac5d3bd8dd9", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) BJP forms the government after the next Indian general election in 2024 (b) The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index is higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024 (c) Donald Trump is charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024?", "body": "(a) The BJP must have a member sworn in as the next Indian Prime Minister following the next general elections expected for May 2024.

The price of silver closing above $30.50 on August 9th, 2024 2. The Greens\u2013EFA political group holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections. Let's analyze each event separately: 1. Silver price: As of April 2023, the price of silver is around $25 per ounce. Reaching $30.50 by August 2024 would require a significant increase, but it's not impossible given the volatility of precious metals markets. However, predicting specific prices for commodities over a year in advance is highly uncertain. 2. Greens\u2013EFA performance in European Parliament elections: The Greens\u2013EFA group currently holds 72 out of 705 seats in the European Parliament, making them the 4th largest group. To hold the most seats after the 2024 elections, they would need to dramatically increase their representation, surpassing larger groups like the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). While environmental concerns are growing in Europe, it's unlikely that the Greens\u2013EFA would gain enough seats to become the largest group in the European Parliament. Historical voting patterns and current political trends don't suggest such a dramatic shift. Moreover, there's no clear causal relationship between the price of silver and the performance of the Greens\u2013EFA in European elections.

Let's break down each component and analyze their potential effects: 1. Silver price above $30.50 on August 9th, 2024: Silver prices are often seen as an indicator of inflation expectations. A high silver price could suggest inflationary pressures in the economy. However, the specified price of $30.50 is not exceptionally high compared to historical levels, so this alone doesn't strongly indicate high inflation. 2. Greens\u2013EFA holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections: This would represent a significant shift in European politics towards more environmentally-focused policies. Such policies could potentially lead to increased costs in various sectors, which might have some inflationary impact globally. However, the direct impact on US inflation would likely be limited. 3. US Core CPI increase in July 2024: The question asks about a very specific month-over-month increase of more than 0.1% in Core CPI. Historical data shows that monthly Core CPI increases of this magnitude are common but not guaranteed. In recent years, monthly increases have often been around 0.2-0.3%, but there have also been months with lower increases. Considering these factors: - The silver price condition suggests some inflationary pressure, but not extreme. - The European election result would likely have a limited direct impact on US inflation in the short term. - The specific month (July 2024) is far in the future, making precise predictions difficult. - Recent trends in US Core CPI have shown persistent inflation, often above 0.1% month-over-month. Given these considerations, it seems more likely than not that the Core CPI would increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024, assuming the conditions are met.

However, Georgia is not currently involved in any major international conflicts that might significantly impact voting.

Given that Georgia qualifies in this scenario, it suggests that the overall quality of entries might be somewhat unpredictable or that voting patterns may have shifted. This could potentially benefit Czechia as well. However, Czechia's qualification is not guaranteed just because Georgia qualifies. Their chances are influenced by their own performance, the quality of other entries in their semi-final, and voting patterns.

Some of these are related to his actions surrounding the January 6th Capitol riot and attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. 3. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This section prohibits individuals who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding federal office. There have been discussions about using this to disqualify Trump from running. 4. Previous attempts: In 2022, there were attempts in some states (e.g., New Mexico) to use the 14th Amendment to block Trump from the ballot, but these were unsuccessful. 5. State-level actions: Different states may have varying interpretations and applications of the 14th Amendment. Some states might be more inclined to take action than others. 6.

Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability that Trump could be removed or blocked from at least one state's primary ballot under the 14th Amendment. The ongoing legal challenges and investigations into Trump's actions related to January 6th could provide grounds for such action. However, the unprecedented nature of using the 14th Amendment in this way, combined with the potential for lengthy legal battles, makes it far from certain. The fact that only one state needs to take this action for the question to resolve as 'Yes' increases the probability. However, the relatively late resolution date (July 15, 2024) means that many primaries will have already taken place, potentially reducing the number of states where this could occur.

Linda Yaccarino's recent appointment: Linda Yaccarino was recently appointed as the CEO of Twitter, taking over from Elon Musk. This happened in May 2023, which is relatively recent. 2. Stability of Twitter's leadership: Twitter has seen significant changes in leadership and direction since Elon Musk's acquisition. However, appointing Yaccarino seems to be a move towards stabilizing the company's leadership. 3. Yaccarino's background: She has a strong background in media and advertising, which aligns well with Twitter's needs as a social media platform. 4. The conditional nature of the question: The question is conditional on Biden dropping out before July 20, 2023. This condition doesn't directly impact Twitter's leadership, but it could create a more volatile political and economic environment. 5. Time frame: The question asks about Yaccarino's position on July 1, 2024, which is about 13 months from her appointment. This is a significant amount of time for a CEO to establish themselves or face challenges. 6. Twitter's volatility: The platform has been through significant changes and challenges, which could potentially continue. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Linda Yaccarino will remain CEO of Twitter on July 1, 2024, even if Biden drops out of the race. Here's why: 1. Her recent appointment suggests a long-term commitment from both Yaccarino and Twitter. 2. Her expertise aligns well with Twitter's needs, increasing the likelihood of her success in the role. 3. The condition of Biden dropping out, while potentially disruptive to the political landscape, is unlikely to directly impact Twitter's leadership structure. 4. 13 months is a reasonable amount of time for a CEO to establish themselves, but not so long that major unforeseen changes are highly likely. However, there are factors that reduce the certainty: 1. Twitter's recent history of volatility and rapid changes. 2. The potential for unforeseen circumstances or performance issues. 3. The possibility that Elon Musk, as the owner, might decide to make unexpected changes.

However, they could potentially have indirect effects on the economy. 2. Economic indicator: The question asks about the US Core CPI (Consumer Price Index) increase for July 2024 compared to June 2024. 3. Historical context: Core CPI typically increases by small amounts month-over-month. A 0.1% increase is considered relatively low, and exceeding this threshold is common. 4. Potential impacts of the conditional events: a) Biden dropping out could create political uncertainty, potentially affecting markets and consumer behavior. b) Yaccarino as Twitter CEO is less likely to have a significant impact on overall inflation. 5. Long-term economic trends: By July 2024, we'll be over a year from now, and current inflationary pressures may have subsided. However, predicting economic indicators this far in the future is highly uncertain. 6.

Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that the Core CPI will increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024, even considering the conditional events. The political uncertainty from Biden dropping out could potentially lead to increased economic volatility, which might contribute to inflationary pressures.

While there have been concerns about his age and health, there's no strong indication that he plans to drop out. The probability of this happening is very low, perhaps around 5%.

Ohio's political landscape: Ohio has been trending more Republican in recent years, particularly in rural and working-class areas, which make up a significant portion of the 6th district. 6. National political climate: The unusual situation at the top of the ticket could potentially influence voter turnout and party loyalty in down-ballot races. Given these factors, here's my analysis: While the unusual situation with two Republican presidential nominees would likely cause some confusion and potentially depress Republican turnout, the 6th district of Ohio has been reliably Republican for many years. The district's voting history and demographic makeup suggest a strong Republican lean that would be difficult to overcome, even in unusual circumstances. However, the unprecedented nature of having two Republican nominees could lead to some unpredictability. It might cause some Republican voters to stay home out of confusion or frustration, potentially giving Democrats a slight opening. Despite this, the strong Republican history of the district, combined with Ohio's recent rightward shift, suggests that the Republicans would still have a significant advantage in retaining this seat. The unusual situation at the top of the ticket might narrow the margin of victory, but it's unlikely to completely flip such a historically Republican district."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "d27d99b6-c867-49bf-89e1-2df9b80036a5", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Both Will Hurd and Vivek Ramaswamy are selected as the Republican nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election (b) The Republican Party retains Ohio's 6th congressional district in the 2024 special election?", "body": "This question will resolve as Yes if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Both Will Hurd and Vivek Ramaswamy are selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are currently leading in polls and fundraising. c) It's unprecedented for a party to nominate two candidates for the same position in a general election. d) Will Hurd has been critical of Trump, which may not align with the current Republican base. The probability of this happening is close to zero, perhaps 0.001 or less. 2.

The outcomes of these legal issues could significantly impact his ability to secure the nomination. 5.

The strength of these candidates could affect Trump's chances. 6. Public opinion and party support: Trump's popularity among Republican voters and the party establishment's stance towards him will play a crucial role in determining whether he secures the nomination. Given these factors, I believe that Trump has a good chance of securing the Republican nomination, but it's far from certain. The legal challenges he faces pose the most significant threat to his candidacy. However, his strong base of support within the party and his previous success in securing the nomination work in his favor.

Let's analyze each part separately: 1. Kimberly Cheatle no longer being the director of the U.S. Secret Service before October 12, 2024: Cheatle was appointed in August 2022, and Secret Service directors typically serve for several years. However, leadership changes can occur due to various reasons, including political shifts or personal decisions. Given that the timeframe extends to October 2024, which is after the next presidential election, there's a moderate chance of a change in leadership. I'd estimate this at about 40% likelihood. 2. At least 30% of Manifold respondents agreeing that weak AGI had been achieved before July 23, 2024: The trend shown in the previous polls indicates increasing belief in AGI progress (15% in May, 27% in June). If this trend continues, it's quite possible that 30% could be reached by July 2024. However, AGI is a complex and debated topic, and progress might slow down or plateau. Given the current trajectory, I'd estimate this at about 60% likelihood. 3. Donald Trump being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Despite legal challenges, Trump remains a popular figure in the Republican Party and has a strong base of support. He's currently the frontrunner for the nomination. However, there are still potential obstacles, including legal issues and competition from other candidates.

Time frame: The market has about 14 days (from July 1 to July 15) to gain these 78 traders. 3. Growth rate: We need to estimate how quickly the market is likely to attract new traders. Without specific data on the market's past growth, we can make some assumptions: - If it gained 299 traders in a short period (say, a week), then gaining 78 more in two weeks seems very achievable. - If it took months to reach 299 traders, then 78 in two weeks might be more challenging. 4. Market visibility: The fact that this question exists might create a self-fulfilling prophecy effect, potentially driving more attention to the original market. 5. Topic interest: The embedded market is about predicting its own number of traders, which is a meta-topic that often attracts interest in prediction market communities. 6. Platform dynamics: Manifold Markets is a popular prediction market platform, which could help in attracting traders. 7. Potential for viral growth: If the market gains traction, it could spread quickly within the prediction market community. Given these factors, I believe there's a good chance the market will reach 377 traders. The meta nature of the market, the potential attention from this question, and the relatively modest number of additional traders needed (about 5-6 per day on average) all work in favor of reaching the goal. However, there's still uncertainty. We don't know the exact current growth rate or how much additional attention this market will receive.

Many factors can influence the outcome, including player performance, injuries, and competition from other top teams.

Historical performance: The BSE SENSEX has shown strong growth over the past decades. In the last 5 years (2018-2023), it has grown from around 35,000 to 60,000, which is about a 71% increase or roughly 11-12% annual growth. 3. Economic factors: India's economy is expected to continue growing, with the IMF projecting 6.1% GDP growth for 2023. This could support stock market growth. 4.

Tokyo 2020 results: In the most recent Summer Olympics (Tokyo 2020, held in 2021), the USA won 39 Gold medals and 41 Silver medals.

Given these factors, here's my analysis: The conditions (US Olympic performance and Trump's nomination) don't directly impact the military situation in Ukraine. However, Trump's nomination could indirectly affect US support for Ukraine, potentially emboldening Russia. Chasiv Yar's proximity to the current frontline makes it vulnerable. Russian forces have been trying to advance in this area, and a year is a significant time in warfare. However, Ukrainian forces have shown strong resistance and have been receiving substantial Western support. The war has been characterized by slow progress, and a complete Russian takeover of Chasiv Yar by June 2024 would require a significant shift in the current dynamics.

Current political landscape: As of now (2023), Donald Trump is actively running for the 2024 Republican nomination and is considered the frontrunner. 3. Tucker Carlson's position: As of 2023, Tucker Carlson has not announced a presidential run. He left Fox News in April 2023, which could potentially free him to pursue political ambitions, but he has not indicated plans to do so. 4. Republican nomination process: The Republican nominee is chosen at the Republican National Convention, typically held in the summer before the election. By July 2024, the nominee would likely already be determined through primaries and caucuses. 5. Likelihood of a late change: It's extremely rare for a party to change its nominee so late in the process, especially if the presumptive nominee (likely Trump in this scenario) is polling well against the opponent. 6. Republican Party dynamics: While some Republicans have sought alternatives to Trump, he maintains strong support among the party base. A last-minute switch to Carlson would be highly unusual and potentially divisive. Given these factors, it's highly improbable that Tucker Carlson would be the Republican nominee in this scenario.

Political climate: A 2-3 point lead for Trump over Biden would be concerning for Democrats, but not necessarily catastrophic. It's a relatively small margin that could potentially be overcome. 2. Tucker Carlson as the Republican nominee: This is an unusual scenario, as Carlson is a controversial figure who has never held elected office. His nomination might actually energize the Democratic base and potentially make some moderate Republicans uncomfortable. 3. Timing: The scenario takes place very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August), which is a critical time for party unity. 4. Democratic Party dynamics: Pressuring a sitting president to drop out of the race would be an extraordinary and risky move, especially this close to the election. 5. Biden's resilience: Despite concerns about his age and effectiveness, Biden has shown resilience in the face of criticism and challenges within his party. 6. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for a party to abandon its incumbent president, even when facing potential electoral defeat. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that five Democratic House Members or Senators would publicly pressure Biden to drop out: 1. The poll margin is concerning but not dire enough to warrant such a drastic move. 2. Tucker Carlson's nomination might actually be seen as an opportunity for Democrats rather than a threat. 3.

Only if both of these events occur, we then consider whether Evghenia Gu\u021bul will travel to Russia between April 24 and June 1, 2024. First, let's assess the likelihood of the conditional events: 1. Biden being declared incapacitated: This is a very rare occurrence and would require extraordinary circumstances. While Biden's age and occasional gaffes have raised questions about his fitness, invoking the 25th Amendment is an extreme measure that seems highly unlikely. 2. Trump testifying at the hush money trial: While this is more plausible than the first condition, it's still uncertain. Trump has a history of trying to avoid testifying, and his legal team would likely attempt to prevent it. The probability of both these events occurring is extremely low, as they are independent events with low individual probabilities. Now, regarding the main question about Evghenia Gu\u021bul traveling to Russia: Gagauzia is an autonomous region within Moldova, and Moldova has had a complex relationship with Russia. However, given Gagauzia's pro-Russian stance, it's not uncommon for its officials to maintain ties with Russia. That said, the specific timeframe (April 24 to June 1, 2024) is quite narrow, which reduces the likelihood of the trip occurring in that exact period. Considering all these factors: 1. The extremely low probability of both conditional events occurring. 2. The narrow timeframe for the governor's potential trip to Russia. 3. The general plausibility of Gagauzian officials visiting Russia, but not necessarily within such a specific time frame. The overall probability of this complex set of events occurring is extremely low.

However, there are several factors that could lead to a female nominee: a) Biden's age and health: He would be 82 at the start of a second term, which has raised concerns about his ability to serve. b) Biden's popularity: His approval ratings have been relatively low, which could lead the party to seek an alternative. c) Potential female candidates: There are several prominent female Democrats who could be considered, including: - Kamala Harris (current Vice President) - Elizabeth Warren (Senator) - Amy Klobuchar (Senator) - Gretchen Whitmer (Governor of Michigan) d) Party dynamics: The Democratic Party has been pushing for more diversity in leadership roles. e) Reaction to Republican nomination: If Hutchinson (a lesser-known candidate) becomes the Republican nominee, Democrats might feel more confident in nominating a woman, believing they have a strong chance of winning regardless of their candidate's gender. f) Impact of the hypothetical terrorist attack: Such an event could potentially shift focus towards national security issues, which might influence the selection of a candidate with strong foreign policy credentials. Despite these factors, Biden remains the most likely nominee as long as he chooses to run. The Democratic Party typically gives strong preference to incumbent presidents seeking re-election. Given all these considerations, I believe there is a significant chance of a female nominee, but it's not the most likely outcome."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "bedcd9e8-1228-4f5e-92e6-0c815b4aa852", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (1) A terrorist act occurs in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics, (2) Asa Hutchinson is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (3) the 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee is a Woman?", "body": "(1) A terrorist act occurs in metropolitan France during the 2024 Summer Olympics: The question will resolve as Yes if a terrorist attack in [Metropolitan France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_France) injures and/or kills at least one person, other than the terrorist(s), between, and inclusive of, the day of the Opening Ceremony (26 July 2024) and the day of the Closing Ceremony (11 August 2024).

Biden's age and health: At 80 years old, Biden is already the oldest serving president. By the 2024 election, he would be 82, which raises concerns about his ability to serve another full term. 3. Current statements: As of now, Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024, most recently in February 2023. 4.

The probability of multiple independent unlikely events all happening is the product of their individual probabilities, which results in an extremely low overall probability. The first two conditions alone (Biden stepping aside and Hutchinson winning the nomination) are so improbable that their joint occurrence would be extraordinarily rare. Adding the third condition (Harris becoming President) further reduces the likelihood to an almost negligible level. Given the extreme improbability of all these events occurring together, I would assign a very low probability to this scenario."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 5.2701740170224966e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 1.3175435042556241e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0027889780199225837, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Outcome: Biden announces he won't accept the nomination before July 15, 2024. This is the least likely part of the scenario. Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election, and it would take extraordinary circumstances for him to change course.

The pressure from party members would need to be intense and widespread, and the Anthropic report would need to contain extremely concerning information that somehow impacts Biden's decision.

Current market capitalization: As of now (2023), Apple's market cap is significantly larger than Nvidia's. Apple's market cap is around $2.7 trillion, while Nvidia's is around $1 trillion. This means Nvidia would need to grow substantially while Apple remains stagnant or declines for this to occur. 2. Growth potential: Nvidia is at the forefront of AI and GPU technology, which are rapidly growing sectors. The AI boom has already significantly boosted Nvidia's stock price and market cap in 2023. There's potential for continued growth as AI adoption increases. Apple, while still innovative, is in more mature markets (smartphones, computers, services). Its growth rate might be slower compared to Nvidia's. 3. Market trends: The tech sector, especially AI-related companies, has seen significant growth.

Historical precedent: The question mentions that Biden has done such interviews before, with the most recent qualifying interview being his appearance on The Howard Stern Show in April, which lasted about 70 minutes. 2. Time frame: We have approximately one year from now (July 2023) until the end of July 2024. This is a significant amount of time, increasing the likelihood of such an interview occurring. 3. Election cycle: The year leading up to July 2024 will be a crucial period in the presidential election cycle. As an incumbent president likely running for re-election, Biden may be more inclined to do longer, in-depth interviews to reach voters and address important issues. 4. Media strategy: While Biden has been known to be more cautious with media appearances compared to some of his predecessors, his team might see value in longer-form interviews to counteract any narratives about his age or mental acuity. 5. Potential venues: There are numerous potential venues for such an interview, including podcasts, late-night shows, and news programs like 60 Minutes (although the full interview would need to be released to qualify). 6. Past behavior: The question notes that many of Biden's recent interviews have been shorter than the required 45 minutes. This suggests a preference for briefer appearances, which could lower the probability. 7. Health and stamina considerations: Given Biden's age, there might be concerns about his ability to sustain a 45+ minute interview, which could make his team more hesitant to agree to such formats. Weighing these factors, I believe there is a good chance that Biden will participate in at least one qualifying interview before July 2024. The long time frame, the importance of media exposure during an election year, and the precedent set by his Howard Stern interview are significant factors in favor of this occurring.

To assess this, we need to consider: a) Historical trends: Core CPI typically increases by small amounts month-to-month. In recent years, monthly increases have often been around 0.2-0.4%, but they can vary. b) Federal Reserve policy: The Fed aims to keep inflation around 2% annually. By mid-2024, they may have achieved some success in moderating inflation. c) Economic conditions: The specific economic conditions in 2024 are uncertain, but assuming no major shocks, inflation might be more stable than in recent years (2021-2023). d) Seasonality: July doesn't typically see significant seasonal effects on Core CPI. e) Time frame: The prediction is for over a year in the future, which increases uncertainty. Given these factors, a Core CPI increase of more than 0.1% seems more likely than not. Even in periods of relatively low inflation, monthly increases often exceed 0.1%.

Recent appointment: Linda Yaccarino was appointed as Twitter's CEO in May 2023, which means she will have been in the role for just over a year by July 2024. This is a relatively short time for a CEO tenure, which could work in her favor as she may still be implementing her vision for the company. 2. Twitter's volatility: Twitter has experienced significant turbulence since Elon Musk's acquisition in 2022. The company has undergone major changes, layoffs, and shifts in strategy. This instability could potentially lead to more leadership changes. 3. Elon Musk's influence: As the owner of Twitter, Musk has shown a tendency to make sudden decisions and changes. His relationship with Yaccarino and satisfaction with her performance will be crucial factors in her longevity as CEO. 4. Yaccarino's background: She comes from a strong media and advertising background (former NBCUniversal advertising chief), which aligns with Twitter's need to improve its advertising revenue. If she can demonstrate success in this area, it could solidify her position. 5. Twitter's performance: The company's financial performance and user growth under Yaccarino's leadership will be critical. If Twitter shows improvement, it increases the likelihood of her remaining as CEO. 6. Tech industry trends: The tech industry, particularly social media, is known for rapid changes. Any major shifts in the industry could impact Twitter's strategy and potentially its leadership. 7. Time frame: The question asks about a date approximately 13 months from her appointment.

Considering these factors, I believe there's a moderate to good chance that Yaccarino will still be CEO on July 1, 2024.

Current political landscape: As of now (June 2023), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for 2024. He has announced his intention to run for re-election. 2. Glenn Youngkin's hypothetical nomination: The scenario assumes Youngkin becomes the Republican nominee. While Youngkin is a rising star in the GOP, he's not currently considered a frontrunner for the 2024 nomination. His selection would be somewhat unexpected. 3. Biden's age and health: Biden would be 81 at the start of a second term, making him the oldest president in US history. Health concerns could potentially lead to him dropping out, but there's no current indication of serious health issues. 4. Political strategy: If Youngkin were nominated, it might actually strengthen Biden's position. Youngkin is less polarizing than some other potential Republican nominees, which could make Biden seem like a safer choice for moderate voters. 5. Democratic Party dynamics: There's no clear successor to Biden within the Democratic Party. The party would likely prefer Biden to stay in the race unless there was a compelling reason for him to drop out. 6. Timing: July 20 is relatively close to the election. It would be unusual and potentially damaging for the Democratic Party if Biden were to drop out so late in the campaign. 7. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election race, especially this close to the election. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Biden to drop out, it seems highly unlikely. The scenario where Youngkin is nominated doesn't present any clear reason why Biden would be more likely to drop out.

US Presidential Election factors: - Glenn Youngkin as the Republican nominee: This is hypothetical and doesn't directly affect Venezuela's election. - Biden dropping out before July 20: Again, this is hypothetical and doesn't impact Venezuela's election process. 2. Venezuelan Presidential Election: - Scheduled for July 28, 2024 - The question asks if full results will be published before August 12, 2024 (about 15 days after the election) The key factor here is Venezuela's electoral process and transparency. Venezuela has faced criticism for its electoral processes in recent years, with concerns about fairness and transparency. However, the country does have an established electoral commission (Consejo Nacional Electoral or CNE). Historically, Venezuela has published election results relatively quickly, often within days of the election. For example: - In the 2018 presidential election, preliminary results were announced on the same day as the election. - In the 2021 regional elections, results were published within a few days. The requirement for results to be disaggregated to the parish level adds complexity, but this level of detail is typically part of Venezuela's electoral reporting process. Given that: 1. The hypothetical US election scenario doesn't directly impact Venezuela's election process. 2. Venezuela has a history of publishing results relatively quickly. 3. There's a 15-day window between the election and the resolution date. 4. The CNE typically provides detailed results, including parish-level data.

The likelihood of Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial. 2. The probability of Linda Yaccarino remaining CEO of Twitter until July 1, 2024. 3. The current political climate and potential shifts by July 2024. 4. The level of support for Joe Biden within the Democratic Party. 5. The precedent and implications of virtually nominating a candidate early. First, it's important to note that this is a conditional probability, assuming both Trump's testimony and Yaccarino's position as CEO are true. These conditions narrow our focus to the likelihood of Democratic opposition to Biden's early virtual nomination. As of now (May 2023), Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election, with generally strong support within the party. However, there are some concerns about his age and approval ratings. By July 2024, these concerns could potentially grow, especially if Biden's performance or polling numbers decline. The idea of virtually nominating a candidate early is unusual and could be seen as undemocratic by some party members. It might be perceived as an attempt to avoid potential challenges or debates, which could upset more progressive or reform-minded Democrats. However, getting 20 House/Senate Democrats to publicly oppose the party's strategy would be a significant break from party unity. Such actions are typically avoided, especially in an election year, as they can be seen as damaging to the party's chances. Moreover, by July 2024, the general election will be only a few months away. At this late stage, it's less likely that a large number of Democrats would risk undermining their party's candidate. Given these factors, while it's possible that some Democrats might privately oppose an early virtual nomination, it seems unlikely that 20 or more would publicly sign a letter against it. The risk of party disunity and potential negative impacts on the election would likely outweigh any benefits of opposing the strategy."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "8f61c12c-0744-4826-a874-ca94b456429f", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (1) Donald Trump testifies at the hush money trial, (2) Linda Yaccarino is CEO of Twitter on July 1, 2024, and (3) at least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if all of the following conditions are met: (1) [Credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) report Donald Trump has testified, whether in person or remotely, at the [trial](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/webcrim_attorney/Detail?which=case&docketNumber=q23XFOwZRDQ1d4LrNRdw2clqCMt/CzUoG/kRII/7Nmg=&countyId=K4i18rFVPQh5HTQ/kUoO3Q==&docketId=3Y4iKU5oHM75AtDme2cPhw==&docketDseq=T/O1YN_PLUS_BG65HkOeqEnpAkw==&defendantName=TRUMP,+DONALD&court=New+York+Supreme+Criminal+Court&courtType=U&recordType=U&recordNum=) concerning the so-called \"hush money\" payments to Stormy Daniels.

Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial: Trump has a history of avoiding testifying in legal proceedings, often citing constitutional protections. However, given the high-profile nature of this case and Trump's tendency to want to defend himself publicly, there's a possibility he might testify. Still, his lawyers would likely advise against it due to the risks involved. I'd estimate this has about a 40% chance of happening. 2. Linda Yaccarino being CEO of Twitter on July 1, 2024: Yaccarino was appointed as Twitter's CEO in May 2023. While the tech industry is known for rapid changes, and Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership has been particularly volatile, Yaccarino is an experienced executive. Barring any major controversies or personal decisions, it's quite likely she'll still be in the role by July 2024. I'd give this about an 80% chance. 3. At least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing early nomination of Biden: This is perhaps the most uncertain element. While there has been some discontent within the Democratic Party about Biden's age and performance, open opposition to his nomination would be a significant move. It would require a coordinated effort among a substantial number of lawmakers willing to go against the party leadership. Given the current political climate and the party's desire for unity against Republicans, this seems unlikely. I'd estimate this has about a 20% chance of occurring. For all three events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.40 * 0.80 * 0.20 = 0.064 or 6.4%.

The deadline given (July 15, 2024) is very close to the Democratic National Convention, making a last-minute change even more improbable. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at about 0.05. 3. Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics: Richardson is a talented sprinter, but winning an Olympic gold medal is extremely competitive. She missed the Tokyo Olympics due to a suspension and will face tough competition from other world-class sprinters. While she has a chance, it's far from certain. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at about 0.30. For all three events to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities: 0.85 * 0.05 * 0.30 = 0.01275.

The likelihood of Joe Biden having a qualifying interview before July 2024: Given that Biden has already done a 70-minute interview on The Howard Stern Show in April, it's quite likely he will do another long-form interview before July 2024. As the incumbent president running for re-election, he will likely want to maintain media presence and engage with voters. Therefore, the conditional part of this question is likely to be met. 2. The current state of the Republican primary race: As of now (2023), the Republican primary field is crowded, with several high-profile candidates including Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others. Mike Pence, while a former Vice President, is not currently considered a frontrunner in the race. 3. Mike Pence's position and chances: Pence has been struggling to gain traction in the Republican primary. He's polling significantly behind other candidates like Trump and DeSantis. His association with the Trump administration, combined with his actions on January 6th, 2021, have put him in a difficult position with both Trump supporters and Trump critics within the Republican party. 4. The likelihood of a surprise nomination: While not impossible, it's extremely rare for a party to nominate someone who isn't performing well in the primaries or who isn't a clear frontrunner. For Pence to become the nominee, it would likely require a major shake-up in the Republican field, such as multiple leading candidates dropping out or becoming ineligible. 5. Time frame: The Republican National Convention, where the nominee is officially selected, typically occurs in July or August of the election year. This gives ample time for the primary process to play out and for a clear frontrunner to emerge. Given these factors, while it's likely that Biden will have a qualifying interview, it seems highly improbable that Mike Pence will be the Republican nominee.

As an incumbent president, Biden might do such an interview, especially in the lead-up to the 2024 election.

As of 2023, they are the 5th largest group with 62 seats out of 705. The largest group, the European People's Party (EPP), has 176 seats. While there has been a rise in right-wing populism in Europe, it's unlikely that the ID group would gain enough seats to become the largest group. They would need to more than triple their current seat count, which is a massive leap. Moreover, the conditions specified (Biden's interview and Pence's nomination) are unlikely to significantly impact European Parliament elections. European voters are more influenced by local and EU-wide issues than by US politics. Given these factors, the probability of this scenario occurring is extremely low.

(a) A swimmer wins the most gold medals and Individual Neutral Athletes win 21 or more gold medals: 1. Swimmers winning the most gold medals is not uncommon in Olympic history. Michael Phelps, for instance, was the most decorated athlete in multiple Olympics. 2. However, predicting that a swimmer will win the most gold medals in 2024 is still uncertain, as there are many talented athletes in various sports. 3. The requirement for Individual Neutral Athletes to win 21 or more gold medals is quite high. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee (competing as neutral athletes) won 20 gold medals in total. 4. Achieving 21 or more gold medals would require an exceptional performance from the Individual Neutral Athletes, which is possible but not highly probable. (b) Russian athletes are barred from competing: 1. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to significant international sanctions against Russia, including in sports. 2. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be banned from international competitions. 3. However, the IOC has also suggested that they might allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutral individuals, without national symbols, flags, or anthems. 4. The final decision on Russian participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics has not been made yet, and there's ongoing debate about this issue. 5. The question states that for a \"Yes\" resolution, no more than 34 Russians can be competing, which allows for some flexibility.

Intentional shooting at Trump on July 13th, given he has testified: - Political violence against high-profile figures is rare but not unprecedented in the US. - Trump is a polarizing figure with both strong supporters and opponents. - He would likely have increased security after testifying in a high-profile trial. - July 13th is a specific date, which reduces the probability compared to a broader timeframe. - The condition of him having testified might slightly increase the risk due to heightened tensions. - Probability estimate: 0.01 (very unlikely, but not impossible) The overall probability is the product of these two probabilities, assuming they are independent events.

Universality places: The IOC provides opportunities for athletes from underrepresented countries to participate, potentially leading to surprise performances. Given these factors, it seems quite possible that 5 or more countries could win their first medal in Paris 2024. The historical data shows that 3-5 countries achieving this is not uncommon. With the introduction of breaking as a new sport and the continued development of Olympic programs worldwide, there's a good chance we'll see at least 5 countries reach this milestone. However, it's important to note that as more countries win their first medals over time, the pool of potential first-time winners naturally shrinks, making it slightly more challenging with each passing Olympics.

Joe Biden vs. Generic Democrat: The main focus here is on how Trump's polling numbers might differ when facing Biden specifically versus a generic Democrat. This comparison is more likely to have a meaningful impact on the results. 3. Current political landscape: As of early 2024, Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee. He has both advantages (incumbency, name recognition) and disadvantages (age concerns, mixed approval ratings) compared to a generic Democrat. 4. Trump's performance against Biden vs. Generic Democrat: Historically, incumbent presidents or well-known candidates like Biden often perform differently in polls compared to generic party representatives. However, a 3% difference is quite significant. 5.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Trump would gain at least 3% when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. While Biden may have some specific weaknesses that a generic Democrat wouldn't, he also has strengths and established support that might not be captured in a generic Democrat poll.

High-profile nature of the Olympics: Major international events like the Olympics are often seen as attractive targets for terrorist organizations due to their global visibility and symbolic importance. 3. Security measures: French authorities are likely to implement extensive security measures during the Olympics, which could deter potential attacks. 4. Conditional probabilities: The question is conditional on two seemingly unrelated events (new countries winning medals and Trump's poll performance). These conditions don't directly impact the likelihood of a terrorist attack, but they do narrow the scenario we're considering. 5.

Current global political climate: Geopolitical tensions and conflicts can influence the likelihood of terrorist activities, though this can change significantly by 2024. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate risk of a terrorist attack occurring during the specified time frame. The high-profile nature of the Olympics and France's history of being a target increase the risk. However, the short time frame and likely intense security measures mitigate this risk to some extent. The broad definition of what constitutes a terrorist attack in this context (including incidents that injure just one person) increases the probability somewhat, as smaller-scale incidents are more likely to occur than large-scale attacks.

However, established sporting nations tend to dominate most events. I'd estimate this at about 40% probability. (b) Trump gaining 3% against Biden in Manifold polls: This condition is highly dependent on current political dynamics and events that may occur between now and the polls.

However, the direction is uncertain: - It could increase Trump's lead as Democrats scramble to find a replacement. - It could decrease Trump's lead if a more popular Democrat steps in. 6. Narrow range: The question asks for a very specific range (>2 and \u22644), which is quite narrow given the potential for volatility. Given these factors, I believe the probability of this scenario occurring is low, but not negligible. Here's why: - The condition of Biden dropping out is itself unlikely, reducing the overall probability. - If Biden does drop out, the political landscape would be highly unpredictable. - The narrow time frame between a potential dropout and the polling date (July 15) means 538's average might not fully reflect the change. - The specific range (>2 and \u22644) is quite narrow, further reducing the likelihood. However, it's not impossible. If Biden were to drop out, there could be a brief period where Trump's lead expands as Democrats regroup, potentially falling into this range."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "4cc7c047-8151-427f-9088-35f7cfd73842", "title": "Given Biden drops out before July 20, 2024, and Trump's lead is between 2 and 4 on July 15, 2024, will Israel carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: (a) Biden drops out or is otherwise unable to continue the race before July 20, 2024, midnight Eastern Time, and (b) Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average as reported on the chart for the date of July 15, 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024.

The US election conditions (Biden dropping out and Trump's lead) are set for dates after the potential Israel-Iran conflict (July 2024 vs. May 2024). This means these conditions don't directly influence the likelihood of the attack. 3. However, the mere existence of this question suggests there might be some perceived connection between US politics and Israel-Iran tensions. 4. Israel and Iran have a long history of tensions and covert operations against each other. Israel has conducted attacks on Iranian targets before, both within Iran and in other countries. 5. The threshold for the attack is relatively low - at least five deaths from an attack attributed to Israel within Iran's borders. 6. The time frame (from now until May 1, 2024) is relatively short, which reduces the likelihood of such an event occurring. 7. Current geopolitical tensions, including Iran's nuclear program and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, could potentially escalate. 8. However, both countries generally prefer covert operations and cyber attacks over overt military actions, which might not meet the 'deadly attack' criteria. 9. International pressure and potential consequences of such an attack might serve as a deterrent for Israel.

While there have been concerns about his age and health, he has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. - The specific polling requirement (Trump leading by 2-4 points) is a narrow range, making it less likely to occur even if Trump is leading. - The combination of these two events happening together further reduces the probability. 2. Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024: - While tensions between Israel and Iran are high, a direct attack by Israel on Iranian soil would be a significant escalation. - Such an attack would risk broader regional conflict and international condemnation. - However, covert operations or targeted assassinations have occurred in the past, so it's not entirely implausible. For the question to resolve YES, both of these unlikely scenarios must occur.

Night Shyamalan has a mixed box office history, but he's known for creating buzz around his films. His recent movies have had varying levels of success: - 'Old' (2021): $16.8 million opening - 'Glass' (2019): $40.3 million opening - 'Split' (2016): $40 million opening 2. Genre and appeal: 'Trap' is described as a psychological thriller, which is Shyamalan's forte. This genre typically has a dedicated audience but may not always reach blockbuster levels. 3. Marketing and distribution: Universal Pictures is distributing the film, which suggests a potentially strong marketing push. However, without specific details about the marketing strategy, it's hard to gauge its impact. 4. Release date: The film is set to release on August 2, 2024. Late summer can be a good time for thriller releases, as it's after the major summer blockbusters but before the fall season. 5. Competition: Without knowing other major releases around the same time, it's difficult to assess the competition factor. 6. Star power: The cast includes Josh Hartnett, but full details aren't available. Shyamalan's name itself carries some star power. 7. Budget: The budget for 'Trap' isn't publicly known yet, which could affect the scale of production and marketing. 8. Post-pandemic box office trends: By 2024, the box office should have largely recovered from pandemic effects, but audience behaviors may have changed. 9. Inflation: By 2024, ticket prices may have increased, making it slightly easier to reach higher gross numbers. Considering these factors, especially Shyamalan's recent track record and the typical performance of psychological thrillers, I believe 'Trap' has a decent chance of grossing over $20 million in its opening weekend.

He served as president from 2005 to 2013 but was barred from running in 2017. The Guardian Council has been known to disqualify candidates they deem unsuitable. Given Ahmadinejad's past conflicts with the establishment, it seems unlikely that he would be approved. Probability: ~10% 2. Democratic pressure on Biden to drop out: While there has been some discussion about Biden's age and fitness for office, there hasn't been a significant movement within the Democratic Party to push him out. For five named Democratic lawmakers to publicly pressure Biden to drop out would be a major political event. This seems highly unlikely, especially given the potential damage to party unity. Probability: ~5% 3. Iranian military action against Israel: Tensions between Iran and Israel are high, but direct military confrontation has been rare. Iran typically acts through proxies. A direct attack would be a significant escalation and potentially trigger a larger conflict. While not impossible, it's improbable that Iran would take such a risky action in this specific timeframe.

High-profile nature of the event: The Olympics are a major international event that attracts global attention, making it a potential target for terrorist organizations seeking publicity. 3. Security measures: French authorities are likely to implement extensive security measures during the Olympics, which may deter potential attacks. However, the scale of the event also presents challenges in maintaining comprehensive security. 4. Current global terrorism trends: While there has been a decrease in large-scale terrorist attacks in Western Europe in recent years, the threat remains present. 5.

Considering these factors, while the French authorities will undoubtedly implement stringent security measures, the high-profile nature of the event, combined with France's history of terrorist incidents and the persistent threat of terrorism globally, suggests that there is a non-negligible risk of an attack occurring.

Competition within the Republican party: There are several other high-profile candidates (both announced and potential) who have more name recognition and political experience than Ramaswamy, such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others. 6. Timing of the hypothetical attack and the Republican National Convention: The 2024 Olympics are scheduled for July 26 to August 11, 2024. The Republican National Convention typically occurs in July or August.

Kimberly Cheatle's resignation: Assuming both conditions are met, we need to consider whether these events would lead to Cheatle's resignation or removal. There are several factors to consider: a) The terrorist attack in France would not directly impact U.S. Secret Service operations, as it's outside their jurisdiction. b) Ramaswamy's nomination wouldn't typically cause a change in Secret Service leadership, as the agency is meant to be non-partisan. c) The Secret Service's primary role in presidential elections is to provide protection for candidates, not to influence the political process. d) Cheatle was appointed in 2022, so she would still be relatively new in her role by 2024.

Existing indictment: Trump has already been indicted in Georgia on racketeering and other charges related to attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. This shows that prosecutors are willing to pursue charges against him. 2. Ongoing investigation: The Georgia case is still active, and investigators may uncover new evidence or witness testimony that could lead to additional charges. 3. Trump's past behavior: Trump has a history of making public statements that could be construed as attempts to influence witnesses or the legal process. For example, his social media posts and public comments about potential witnesses in other cases have raised concerns about witness tampering. 4. Time frame: The question gives a deadline of June 1, 2024, which is about 9 months from now. This provides a significant amount of time for new evidence to emerge or for prosecutors to build a case for witness tampering. 5. Legal scrutiny: Given the high-profile nature of the case and Trump's status as a former president and current presidential candidate, any potential witness tampering would likely be closely scrutinized by prosecutors. 6. Precedent: In other cases involving Trump, such as the federal case related to classified documents, concerns about witness tampering have been raised. This suggests that prosecutors are attuned to this possibility. However, there are also factors that reduce the likelihood: 1. Burden of proof: Prosecutors would need clear evidence of witness tampering to bring charges, which may be challenging to obtain or prove beyond a reasonable doubt. 2. Political considerations: Given Trump's status as a presidential candidate, there might be hesitation to bring additional charges without overwhelming evidence. 3. Existing charges: Prosecutors might feel that the current charges are sufficient and may not want to complicate the case further. 4. Legal strategy: Trump's legal team is likely advising him to be cautious in his public statements to avoid additional legal jeopardy. Considering these factors, I believe there is a significant possibility of witness tampering charges being brought, but it's not highly likely. The existing indictment and ongoing investigation provide a foundation for potential additional charges, and Trump's past behavior suggests he might engage in actions that could be construed as witness tampering.

Current political landscape: As of now (2023), Donald Trump remains a prominent figure in the Republican Party and has announced his intention to run for president in 2024. 2. Trump's popularity: Despite controversies, Trump maintains a strong base of support within the Republican Party. He has consistently polled as a frontrunner for the 2024 nomination. 3. Other Trump family members: While Donald Trump is the most likely family member to be nominated, other family members have shown political ambitions. However, their chances are significantly lower than Donald Trump's. 4. Potential challengers: Several other Republicans, such as Ron DeSantis, have emerged as potential challengers for the nomination. Their presence could split the non-Trump vote, potentially benefiting Trump. 5. Legal issues: Trump is facing several legal challenges, which could potentially impact his candidacy. However, these issues have not significantly diminished his support among Republicans so far. 6.

Historical precedent: It's rare for a former president to seek re-nomination, but not unprecedented (e.g., Grover Cleveland). Given these factors, Donald Trump appears to be the most likely nominee among the Trump family members, with other family members having a much lower chance. While there are potential obstacles and strong challengers, Trump's base of support and name recognition give him a significant advantage.

The state of the movie industry: Post-pandemic, the box office has been recovering, but it's not consistently at pre-pandemic levels for all films. 3. The genre and appeal of 'Trap': While details are limited, Shyamalan's films often have a thriller/horror element that can attract a specific audience. 4.

Given Shyamalan's recent track record, 'Trap' has a decent chance of grossing over $20 million in its opening weekend. His last film, 'Old,' opened at $16.8 million, which is close to the $20 million mark. Considering potential improvements in the movie industry's recovery and Shyamalan's name recognition, it's reasonable to think 'Trap' could perform slightly better. However, there are uncertainties. We don't know the exact nature of the film, its budget, marketing strategy, or release date. The political climate (with a Trump nominee) could either distract from entertainment news or drive people to seek escapism through movies.

The linked market getting 377 traders by July 15 AND a Trump family member being the Republican nominee: For the first part, as of now, we don't have information about the current number of traders in the linked market or its growth rate. Without this data, it's difficult to estimate the likelihood of reaching 377 traders. However, given that it's a specific market on Manifold, reaching 377 traders by July 15 seems achievable but not certain. For the second part, Donald Trump is currently the front-runner for the Republican nomination. While there are other candidates, Trump's popularity among Republican voters makes him the most likely nominee. The probability of another Trump family member being nominated is extremely low. Combining these, I'd estimate the probability of this first condition being met at around 0.6. 2. M. Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' grossing >$20 million in its domestic opening weekend: M. Night Shyamalan has a track record of successful opening weekends. His previous film 'Old' opened at $16.8 million, and his films often generate significant interest. However, 'Trap' would need to perform better than 'Old' to meet this condition.

As of September 2023, there have been discussions and some legal attempts to use the 14th Amendment to bar Trump from running, but no successful implementations. For this to happen by July 15, 2024: a) Legal challenges would need to be filed and succeed in at least one state. b) The state would need to officially remove Trump from the ballot. c) This decision would need to withstand immediate legal challenges. While there's growing discussion about using the 14th Amendment, actually implementing it faces significant hurdles: - It's unprecedented in modern times. - It would likely face immediate and strong legal challenges. - The Supreme Court would probably need to weigh in, which could take time. - There's no clear consensus on whether it applies to the presidency or how it should be enforced. Given these factors, while it's not impossible, it seems unlikely that Trump would be successfully removed from all primary ballots by the specified date. The legal and political barriers are substantial, and the timeline is relatively short. However, the question only requires Trump to be removed from one state's ballot, which lowers the bar significantly. It's conceivable that a single state might attempt this and temporarily succeed, even if it's later overturned. Considering all these factors, I believe it's unlikely but not impossible that Trump could be blocked from at least one primary ballot by July 15, 2024."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "d67ce9cd-3eca-4e27-94fb-37671e091f46", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) The Indiana Pacers win the 2024 NBA Finals (b) ISS advises Tesla shareholders against Elon Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election (c) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if all of the following conditions are met: \n\n(a) The Indiana Pacers are crowned the champion of the 2024 NBA Finals, according to [the NBA](https://www.nba.com/).\n\n(b) Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) releases a statement explicitly advising Tesla shareholders to vote *against* either Elon Musk's $57 billion pay package at the 2024 Tesla shareholder meeting OR the re-election of Kimbal Musk to the Tesla board of directors.\n\n(c) On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office (President, Senate, House of Representatives) under the grounds of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

Current market capitalization: As of June 2023, Apple's market cap is around $2.8 trillion, while Nvidia's is around $1 trillion. This means Nvidia would need to nearly triple its market cap while Apple's remains stable, or Nvidia would need to grow significantly while Apple declines. 2. Recent performance and trends: Nvidia has been experiencing rapid growth due to the AI boom and increased demand for its GPUs. Its stock price has more than doubled in 2023 alone. Apple, while still strong, has seen more modest growth. 3. Future outlook: Nvidia is well-positioned in the AI and machine learning markets, which are expected to continue growing. Apple, while a stable and profitable company, may face challenges in finding new growth avenues as the smartphone market saturates. 4. Time frame: The question asks about July 17, 2024, which is about 13 months from now. This is a relatively short time for such a significant market cap shift, but not impossible given recent tech market volatility. 5. Market conditions: The overall market conditions, potential economic changes, and unforeseen events could significantly impact both companies' valuations. 6. Competition and innovation: Both companies face competition and need to continue innovating. Any major breakthroughs or setbacks could affect their market caps. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Nvidia to overtake Apple in market cap by July 2024, it would require an extraordinary continuation of Nvidia's growth trajectory and possibly some decline in Apple's valuation.

While Nvidia has been growing rapidly due to the AI boom, overtaking Apple would require substantial growth or a significant decline in Apple's value. 2. OpenAI's current stance: As of now, OpenAI has not formally committed to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle. They have expressed support for open dialogue but haven't made a specific commitment to this principle. 3. Time frame: The commitment needs to be made before July 1, 2024, which gives OpenAI about a year from now to make this commitment. 4. AI industry trends: The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and there's increasing pressure for transparency and responsible development. This could push companies like OpenAI to adopt more open policies. 5. Public perception: As AI becomes more prevalent, public concern about AI risks may increase, potentially pressuring companies to be more transparent about their development processes. 6. Competition: Other AI companies might adopt similar principles, which could pressure OpenAI to follow suit to maintain their reputation as a leader in responsible AI development. 7. Internal culture: OpenAI has historically positioned itself as being committed to beneficial AI, which aligns with the principle in question. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that OpenAI will commit to this principle before July 1, 2024. The increasing focus on AI safety and transparency in the industry makes it more likely that OpenAI will take this step.

Strategic importance: The bridge is crucial for Russia's logistics and symbolic for its control over Crimea. This makes it a high-value target for Ukraine. 4. Time frame: The window for the attack is relatively short (about two months), which reduces the probability of an attack occurring within this specific timeframe. 5.

However, it's unclear how this would directly impact the likelihood of an attack on the Crimean Bridge. 6. Ongoing conflict: The war between Russia and Ukraine is likely to continue into 2024, maintaining the possibility of such attacks. 7. Defensive measures: Russia has likely increased security and defensive measures around the bridge following previous attacks, potentially making future attacks more difficult. 8.

There are no indications of any plans to terminate this agreement prematurely. The probability of this occurring is very low, perhaps around 0.01. 2. Asa Hutchinson being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: As of now, Asa Hutchinson is a relatively minor candidate in the Republican field. While he has announced his intention to run, he faces stiff competition from more prominent figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others. Given his current polling numbers and name recognition, the probability of him securing the nomination is extremely low, perhaps around 0.005. 3. USA winning more Gold than Silver medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics: This is the most likely of the three conditions. The United States has consistently been a top performer at the Olympics, often winning more gold medals than any other country. In recent Summer Olympics, the US has typically won more gold medals than silver. For example, in Tokyo 2020, the US won 39 gold and 41 silver medals, which was close. Given their strong track record, the probability of the US winning more gold than silver medals is relatively high, perhaps around 0.7.

He finished second in 2022 and 2023, showing consistent top-level performance. 2. Age and peak performance: Poga\u010dar will be 25 years old during the 2024 Tour, which is typically within the prime age range for cyclists in grand tours. This suggests he should still be at or near his peak performance. 3. Team support: Poga\u010dar rides for UAE Team Emirates, which has shown strong support for him in previous Tours. The team's continued backing will be crucial for his success. 4. Competition: His main rivals are likely to include Jonas Vingegaard (who won in 2022 and 2023) and other top cyclists. The level of competition remains high, which could make winning more challenging. 5. Course design: The specific route of the 2024 Tour is not yet known, but Poga\u010dar has shown versatility in different terrains, which should work in his favor regardless of the course. 6. Injuries and form: As of now, there are no reported major injuries or setbacks for Poga\u010dar. His current form seems good, but a lot can change in the lead-up to the 2024 Tour. 7. Motivation: After two consecutive second-place finishes, Poga\u010dar is likely to be highly motivated to reclaim the top spot. Given these factors, Poga\u010dar has a strong chance of winning the 2024 Tour de France. He has proven his ability to win the event multiple times, is still in his prime, and has the support of a strong team.

Tadej Poga\u010dar winning the Tour de France 2024: Poga\u010dar is a highly talented cyclist who won the Tour de France in 2020 and 2021. He's young (born in 1998) and likely to be in his prime in 2024. However, he faces strong competition, particularly from Jonas Vingegaard, who beat him in 2022 and 2023. While Poga\u010dar has a good chance of winning, it's far from certain. 2. Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Joe Biden instead of a generic Democrat: This part is more speculative and depends on several factors: a) The perception of Joe Biden vs. a generic Democrat: Biden might be seen as a weaker candidate due to his age and mixed approval ratings, which could benefit Trump when compared to a generic Democrat. b) The timing of the polls: The polls close on July 6, 2024, which is before the Tour de France typically ends (usually late July). This means respondents won't know the Tour's outcome when answering, reducing any potential influence from Poga\u010dar's victory. c) The connection between Poga\u010dar's victory and Trump's polling: There's no obvious direct link between these events, so Poga\u010dar's win is unlikely to significantly impact Trump's polling numbers. d) The specific demographics of Manifold respondents: We don't have information about the typical Manifold user, but they're likely to be more politically engaged than the general population. e) The 3% threshold: This is a significant difference, especially considering we're comparing Trump against Biden and a generic Democrat, not two specific candidates. Given these factors, while it's possible Trump could perform better against Biden than a generic Democrat, a 3% difference is substantial.

There's no current public indication that the US government plans to end this agreement prematurely. The current agreement runs until 2024, with options to extend.

The political landscape of Ohio's 6th congressional district: Ohio's 6th district has been a Republican stronghold for years. Bill Johnson, a Republican, has held this seat since 2011. In the 2022 election, Johnson won with 67.4% of the vote, indicating strong Republican support in the district. 3. Historical voting patterns: The district has consistently voted Republican in recent elections, not just for the House seat but also in presidential elections. This suggests a deeply entrenched Republican voter base. 4. The nature of special elections: Special elections can sometimes be more unpredictable than regular elections due to potentially lower turnout and shorter campaign periods. However, in strongly partisan districts, the dominant party usually maintains its advantage. 5. The timing of the election: If the special election is held in 2024, it would coincide with a presidential election year, which typically increases voter turnout and often reinforces existing partisan leanings. 6. The conditional nature of the question: The question only applies if the Verisign agreement is terminated, which is itself an unlikely event. If this unlikely event occurs, it might signify broader political upheavals that could potentially affect voting patterns, but there's no clear link between the Verisign agreement and this specific congressional race. Given these factors, if the condition of ending the Verisign agreement is met (which is unlikely), the probability of a Republican win in this district remains high. The district's strong Republican leaning, consistent voting history, and the incumbent party advantage in special elections all point towards a likely Republican victory.

Albania qualifying for Eurovision 2024 Grand Final: Albania has qualified for the Grand Final 8 times out of 18 attempts since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004. This gives them a historical success rate of about 44%. However, recent performances and the quality of their entry will also play a role. Without specific information about their 2024 entry, we can estimate their chances at around 40-50%. 2. Olympic record for men's pole vault being broken: The current Olympic record is 6.03m, set by Thiago Braz in 2016. The world record is 6.22m, set by Armand Duplantis in 2023. Duplantis is likely to compete in 2024 and has consistently performed at an extremely high level. Given his dominance in the sport and the proximity of the Olympic record to heights he regularly achieves, there's a good chance (around 70-80%) that this record will be broken. 3. Same nation winning more than one women's team sport: This is perhaps the most challenging part to predict. The United States is typically strong in basketball (both 5x5 and 3x3) and could potentially win in other sports like volleyball or water polo. Other nations like the Netherlands (field hockey, football) or Australia (rugby sevens, basketball) could also achieve this. However, winning multiple team sports is still a significant challenge. We might estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30-40%. To resolve as YES, all three of these events must occur together.

Public opinion polls vs. Manifold respondents: The prompt mentions that public opinion polls show Biden losing to Trump, while other Democrats perform better.

Manifold is a prediction market platform, which may attract users who are more politically engaged and informed than the average voter.

By this time, voters will have had more exposure to both Biden and Trump, potentially solidifying their opinions. 3. Generic Democrat vs. Biden: Generally, a generic candidate tends to perform better than a specific candidate because people can project their ideal qualities onto the generic option. Biden, as a known quantity with a track record, may perform worse than a generic Democrat. 4. Trump's base vs. Biden's base: Trump has a loyal base that is likely to support him regardless of the opponent. Biden, on the other hand, may face some challenges in energizing the Democratic base, especially if his approval ratings remain low. 5. Margin required: The question asks if Trump will gain at least 3% when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat. This is a significant margin, especially considering that elections are often decided by smaller margins. 6.

The combination of Biden's potential weaknesses as a specific candidate, Trump's loyal base, and the characteristics of Manifold respondents make it plausible that this threshold will be met.

However, Biden has been facing some challenges in his presidency, which could potentially benefit Trump in a head-to-head comparison. The 3% threshold is not particularly high, so this condition seems plausible but not certain. 2. France placing in the Top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics: France has historically performed well in the Olympics, but not consistently in the top 5. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, France finished 8th in the medal table. However, host countries often see a boost in performance due to home advantage, increased funding, and motivation. France will likely aim to perform exceptionally well as the host nation in 2024. Looking at recent Olympic performances: - 2020 Tokyo: 8th place - 2016 Rio: 7th place - 2012 London: 7th place - 2008 Beijing: 10th place France has been close to the top 5 in recent Olympics, and with the home advantage in 2024, they have a good chance of breaking into the top 5.

Political factors: The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas could potentially impact Israel's participation or reception in the contest. However, Eurovision has a history of separating politics from the competition as much as possible. 6.

Trump's lead over Biden being between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024: This is a much more uncertain prediction. Several factors come into play: a) The 2024 election is still many months away, and polls can fluctuate significantly. b) As of the question creation date (November 2023), the election landscape is not fully formed. c) The specific range (3-4 points) is quite narrow, making it less likely to hit this exact range. d) Historical trends show that presidential races often tighten as election day approaches. e) External factors like economic conditions, international events, and candidate performance can greatly influence polls. Given these factors, hitting this exact range seems unlikely. If we assume Trump is leading (which is not certain), the probability of his lead falling in this specific 1-point range is relatively low. I would estimate this at around 10-15%. Combining these probabilities: The question only applies if Israel qualifies (80% chance), and then Trump needs to be leading by 3-4 points (let's say 12.5% chance). 80% * 12.5% = 10%.

The Secret Service's primary role is to protect political leaders, not to engage in party politics. 2. Tenure and performance: Kimberly Cheatle was appointed in August 2022.

Let's break it down: (a) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early: Given the context provided, there seems to be significant dissatisfaction among House Democrats regarding the early nomination plan. Rep. Jared Huffman is circulating a letter, and the article mentions 'scores of their own members remain deeply unsettled.' However, getting 20 signatures is still a substantial number. While it's possible, it's not guaranteed. I'd estimate this has about a 60% chance of happening. (b) The head of the Secret Service resigning within the next 90 days: There's no specific information provided about Kimberly Cheatle's job performance or any controversies surrounding her position. Without any clear indications of potential resignation or dismissal, this seems unlikely. The Secret Service Director typically serves for several years unless there's a major issue. I'd estimate this has about a 10% chance of occurring. (c) The closing value of BSE SENSEX being greater than 75k and less than or equal to 77k on July 21, 2024: Predicting a specific stock market index value more than a year in advance is extremely difficult. The current BSE SENSEX value (as of July 2023) is around 65,000. For it to be in the specific range of 75,000-77,000 on a particular date is a very narrow target. While growth is possible, hitting this exact range is highly improbable. I'd estimate this has about a 5% chance of occurring. For all three events to occur together, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.60 * 0.10 * 0.05 = 0.003 or 0.3%.

Recent developments: There have been reports of increased Chinese presence and assertiveness in disputed waters, which has led to protests from the Philippines.

Diplomatic tensions between the Philippines and China: The condition of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between these two countries by August 1, 2024, is plausible given ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea. However, this event doesn't directly relate to Maria Corina Machado or Venezuela. 2. Joe Biden's hypothetical withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race: While this would be a significant political event in the US, it doesn't have a direct connection to Machado's situation in Venezuela. 3. Maria Corina Machado's current status: Machado is a prominent opposition leader in Venezuela who has faced political persecution. In June 2023, she was barred from holding public office for 15 years, which has been seen as an attempt to prevent her from running in the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election. 4. Venezuela's political climate: The country has a history of imprisoning opposition leaders, and the government led by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has been known to crack down on dissent. 5. International pressure: The US and other countries have been putting pressure on Venezuela to allow free and fair elections. The hypothetical scenario of Biden withdrawing might reduce this pressure, potentially emboldening the Maduro government. 6. Timing: The question asks about imprisonment by August 3, 2024, which is relatively close to the expected date of the Venezuelan presidential election (likely to be held in the second half of 2024). Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high probability that Machado could be imprisoned by the specified date. The Maduro government has shown a willingness to take action against opposition leaders, especially as elections approach. The reduced international pressure from a potential Biden withdrawal could create an environment where such actions face less global scrutiny. However, it's important to note that imprisoning Machado would likely lead to significant international backlash and could potentially harm Venezuela's attempts to improve relations with the US and other countries. This factor might discourage such a drastic action.

Current trend: The previous polls show an increasing trend in the percentage of respondents agreeing that weak AGI has been achieved. In May 2024, 15% agreed, and in June 2024, 27% agreed. This suggests a rapid increase in perception of AI capabilities. 2. Time frame: The question asks about the poll in July 2024, which is only one month after the June poll. This short timeframe limits the potential for dramatic advancements, but given the fast pace of AI development, significant progress is still possible. 3. Threshold: The question asks if at least 30% will agree. The June poll was already at 27%, so only a small increase is needed to reach 30%. 4. AI progress: The field of AI is advancing rapidly, with new models and capabilities being announced frequently. It's reasonable to expect continued progress in the coming month. 5. Public perception: As AI becomes more prevalent and capable in everyday applications, public perception of its abilities tends to increase, even if the underlying technology hasn't changed dramatically. 6. Definition ambiguity: The poll intentionally leaves the definition of 'weak AGI' open to interpretation. This ambiguity could lead to a higher percentage of positive responses as people apply their own, potentially less stringent, definitions. 7. Previous market underestimation: The question notes that previous markets significantly underestimated Manifold's belief in AI progress. This suggests that there might be a tendency for faster progress or higher agreement than initially expected. Given these factors, especially the current trend and the closeness to the 30% threshold, it seems quite likely that the July 2024 poll will reach or exceed 30% agreement. The rapid increase from May to June (12 percentage points) suggests that another 3 percentage point increase in a month is very plausible. However, we should also consider that progress might slow down or that public opinion might stabilize, preventing the percentage from reaching 30%.

If this occurs, it could have a substantial impact on financial markets, potentially driving them upwards due to increased optimism about technological progress and economic growth. 2. 'House of the Dragon' S2E7 rating: The condition of the episode being rated >8.5 on IMDB is less directly related to financial markets. However, it could be an indicator of positive consumer sentiment and engagement with entertainment, which might indirectly reflect a generally positive economic mood. 3. BSE SENSEX closing value: The question asks about a very specific range (75,000 to 76,000) for the BSE SENSEX on July 21, 2024. As of July 2023, the BSE SENSEX is around 65,000. To reach the 75,000-76,000 range by July 2024 would require significant growth, but it's not impossible given potential technological advancements and positive market sentiment. 4.

Given these factors, there are several considerations: - The weak AGI achievement could significantly boost market sentiment, potentially driving the SENSEX upwards. - The specific SENSEX range is narrow, making it less likely to hit exactly that range. - The 'House of the Dragon' rating, while positive, is likely to have minimal direct impact on the Indian stock market. - The time frame of about a year allows for significant market movements, but also increases uncertainty.

Let's analyze each condition separately: 1. AGI consensus: The trend of increasing agreement on weak AGI achievement suggests this is possible. However, 30% is a significant threshold, and AGI progress can be unpredictable. Given the steady progress mentioned, I'd estimate a 40% chance of this condition being met. 2. \"House of the Dragon\" S2E7 rating: TV show ratings can be volatile, especially for individual episodes. An 8.5+ rating is quite high and challenging to achieve consistently. Without knowing the specific plot points or reception of previous episodes in season 2, this is difficult to predict accurately. Based on the show's previous popularity, I'd estimate a 30% chance of this condition being met. 3. BSE SENSEX closing value: Predicting a specific narrow range for a stock index a year in advance is extremely difficult. Many factors can influence the market in that time. The current BSE SENSEX value (as of July 2023) is around 65,000. To reach 75,000-76,000 would require significant growth, but it's not impossible given a year's time frame.

While Nvidia has been growing rapidly due to AI advancements, overtaking Apple in just over a year seems challenging. However, given Nvidia's momentum, I'd estimate a 30% chance of this occurring. b) Tyson Fury defeating Oleksandr Usyk: This fight is highly anticipated in the boxing world. Fury is considered one of the best heavyweights, but Usyk is also undefeated and highly skilled. Fury has a slight advantage in size and experience at heavyweight. I'd give Fury a 60% chance of winning. c) Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024: The war in Ukraine has been ongoing, and predicting territorial control is difficult. Chasiv Yar is strategically important, and Russia has been trying to advance in this area. However, Ukraine has been putting up strong resistance. Given the current situation and the time frame, I'd estimate a 40% chance of Russian control by the specified date.

Scotland holding an official independence referendum before May 3, 2024: - The Scottish National Party (SNP) has been pushing for a second independence referendum. - The UK government has consistently refused to grant permission for another referendum. - The short timeframe (less than two months from the start of Trump's trial to May 3, 2024) makes it highly unlikely for a referendum to be organized, even if suddenly approved. - The UK is currently facing other significant political challenges, making it improbable that they would suddenly change their stance on Scottish independence. - There are no current indications of plans for such a referendum in the immediate future. 3.

Kagurabachi's publication schedule: Kagurabachi is a relatively new manga series in Shonen Jump, having started in 2023. New series often have more frequent breaks to allow the author to build up a backlog of chapters. 3. Typical Shonen Jump practices: Shonen Jump usually announces breaks at the end of chapters, and it's common for series to have occasional breaks, especially after milestone chapters or before/after major story arcs. 4. Chapter 40 significance: Chapter 40 is not typically a major milestone number for manga series, but it could potentially mark the end of an arc or a significant plot point. 5.

The series is new enough that breaks are more likely, and chapter 40 could potentially be a good point for a break if it concludes an arc or leads into a new one.

The UK government has consistently opposed another Scottish independence referendum, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a referendum without Westminster's consent.

Cyprus qualifying for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final: Cyprus has a mixed record in Eurovision. They've qualified for the final in 7 out of the last 10 contests (2013-2023, excluding 2020 which was cancelled). This gives them a 70% historical success rate. However, they failed to qualify in 2023, which might impact their strategy and performance in 2024. Still, given their overall track record, I'd say they have a decent chance of qualifying. 2. Republican Party retaining Ohio's 6th congressional district in 2024 special election: Ohio's 6th district has been a Republican stronghold for years. In the 2022 election, the Republican candidate won with 67.9% of the vote. The district has consistently voted Republican in recent elections, and there's no strong indication of a significant shift in voter demographics or preferences.

In the 2016 Rio Olympics, 27 world records were broken. However, the number can vary significantly from one Olympics to another. Factors such as technological advancements in equipment, training methods, and the specific athletes competing can all influence this.

Incumbency advantage: Historically, sitting presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless faced with significant challenges or health issues. Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Current intentions: As of now (June 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He officially announced his campaign on April 25, 2023. 3. Age and health concerns: Biden is currently 80 years old and would be 82 at the start of a second term. This has raised concerns about his ability to serve effectively for another four years. However, he has maintained that he is fit for office. 4. Party support: Despite some concerns about his age, Biden still enjoys significant support from the Democratic Party establishment. There is no clear alternative candidate with broad party support. 5. Polling and approval ratings: While Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, they are not catastrophically bad. Recent polls show some improvement in his numbers. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely that a sitting president would wait until this late to announce they're not running. 7. Political landscape: The Republican field is still taking shape, and Biden may see himself as the strongest candidate to face potential Republican nominees. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he's not accepting the nomination. He has already launched his re-election campaign and would face significant political backlash if he were to reverse course so late in the process. The only scenarios where this might happen would be a severe health crisis or an unforeseen political scandal, both of which are relatively low probability events."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "190f3269-d825-4bb7-8c8c-ee16fc44faa1", "title": "If Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination, will OpenAI commit to \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" before July 1, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Before 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement that he will not seek and will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President for another term in the 2024 cycle.

Let's analyze each part: 1. Biden's announcement: The likelihood of Biden not running for re-election seems low at this point. He has repeatedly stated his intention to run, and his campaign is already underway. While there's always a possibility of unforeseen circumstances (health issues, family concerns, etc.), it's unlikely he would drop out so close to the election. 2. OpenAI's commitment: OpenAI has shown some commitment to responsible AI development and transparency. However, making a new, stronger commitment specifically to 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' in such a short timeframe (before July 1, 2024) is not highly likely. This kind of policy change usually requires careful consideration and may not be a top priority for the company. Moreover, the condition that a member of righttowarn.ai must be satisfied with the commitment adds another layer of uncertainty.

BSE SENSEX prediction: Predicting stock market indices months in advance is extremely challenging due to numerous factors that can influence the market. These include global economic conditions, geopolitical events, domestic policies, and company performances. 3. Correlation between the two events: There is likely no direct causal relationship between Kalenjin athletes winning Olympic marathons and the BSE SENSEX closing value. These events are essentially independent. 4. Current BSE SENSEX trends: As of April 2023, the BSE SENSEX is around 60,000.

Timing: The Olympic marathons typically occur near the end of the Games, which are scheduled for July 26 to August 11, 2024.

French political landscape: As of April 2023, the current Prime Minister of France is \u00c9lisabeth Borne, who belongs to the 'Together' (Ensemble) coalition. The next French legislative elections are scheduled for 2027, which means that barring any unforeseen circumstances, the current government is likely to remain in power until then. 3. Potential political changes: While it's unlikely for a major shift in the French government to occur before July 2024, it's not impossible. Factors that could lead to a change include: - A motion of no confidence in the current government - A resignation of the current Prime Minister - A decision by President Macron to reshuffle the government 4. Alternative coalitions: If a change were to occur, it's more likely that the new Prime Minister would still come from the 'Together' coalition, as it currently holds a relative majority in the National Assembly. The probability of a Prime Minister from a different coalition is low. 5. Conditional nature of the question: The question is conditional on Luxembourg qualifying for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, which is itself an unlikely event. This condition adds an extra layer of uncertainty to the prediction. Given these factors, I believe it's highly unlikely that the Prime Minister of France will belong to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024, even if Luxembourg qualifies for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

The USA has a strong basketball program and has historically performed well in the Olympics, but competition is increasing.

Now, assuming these conditions are met, we need to consider the likelihood of OpenAI making the specified commitment. OpenAI has shown interest in AI safety and ethics, but making a formal commitment to 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' is a significant step. The AI industry is competitive, and companies might be hesitant to make such commitments due to potential risks to their intellectual property or competitive advantage. However, public pressure and the growing concern about AI risks could push companies like OpenAI to make such commitments. The specific conditions (Olympic results) don't seem directly related to OpenAI's decision-making process, so we should consider this part independently. Given the current climate of AI development and increasing calls for responsible AI practices, there's a moderate chance that OpenAI might make such a commitment in the next year, regardless of Olympic results.

M. Night Shyamalan's track record: Shyamalan has had a mixed reception for his films in recent years. His last three films had Rotten Tomatoes scores of 67%, 50%, and 37%. This shows a wide range of critical reception, with only one of the three reaching the 'Fresh' threshold of 60%. 2. Trend in Shyamalan's recent work: His most recent film, 'Knock at the Cabin,' received a 67% score, which is an improvement over his previous two films. This could indicate an upward trend in the quality of his work or at least in its critical reception. 3. Nature of 'Trap': While we don't have specific details about the plot or genre of 'Trap,' Shyamalan is known for his twist endings and psychological thrillers. The success of the film will likely depend on how well he executes these elements and whether they resonate with critics. 4. Critical expectations: Critics are often aware of a director's past work and may have certain expectations. Given Shyamalan's reputation and recent improvement, there might be cautious optimism about 'Trap.' 5. Time for critical consensus: The question asks about the score one week after release, which is usually enough time for a significant number of reviews to be collected and for a consensus to form. 6. Conditional nature of the question: The condition about the Netherlands qualifying for Eurovision doesn't seem to have any direct relation to the film's critical reception, so we can treat this as an independent event. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that 'Trap' will achieve a score of at least 60% on Rotten Tomatoes. The recent upward trend in Shyamalan's work is encouraging, but his overall inconsistent track record makes it far from certain. The 67% score for 'Knock at the Cabin' suggests that critics are still open to praising his work when they feel it deserves it.

The .com TLD agreement: Verisign has been managing the .com TLD since 1995, and the agreement with the US Department of Commerce has been in place for a long time.

They even won in 2019. This suggests a high probability of qualification, around 90%. 2. M. Night Shyamalan's \"Trap\" (2024) having a Rotten Tomatoes score of at least 60%: Shyamalan's recent films have had mixed critical reception. His last three films scored as follows on Rotten Tomatoes: - \"Old\" (2021): 50% - \"Glass\" (2019): 37% - \"Split\" (2016): 77% Given this track record, it's difficult to predict with certainty.

Nigel Farage's political career and current status: - Farage is a well-known British politician, former leader of UKIP and the Brexit Party. - He has run for MP multiple times but has never been successful in getting elected to the UK Parliament. - As of 2023, Farage is not actively leading a major political party in the UK. 3. UK political landscape: - The UK uses a first-past-the-post voting system, which can be challenging for smaller parties or independent candidates. - Farage's previous attempts to become an MP have failed, partly due to this system. 4. Time until the election: - The election is set for July 4, 2024, which is about a year away from the current date. - This gives Farage some time to potentially build a campaign, but it's a relatively short period for significant political shifts. 5.

Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Nigel Farage would be elected as an MP in the July 2024 UK General Election. His past failures to secure a seat, the challenges posed by the UK electoral system for non-major party candidates, and his current reduced involvement in active politics all suggest a low probability of success. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility. Farage remains a known figure in UK politics, and political landscapes can change rapidly.

An armed conflict between China and Taiwan resulting in at least one death before June 6, 2024. The first two conditions determine whether the question is applicable, while the third condition determines the actual outcome if the first two are met. Regarding the first condition, Sifan Hassan is a highly accomplished long-distance runner with multiple Olympic medals. Her winning a medal in 2024 is quite possible, but not guaranteed. The second condition, a terrorist attack during the Olympics, is unfortunately always a possibility given the high-profile nature of the event. However, France has extensive security measures in place for such events. The third condition, an armed conflict between China and Taiwan resulting in deaths before June 6, 2024, is the most critical part of this question. Several factors to consider: 1. Historical context: China-Taiwan tensions have been ongoing for decades, but have not resulted in direct armed conflict in recent years. 2. Current geopolitical situation: Tensions have been increasing, with China conducting military exercises near Taiwan. 3. International involvement: The US and other countries have shown support for Taiwan, which may deter China from initiating a conflict. 4. Timing: The question asks about a conflict before June 6, 2024, which is before the Olympics even begin. Given these factors, while tensions between China and Taiwan are high, an actual armed conflict resulting in deaths seems unlikely in the near future.

His more recent films have shown improvement, with 'Split' (2016) and 'Old' (2021) receiving Fresh ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. 2.

The conditions mentioned (hospitalization peak timing and Biden dropping out) seem unrelated to the film's quality or reception. These factors are likely irrelevant to the Rotten Tomatoes score. 4. Critical reception trends: In recent years, there has been a trend towards more favorable critical reception for genre films, especially those with unique premises or directorial visions. 5. Shyamalan's reputation for plot twists: While this has been both a strength and weakness in the past, critics have become more accustomed to expecting these twists, which could lead to a more balanced assessment of the film. 6. The cast: The film stars Josh Hartnett, who has been in critically acclaimed projects recently. A strong performance could positively influence critics' opinions. 7. Release timing: An August release date is typically not considered prime time for critically acclaimed films, which might slightly lower expectations. Given Shyamalan's recent upward trend in critical reception, the potential for the psychological thriller genre to resonate with critics, and the general trend of more favorable reviews for genre films, I believe there's a moderate chance that 'Trap' will receive a Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The main question: The likelihood of Renew holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections. Let's break it down: 1a. The linked market reaching 377 traders: Without access to the current number of traders or the market's growth rate, it's difficult to assess this condition. However, given that the deadline is more than a year away, it seems plausible that this condition could be met. 1b.

Renew holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections: Renew Europe is currently the third-largest group in the European Parliament, behind the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). As of 2023, the seat distribution is: - EPP: 176 seats - S&D: 144 seats - Renew: 101 seats For Renew to hold the most seats after the 2024 elections, they would need to gain a significant number of seats while the EPP and S&D lose seats. This is a substantial shift in the political landscape. Several factors make this unlikely: - Historical trends: The EPP and S&D have consistently been the two largest groups in the European Parliament for decades. - Current polling: Most projections do not show Renew overtaking both the EPP and S&D. - Political landscape: While there has been some growth in liberal and centrist parties across Europe, it's not enough to suggest a complete overhaul of the parliament's composition. However, there are some factors that could potentially work in Renew's favor: - Increasing dissatisfaction with traditional center-right and center-left parties in some countries. - The potential for a strong performance by Emmanuel Macron's party in France, which is part of Renew. - Possible realignments or new alliances forming after the election.

The linked market reaching 377 traders by July 15, 2024: - The market currently has 40 traders (as of April 2023). - There's over a year for it to reach 377 traders. - However, the market is quite niche and may not attract a large number of traders. - I estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. 1b. Croatia qualifying for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024: - Croatia has qualified for the Grand Final 6 times out of 12 attempts since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004. - Their qualification rate is 50%, which we can use as a baseline. - Recent performances and any changes in their selection process could affect this, but without specific information, we'll stick close to the historical average. - I estimate the probability of this occurring at around 50%. 2. Renew holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections: - Renew is currently the third-largest group in the European Parliament. - They would need to significantly increase their seat count to overtake the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). - Recent polls and political trends don't suggest a major shift towards Renew. - I estimate the probability of this occurring at around 10%. To resolve YES, all three of these events must occur together. We can calculate this by multiplying the individual probabilities: 0.30 * 0.50 * 0.10 = 0.015 or 1.5%.

Historical context: Iran and Israel have a long-standing adversarial relationship, with Iran frequently threatening Israel's existence and supporting proxy groups that engage in conflicts with Israel. 2. Recent tensions: The ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, particularly the Israel-Hamas war that began in October 2023, have significantly escalated tensions in the region. Iran has been vocal in its support for Hamas and other anti-Israel groups. 3. Iran's capabilities: Iran has demonstrated its ability to carry out or support attacks in the region through various means, including missile strikes, drone attacks, and support for proxy groups. 4. Israel's defense capabilities: Israel has a highly advanced defense system and intelligence network, which makes it challenging for Iran to carry out direct attacks on Israeli soil. 5. International pressure: The international community, particularly the United States, has been working to prevent further escalation in the region, which might deter Iran from direct action against Israel. 6. Time frame: The question gives a period of about 6 months from the creation date to the resolution date, which is a significant amount of time for tensions to potentially escalate or for an attack to be planned and executed. 7. Threshold for resolution: The question specifies that at least five individuals must die for it to resolve as Yes, which is a relatively low threshold for a state-sponsored attack. Given these factors, there is a significant possibility of Iran carrying out or supporting an attack within Israel that results in at least five deaths. The ongoing regional tensions, Iran's capabilities, and the relatively long time frame increase the likelihood. However, Israel's strong defenses and international diplomatic efforts serve as counterbalancing factors. Considering all these aspects, I believe there is a moderate to high probability of this event occurring, but it's not a certainty."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "cea9ad0d-0d23-4892-af27-2066bb78cb74", "title": "Given Iran carries out a deadly attack within Israel before May 1, 2024, will there be an armed forces conflict death between China and Taiwan in 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: After the publication of this question and before May 1, 2024, credible reports indicate that an attack attributed to Iran and occurring within Israel's borders has led to the death of at least five individuals.

The hypothetical scenario: An Iranian attack on Israel causing at least five deaths before May 1, 2024. 2. The potential for escalation between China and Taiwan in response to this event. 3. The historical context of China-Taiwan relations and recent tensions. 4. The global geopolitical climate and potential for conflict spillover. First, it's important to note that an Iranian attack on Israel would likely cause significant regional tension and potentially global repercussions. However, the direct link between such an event and a China-Taiwan conflict is not immediately apparent. China and Taiwan have a long-standing dispute, with China claiming Taiwan as part of its territory and Taiwan maintaining de facto independence. Tensions have been high in recent years, with increased military activities in the Taiwan Strait. While an attack by Iran on Israel could potentially destabilize the global geopolitical situation, it's not likely to be a direct trigger for armed conflict between China and Taiwan. China typically acts based on its own strategic interests and timeline regarding Taiwan, rather than in response to events in the Middle East. However, we should consider the possibility of opportunistic action. If global attention and resources are focused on a potential conflict in the Middle East, China might see this as an opportunity to take action against Taiwan. Yet, this scenario seems unlikely for several reasons: 1. The international community, especially the United States, would likely still be capable of responding to multiple crises simultaneously. 2. China has generally preferred a long-term strategy of pressure and influence rather than direct military conflict with Taiwan. 3. The economic and diplomatic costs of initiating an armed conflict would be extremely high for China, especially in a time of global instability. Given these factors, while an armed conflict between China and Taiwan in 2024 is possible, it doesn't seem significantly more likely in the event of an Iranian attack on Israel. The probability of such a conflict occurring and resulting in at least one death among the armed forces of either side remains relatively low."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "967ee285-95c2-40c8-8e20-1eb08b81cfec", "title": "Given both an Iranian attack in Israel and a China-Taiwan armed conflict death, will the Oklahoma City Thunder win the 2024 NBA Finals?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: \n\n(a) Following the date of this question's publication and before May 1, 2024, credible reports indicate that an attack attributed to Iran and occurring within Israel's borders has led to the death of at least five individuals.\n\n(b) Before June 6th, 2024, credible reports confirm one or more deaths among the armed forces of China or Taiwan as a result of armed conflict between the two parties.\n\nThen, will the Oklahoma City Thunder be crowned the champion of the 2024 NBA Finals, according to [the NBA](https://www.nba.com/)?

NBA standings and team performance: As of the 2023-24 NBA season, the Oklahoma City Thunder is a young team with potential but not considered a top championship contender. They have talented players like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey, but they're still in a rebuilding phase. 3. Competition in the Western Conference: The Western Conference is highly competitive, with teams like the Denver Nuggets (reigning champions), Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, and Los Angeles Lakers having more established rosters and recent playoff success. 4. Historical precedent: The Thunder have never won an NBA championship since relocating to Oklahoma City. Their last NBA Finals appearance was in 2012 when they lost to the Miami Heat. 5. Time for improvement: While the team has potential, it's unlikely they'll make such a significant leap to become championship contenders by the 2024 NBA Finals, which is less than a year away from the question's creation date. 6.
