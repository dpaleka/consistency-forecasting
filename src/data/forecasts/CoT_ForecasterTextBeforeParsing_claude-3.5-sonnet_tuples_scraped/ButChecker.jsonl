Mike Pence has not officially announced his candidacy yet. 2. Pence's relationship with Trump: As Trump's former Vice President, Pence had a falling out with Trump over the 2020 election results and the events of January 6th. This has likely damaged his standing with Trump's base, which is a significant portion of the Republican electorate. 3. Pence's appeal: While Pence has strong conservative credentials and experience as Vice President, he lacks the charisma and populist appeal that have driven recent Republican primaries. 4. Polling data: Current polls show Pence trailing significantly behind other potential candidates, often polling in single digits. 5. Fundraising: Pence's fundraising efforts have been modest compared to other potential candidates, which could limit his ability to run an effective campaign. 6. Time until the convention: There is still considerable time until the Republican National Convention in 2024, which means the political landscape could change. However, Pence would need to overcome significant obstacles to become a frontrunner. 7. Historical precedent: It's rare for a former Vice President to win their party's nomination without having been President, especially when competing against their former running mate. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Mike Pence will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. While it's not impossible, the odds are stacked against him.

It's highly unusual for an incumbent president to withdraw from seeking re-nomination, especially this far in advance. Biden has consistently expressed his commitment to running again, and his campaign is actively preparing for the 2024 election. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, there are no strong indications that he plans to step aside. The deadline for this announcement (July 15, 2024) is also very close to the Democratic National Convention, making it even less likely for such a major change to occur at that late stage. (b) Kamala Harris's odds increasing in Nate Silver's model: This part is more challenging to predict because it's based on a specific model and a short time frame (the next week). As of the question's creation date (July 2, 2023), Harris's odds in most prediction models are relatively low. For her odds to increase significantly to over 46.6% in Nate Silver's model within a week would require a major political event or shift.

However, the events of January 6, 2021, and Trump's alleged role in them have created a unique situation. 2. Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in several states to remove Trump from the ballot using this argument. Colorado and Maine have already made decisions to remove Trump from their primary ballots, though these decisions are being appealed. 3. Supreme Court involvement: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the Colorado case, which could set a nationwide precedent. Their decision will likely have a significant impact on similar efforts in other states. 4. Timing: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is after most primary elections will have taken place. This gives ample time for legal challenges to be resolved. 5. Political climate: The issue is highly contentious and politically charged, which could influence decision-making processes in different states. 6. State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently, potentially leading to varied outcomes across the country. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that Trump will be removed or blocked from at least one state's primary ballot by the resolution date. The Colorado and Maine decisions, even if overturned, demonstrate that some states are willing to take this step. The Supreme Court's decision will be crucial, but even if it rules in Trump's favor, there's a possibility that at least one state might still find grounds to remove him from their ballot.

Donald Trump becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Trump remains a dominant figure in the Republican Party and has a strong base of supporters. He has already announced his candidacy and is leading in many polls for the Republican primary. However, he faces several challenges: - Legal issues, including multiple indictments - Competition from other Republican candidates like Ron DeSantis - Potential fatigue among some Republican voters Despite these challenges, Trump's influence on the party and his dedicated base make him a frontrunner. I would estimate the probability of him becoming the nominee at around 70%. 2. Trump not being removed or blocked from any state's primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This is a more complex issue. Several attempts have been made to use the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running, based on his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot.

Some states (e.g., Colorado, Maine) have already made moves to remove Trump from their primary ballots, although these decisions have faced legal challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on this issue, which suggests it's a serious constitutional question. However, given the conservative majority on the Supreme Court and the unprecedented nature of such a disqualification, it seems unlikely that Trump will be permanently removed from ballots in multiple states by July 15, 2024. Even if some states do remove him, there's a high chance of legal battles and potential reinstatements before the specified date. (b) Regarding Trump being the Republican nominee: Trump is currently the front-runner for the Republican nomination, with a significant lead in most polls. He has a strong base of support within the Republican Party. Despite legal challenges and controversies, his popularity among Republican voters remains high. The Republican establishment, while sometimes at odds with Trump, has largely fallen in line behind him in previous elections. While there are other candidates in the race, none have shown the ability to seriously challenge Trump's position so far.

Fundraising ability: To become a serious contender, Elder would need to demonstrate significant fundraising capabilities, which he has not yet proven on a national scale. Policy positions: While Elder's conservative views align with much of the Republican base, it's unclear if he can distinguish himself from other candidates with similar positions. Competition: The Republican field is likely to be crowded with well-known figures who have more established national profiles and support networks. Time until convention: There is still a significant amount of time until the 2024 Republican National Convention, which means the political landscape could change. However, this also means that currently more prominent candidates have time to solidify their positions. Historical precedent: It's rare for a candidate with no prior elected office experience to secure a major party nomination, though not impossible (e.g., Donald Trump in 2016). Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Larry Elder to become the Republican nominee, it seems highly unlikely at this point.

(a) Kamala Harris becoming President or Acting President before July 26, 2024: This scenario is highly unlikely under normal circumstances. For this to happen, President Joe Biden would need to either resign, be removed from office, or become incapacitated. Given that: - Biden's health, while a topic of discussion due to his age, has not shown any severe issues that would likely lead to incapacitation. - There are no serious impeachment proceedings or scandals that might force his resignation. - The 25th Amendment process for temporary transfer of power is rare and usually planned (e.g., for medical procedures). The probability of this occurring is very low, perhaps around 2-3%. (b) Joe Biden dropping out of the race before July 20, 2024: This scenario is also unlikely but slightly more plausible than (a). Factors to consider: - Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. - He has the support of the Democratic Party establishment. - Dropping out this late in the election cycle would be highly unusual and potentially damaging to the party. However, there are some factors that could potentially lead to this outcome: - Biden's age and potential health concerns. - Poor polling numbers or a significant political scandal. - Pressure from within the party if they believe he cannot win. Given these factors, the probability of this occurring might be slightly higher, perhaps around 5-7%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves YES if either of these events occurs. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can estimate the combined probability as: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Assuming the events are largely independent (which is reasonable given their nature), P(A and B) is very small and can be neglected. Taking the higher end of our estimates for a more conservative approach: P(A or B) \u2248 3% + 7% = 10%.

Let's break down the key factors: 1. Legal precedent: In 2023, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled to remove Trump from the state's primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. However, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned this decision in March 2024, ruling that states cannot unilaterally disqualify candidates for federal office under the 14th Amendment. 2. Supreme Court ruling impact: The Supreme Court's decision sets a strong precedent that makes it significantly less likely for any state to successfully remove Trump from their primary ballot under the 14th Amendment. 3. Time frame: The question resolves on July 15, 2024, which is after the primary season for most states. This reduces the window of opportunity for such an action to occur and be in effect by the resolution date. 4. Political climate: Despite ongoing legal challenges and controversies surrounding Trump, there is strong support for him within the Republican party, making it politically difficult for Republican-controlled states to attempt such a move. 5. Legal challenges: Any attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would likely face immediate legal challenges, which could prevent it from being in effect by the resolution date. 6. State-level actions: While some states might attempt to remove Trump from their ballots, the Supreme Court ruling makes it highly unlikely that such attempts would succeed or remain in effect by July 15, 2024. Given these factors, especially the Supreme Court's ruling, it seems highly improbable that Trump will be successfully removed or blocked from any state's primary election ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by the resolution date.

(b) Donald Trump not being removed or blocked from any state's primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This is a more complex issue. There have been discussions and some legal attempts to use the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running, based on his actions related to the January 6th Capitol riot.

However, surprises can happen in politics. 5. Time until convention: There's still a significant amount of time until the Republican National Convention in 2024. This allows for potential shifts in public opinion or unforeseen events that could change the race dynamics. 6. Crowded field: A large number of candidates could potentially split the vote, which might benefit lesser-known candidates. However, this seems more likely to benefit other stronger candidates than Suarez or Haley. 7. Party establishment: Neither Suarez nor Haley seems to have strong backing from the Republican party establishment at this point. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for either Suarez or Haley to win the nomination, it appears highly unlikely. Trump and DeSantis have a significant lead, and even if they falter, there are other candidates who currently seem more likely to benefit."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0062001855525478655, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0020667285175159553, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.11009637651263604, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Regional parties: The influence of regional parties can impact national election results, but they are unlikely to form a government without aligning with either BJP or INC. 5. Modi's popularity: Despite some criticisms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains a popular figure among a significant portion of the Indian electorate. 6.

Current political landscape: As of now, Donald Trump is still the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, with Ron DeSantis as his main challenger. Ted Cruz has not officially announced his candidacy for the 2024 election. 2. Ron DeSantis's prospects: DeSantis has been gaining popularity among Republicans and is seen as a potential alternative to Trump. He has a strong base in Florida and has been positioning himself as a conservative leader on various issues. 3. Ted Cruz's situation: Cruz ran for president in 2016 but has not shown strong indications of running in 2024. His focus seems to be on his Senate role rather than a presidential bid. 4. Trump factor: The biggest obstacle for DeSantis (or any other Republican candidate) is Trump's continued popularity within the party. If Trump decides to run, it could significantly reduce DeSantis's chances. 5.

The timeframe is very short (less than 3 weeks from the question's creation date). 2. Biden is the incumbent president and has strong support within the Democratic party. 3. There have been no major scandals or health issues that would prompt such a drastic action. 4. Democratic Senators would be hesitant to undermine their party's unity so close to an election. The probability of this occurring is very low, likely less than 1%. (b) Another Democratic party presidential debate: This scenario is also unlikely, but slightly more possible than (a): 1. Biden is the presumptive nominee, and the party typically doesn't hold debates when there's a clear frontrunner. 2. However, there's still time before the Democratic National Convention for unexpected events to occur. 3. If Biden were to face a significant challenge or decide not to run, a debate could be organized. 4. The possibility of a debate happening is slightly higher than 10 Senators calling for Biden to drop out, but still low. The probability of this occurring is low, perhaps around 5-10%. Combining these probabilities, we need to consider that only one of these events needs to occur for the question to resolve YES. Using the principle of addition for mutually exclusive events (which is a simplification but reasonable in this case), we can add the probabilities: 1% (scenario a) + 7.5% (average of 5-10% for scenario b) = 8.5%.

Based on Ireland's recent struggles but occasional qualifications, and considering their historical strength and potential for diaspora voting support, I would estimate their chances of qualifying at around 40%.

Time frame: The question is about availability on June 30, 2024, which is more than a year away. This gives OpenAI ample time to address any regulatory concerns and make necessary adjustments. 6. Public demand: There is significant public and business interest in AI tools like ChatGPT in the EU, which creates pressure for continued availability. 7. Competition: Other AI companies are also expanding in the EU market, which may motivate OpenAI to maintain its presence. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that ChatGPT will be generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024. The main risks are potential regulatory hurdles, but OpenAI has shown the ability to navigate these successfully so far. The long time frame also allows for addressing any issues that may arise."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "0f834641-2728-4e1d-83c4-3de2debd9494", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15, 2023, and (b) OpenAI's ChatGPT not be generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024?", "body": "(a) Resolves YES if the market embedded in the link has 377 traders before market close (July 15, 11:59 PM Pacific Time).

(a) The market reaching 377 traders by July 15, 2023: This part is time-sensitive and has already passed. As of now, we don't have access to the actual results of this market. However, given that this was a short-term prediction (less than two months from creation to resolution) and it seems to be part of some 'market shenanigans,' it's quite possible that it did reach 377 traders. Without concrete information, we can estimate this at around 50% probability. (b) OpenAI's ChatGPT not being generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024: This is a more complex prediction. Several factors come into play: 1. EU regulations: The EU has strict data protection laws (GDPR) and is developing AI regulations. OpenAI has already faced challenges in Italy due to these regulations. 2. OpenAI's adaptability: OpenAI has shown willingness to adapt to regulations, as evidenced by their response to the Italian ban. 3. Time frame: The prediction is for about a year in the future, which gives OpenAI time to adapt but also gives regulators time to implement new rules. 4. Definition of 'generally available': The question allows for partial availability (e.g., to adults only) to still count as 'not generally available.' Given these factors, there's a significant chance that ChatGPT might face restrictions in the EU. However, OpenAI also has strong incentives to comply with regulations and maintain access to the European market. I would estimate the probability of ChatGPT not being generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, at around 40%.

Given that the date is about a year from now, it's possible that OpenAI could make the necessary adjustments to comply with EU regulations. However, the EU's strict stance on AI and data protection makes this uncertain. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 60%. b) The linked market reaching 377 traders by July 15, 2024: This condition is more difficult to assess without access to the current number of traders in the market.

The long timeframe works in favor of this condition. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 70%.

Biden has already surpassed this, but as a high-ranking official with access to excellent healthcare, his life expectancy could be higher than average. 3.

The probability of death occurring in such a short period is generally low for any individual, barring known severe health issues or high-risk situations. 5.

There are no prominent female candidates currently challenging Biden for the nomination. The only scenario where a woman might become the nominee is if Biden unexpectedly withdraws or is unable to run, which seems unlikely at this point.

The probability of any person dying within a specific 3-week period is generally low, even for someone in their 80s.

He has announced his intention to run for re-election, and the Democratic Party typically supports incumbent presidents. However, there are several factors to consider: 1. Biden's age and potential health concerns could lead to him stepping aside. 2. His current approval ratings are relatively low, which could encourage other candidates. 3.

This is a relatively short time frame for such a significant political move. 5. Risk for Democrats: Publicly calling for the incumbent president to drop out is a risky move that could backfire, potentially damaging party unity and individual political careers. 6. Biden's resolve: Despite concerns, Biden has shown no indication of considering dropping out, which might make some Democrats hesitant to take such a drastic step. 7. Precedent: It's highly unusual for a sitting president to be pressured to drop out by members of their own party, making this a rare occurrence. 8. Threshold: The requirement of at least 5 named Democrats working together raises the bar, making it more challenging to achieve. Given these factors, I believe there's a significant chance of this occurring, but it's not highly probable. The existing dissent and behind-the-scenes activity suggest momentum, but the short time frame, the high stakes of such a move, and the unusual nature of the request work against it happening."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "6f0b7941-df0d-4bea-b4d8-02cfe00a82cc", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President, and (b) fewer than 5 named Democratic House Members or US Senators pressure Biden to drop out before July 20, 2024?", "body": "(a) Will Joe Biden announce before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President?\n\nThis resolves as Yes if prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement to the effect that Joe Biden will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.

(a) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination: As of now, Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. It's highly unusual for an incumbent president to drop out of the race, especially this close to the election. Biden has consistently expressed his commitment to running, and his team has been actively campaigning. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, there's no strong indication that Biden is considering stepping aside. The deadline of July 15, 2024, is very close to the Democratic National Convention, making it even less likely for such a major change to occur at that late stage. Probability for (a): 0.05 (5%) (b) Fewer than 5 named Democratic House Members or US Senators pressuring Biden to drop out: This part is more likely to occur. While there have been some Democrats who have expressed concerns about Biden's candidacy, there hasn't been a significant, organized effort to pressure him to drop out. Most Democratic leaders have publicly supported Biden's re-election bid. It's important to note that this part resolves as 'Yes' if fewer than 5 members pressure Biden, which means it would also be true if no one pressures him at all. Given the party's tendency to rally behind the incumbent and the potential political risks of publicly opposing the sitting president, it's quite possible that fewer than 5 prominent Democrats would take such a bold step.

Two safe-seat members have publicly urged Biden to drop out, and two endangered Democrats have expressed pessimism about Biden's chances. 3.

The deadline (July 15, 2024) is very close to the Democratic National Convention, making such a late withdrawal unlikely. 4. Biden's team has been actively campaigning and fundraising for his re-election. However, we can't completely rule out this possibility due to Biden's age and potential unforeseen circumstances.

She's also known for surprising her fans. However, there's no concrete evidence or rumors suggesting her involvement in this particular movie. Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) and Taylor Swift are friends, which could increase the possibility of a cameo, but it's still speculative. Given the secrecy around such cameos and Swift's star power, if it were to happen, it would likely be kept under wraps until release.

The target to beat is $284.5 million, which is significantly higher. However, several factors support the possibility of this movie breaking the record: 1. The immense popularity of both Deadpool and Wolverine characters. 2. This is the first time these characters will appear together in the MCU, creating huge anticipation. 3. The previous Deadpool movies were very successful, with Deadpool 2 having an opening weekend of $125 million domestically. 4. Hugh Jackman's return as Wolverine has generated significant buzz. 5.

Recent events, such as Iran's support for Hamas and other militant groups, have further strained this relationship. 2. Israel's past actions: Israel has a history of conducting covert operations and targeted strikes against perceived threats, including those within Iran. These have included assassinations of nuclear scientists and sabotage of nuclear facilities. 3. Iran's nuclear program: Israel views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat and has consistently opposed it. Any significant advancements in this program could prompt Israeli action. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about two weeks from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a relatively short time frame, which somewhat reduces the likelihood of such an attack occurring. 5. International pressure: The current global focus on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza might deter Israel from opening another front of conflict, as it could face international criticism and potential diplomatic consequences. 6. Retaliation risk: Israel would have to consider the risk of Iranian retaliation, which could escalate into a broader conflict. This risk might make Israel hesitant to carry out a large-scale attack. 7. Definition of \"deadly attack\": The question specifies that at least five individuals must die for it to qualify. This threshold is relatively low, meaning even a small-scale operation could meet the criteria. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability of such an attack occurring.

(a) Vivek Ramaswamy being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new face in politics, having announced his candidacy in February 2023. While he has gained some attention for his views and business background, he faces significant challenges: 1. He lacks political experience compared to other candidates. 2. He has low name recognition among the general public. 3. Current polling data shows him far behind frontrunners like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. 4. The Republican establishment tends to favor more experienced candidates. Given these factors, the probability of Ramaswamy securing the nomination is very low, likely less than 1%. (b) Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024: This scenario is more plausible due to the ongoing investigation in Georgia: 1. Trump is already under investigation for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. 2. There have been reports of potential witness tampering related to this case. 3. The Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, has been actively pursuing the case. 4. Trump's past behavior and statements suggest he may have attempted to influence witnesses. However, there are some factors that might reduce the likelihood: 1. The legal process can be slow, and charges might not be filed before June 1, 2024. 2. There may be political considerations that could delay or prevent charges. 3. The evidence might not be strong enough to support witness tampering charges specifically. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024, to be around 30-40%.

Competition: The Republican field for 2024 is likely to be crowded with more established politicians. Former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and other high-profile Republicans are expected to run or are already running. These candidates have stronger bases of support and greater financial resources. 3. Polling: In current polls for the Republican primary, Ramaswamy consistently ranks low, often in the low single digits. This suggests he has a long way to go to become a frontrunner. 4. Fundraising: While Ramaswamy has personal wealth, his campaign fundraising has not been on par with top-tier candidates. This could limit his ability to compete effectively across multiple states. 5. Media attention: Ramaswamy has received some media coverage, but not nearly as much as the leading candidates. This makes it harder for him to build name recognition and support. 6. Party establishment: The Republican Party establishment tends to favor candidates with more traditional political backgrounds. Ramaswamy's outsider status could work against him in securing party support. 7. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still some time away, which theoretically gives Ramaswamy time to build support. However, it also gives established candidates time to solidify their positions. 8. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for a political newcomer with no prior elected office to secure a major party nomination, though not impossible (as demonstrated by Trump in 2016).

Part A: Biden remaining President through July 2024 Joe Biden is currently the President of the United States and is in generally good health for his age. While there are always risks associated with advanced age (Biden will be 81 in July 2024), the probability of a sitting president not completing their term due to death, resignation, or removal is historically low. Presidents typically serve out their full terms barring extraordinary circumstances.

Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 election. While there have been concerns about his age and some polls showing low approval ratings, there hasn't been any significant movement within the Democratic Party to push him out. For five named lawmakers to publicly pressure him to drop out would be an extraordinary and potentially damaging move for the party. It's more likely that any such discussions would happen behind closed doors rather than in a public manner that meets the criteria specified. Combining these scenarios, we need only one to occur for the question to resolve as YES. The first scenario (EU tariffs) is more likely than the second (Dem lawmakers), but both are still relatively low probability events within the given timeframes.

Current polling shows a close race between Biden and Trump, with leads often within the margin of error. The specific condition (lead \u22642 or >3) covers a large range of possible outcomes, making it more likely to occur.

The number of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing as neutrals. 2. The strength of these athletes in their respective sports. 3. The competition they face from other countries. Given the recent geopolitical situation, it's likely that the number of neutral athletes will be limited. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee (not technically neutral, but under restrictions) won 20 gold medals. However, the restrictions for Paris 2024 may be stricter, potentially reducing the number of participating athletes and their chances of winning. Achieving 15 gold medals seems challenging but not impossible.

(a) Men's 100m dash Olympic record: The current Olympic record of 9.63s was set by Usain Bolt in 2012. Breaking this record would be a significant achievement. While sprinting times have been improving over the years, progress at the elite level has slowed. The current world record is 9.58s, also held by Bolt since 2009. In recent years, no sprinter has consistently approached these times. The fastest time in 2023 was 9.83s by Noah Lyles. While there's always a possibility of an exceptional performance, breaking 9.63s seems unlikely. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 15%. (b) Individual Neutral Athletes winning 15 or more gold medals: \"Individual Neutral Athletes\" typically refers to athletes from countries that are banned from competing under their national flag, often due to doping violations. In recent Olympics, this has mainly applied to Russian athletes. In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes competing as neutrals won 20 gold medals. However, the situation for Paris 2024 is uncertain. Russia and Belarus are currently banned from international competitions due to the invasion of Ukraine. While there's a possibility of some athletes competing as neutrals, it's unlikely to be a full contingent. Given the reduced number of potential participants and the uncertainty of their participation, achieving 15 or more gold medals seems improbable. I'd estimate the probability at around 10%. Combining probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs.

Eurovision voting patterns: Both countries have established voting blocs that can help them. Portugal often receives support from Spanish-speaking countries and former colonies, while Armenia typically gets votes from other Caucasus countries and the Armenian diaspora. Quality of entries: While we don't know the specific songs for 2024 yet, both countries have generally sent competitive entries in recent years. Semi-final allocation: The semi-final allocation can affect chances of qualification, but this information is not available at the time of this forecast. Combined chances: With two countries in contention, the odds of at least one qualifying are higher than for a single country.

Nature of swimming events: Swimming has many events (different strokes, distances, and relays) allowing talented swimmers to compete in multiple races, increasing their chances of winning multiple medals. 3. Current swimming stars: We need to consider the current top swimmers who are likely to compete in 2024. For example, Caeleb Dressel (USA) won five gold medals in Tokyo 2020, showing the potential for swimmers to dominate. 4. Competition from other sports: We must also consider strong contenders from other sports, particularly those with multiple events like gymnastics, athletics, or cycling. 5. Team sports vs. individual sports: Individual sports like swimming generally offer more opportunities for a single athlete to win multiple medals compared to team sports. 6. Recent Olympic trends: In Tokyo 2020, swimmers did very well, with Caeleb Dressel (5 golds) and Emma McKeon (4 golds) among the top medal winners. 7. Time until the Olympics: With the Olympics about a year away, current form and recent performances will be indicative, but there's still time for new stars to emerge or established athletes to improve. Given these factors, swimmers have a strong historical precedent and structural advantages (multiple events) that put them in a favorable position.

Growth potential: Nvidia is at the forefront of AI and GPU technology, which are rapidly growing sectors. The AI boom has already significantly boosted Nvidia's stock price in 2023. However, sustaining this growth rate for another year might be challenging. Apple, while a stable and profitable company, has been experiencing slower growth in recent years.

Therefore, the probability of Harris being nominated as VP is quite high.\n\n(b) Joe Biden not announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination: As of the creation date of this question (July 1, 2024), Joe Biden has already announced his intention to run for re-election and has been actively campaigning. It would be highly unusual and politically damaging for an incumbent president to suddenly announce they won't accept their party's nomination, especially this close to the election. Barring any unforeseen health issues or major scandals, it's very unlikely that Biden would make such an announcement before July 15, 2024. The probability of Biden not making such an announcement is very high.\n\nCombining these two factors: For this question to resolve as YES, both conditions must be met. Given that both conditions are highly likely to occur independently, the overall probability of both occurring together is also high. However, we must account for a small margin of uncertainty, as unexpected events can always occur in politics."}}}, "P_or_Q": {"question": {"id": "65482ca4-caf7-4d7c-9bd5-8ec9bd3e0b6a", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Joe Biden announces before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President, or (b) Kamala Harris is nominated as the Democratic VP?", "body": "(a) This part of the question will resolve as **Yes** if, prior to 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, Joe Biden or his campaign makes a definitive, public, official announcement that he will not seek and will not accept the nomination of his party for another term as President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.

(a) Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the Democratic nomination: As of now, Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. It's highly unusual for an incumbent president to drop out of the race, especially this close to the election. Biden has consistently expressed his commitment to running, and his campaign is actively preparing for the 2024 election. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, there's no strong indication that Biden is considering stepping aside. The deadline (July 15, 2024) is also very close to the Democratic National Convention, making a last-minute change even less likely. I would assign a very low probability to this scenario, around 5%. (b) Kamala Harris being nominated as the Democratic VP: Kamala Harris is the current Vice President and has been working closely with Biden throughout his term. It's common practice for incumbent presidents to keep their running mates when seeking re-election, as it provides continuity and stability. While there have been some criticisms of Harris's performance, Biden has publicly supported her and expressed confidence in her abilities. Barring any unforeseen circumstances or major scandals, it's highly likely that Harris will be nominated again as the Democratic VP candidate. I would assign a high probability to this scenario, around 90%. For the question to resolve as YES, either of these scenarios needs to occur. Using the probability rule for independent events (P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)), we can calculate: P(A or B) = 0.05 + 0.90 - (0.05 * 0.90) = 0.905.

(a) At least 5 countries winning their first-ever Olympic medal: In recent Olympics, it's been relatively common for a few countries to win their first medals. For example: In Tokyo 2020, San Marino, Burkina Faso, and Turkmenistan won their first medals. In Rio 2016, Fiji, Jordan, and Kosovo won their first medals. The expansion of Olympic sports and the increasing global participation make it more likely for new countries to win medals.

(b) Fewer than 5 countries winning their first-ever Olympic gold medal: Winning a gold medal is significantly more challenging than winning any medal.

In Tokyo 2020, only three countries (Bermuda, Philippines, and Qatar) won their first gold medals. In Rio 2016, only two countries (Fiji and Kosovo) won their first gold medals. Many countries that haven't won a gold medal yet may have already won silver or bronze medals in previous Olympics, making them ineligible for this category.

The historical precedent shows that even in recent Olympics, 3-4 countries have achieved such milestones. With the continued expansion of the Olympic program and the development of sports in various countries, reaching 5 seems feasible. However, it's not a certainty. The shorter time frame since Tokyo 2020 might slightly reduce the chances of dramatic changes in performance.

Hosting the Olympics often provides a boost to a country's performance due to increased funding, home advantage, and motivation. France has been investing heavily in its Olympic program for the 2024 Games. Given these factors, there's a good chance France will improve its ranking from Tokyo and potentially reach the Top 5.

Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal: Sha'Carri Richardson is a talented American sprinter who has shown great potential. However, winning an Olympic gold medal is extremely challenging, especially in highly competitive events like the 100m sprint and 4x100m relay. While she has impressive personal bests, she will face tough competition from other world-class athletes. Additionally, her performance can be affected by various factors such as form, injuries, and pressure. Given her talent but also the fierce competition, I'd estimate her chances of winning a gold medal at around 30%. 2. France placing in the Top 5 at the 2024 Paris Olympics: France has several factors in its favor for a strong performance in the 2024 Olympics: - Home advantage: Hosting the Olympics often leads to improved performance due to familiar conditions, crowd support, and increased investment in athletes. - Recent performance: France finished 8th in the medal table at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, showing they are already close to the top 5. - Increased funding and focus: Host nations typically invest heavily in their Olympic programs leading up to the games. However, breaking into the top 5 is challenging, as it means outperforming traditional powerhouses like the USA, China, Japan, Great Britain, and Russia (if allowed to compete). Given these factors, I'd estimate France's chances of finishing in the top 5 at about 40%. Combining the probabilities: The question resolves YES if either of these events occurs. To calculate the overall probability, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) Assuming the events are independent: P(Richardson gold OR France top 5) = 0.30 + 0.40 - (0.30 * 0.40) = 0.58 This calculation suggests that there's a slightly better than even chance that at least one of these outcomes will occur."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.034454804531409366, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.011484934843803122, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2593445365924775, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Predicting currency exchange rates over a year in advance is challenging due to numerous factors including economic policies, interest rates, geopolitical events, and global economic conditions. However, the yen has been relatively weak against the dollar in recent years due to Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy. Unless there's a significant shift in policy or global economic conditions, it's plausible that the USD could remain strong against the JPY. Still, a year is a long time in forex markets, and there's considerable uncertainty. (b) Trump's performance against Biden vs. generic Democrat: This part is based on two Manifold polls. Public opinion polls have shown Trump performing better against Biden than against a generic Democrat. However, Manifold respondents might not be representative of the general public. They could be more informed or have different biases. The question specifically asks if Trump will gain less than 3% when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents.

The difference in Trump's performance between these polls would need to be 3% or more. Given that Joe Biden is a known quantity with both strengths and weaknesses, while a 'generic Democrat' is an idealized concept, it's possible that Trump could perform better against Biden specifically. However, a 3% difference is quite significant. Without access to current polling data or trends, it's difficult to say with certainty, but I'd estimate this has about a 30% chance of occurring. (b) USD being worth >= 145 JPY at close on August 9th, 2024: This part is more straightforward but involves predicting currency exchange rates over a year into the future, which is inherently uncertain. As of July 2023, the USD/JPY exchange rate is around 144-145. Predicting it to be at or above 145 in August 2024 is not unreasonable, given recent trends and the relative strength of the US economy. However, many factors can influence exchange rates over such a long period. I'd estimate this has about a 60% chance of occurring.

This means Ireland needs to finish in the top 10 of their semi-final to qualify. 4. Selection process: The method Ireland uses to select their entry can impact their chances. If they choose a strong, competitive entry, it could improve their odds. 5. Voting patterns: Ireland often receives support from countries with large Irish diaspora populations, such as the UK. However, this hasn't been enough to secure qualification in recent years. 6. Potential for improvement: Given their recent string of non-qualifications, there may be increased pressure and motivation to select a stronger entry and improve their performance. 7. Unpredictability of Eurovision: The contest can be unpredictable, with results sometimes defying expectations based on factors like running order, staging, and performance on the night. Considering these factors, Ireland's chances of qualifying are not particularly strong based on recent history. However, Eurovision results can be unpredictable, and with a strong entry and performance, qualification is certainly possible. The pressure to improve after several years of non-qualification might lead to a more competitive entry. Given the recent track record and the competitive nature of Eurovision, I would estimate Ireland's chances of qualifying for the Grand Final as slightly below 50%, but not dramatically so."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "551cf893-6737-417e-9870-1120959df38c", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Cyprus qualifies for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024 and (b) Ireland fails to qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Cyprus participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final, and (2) Ireland either does not participate in a Semi-final or is officially announced by the EBU as not having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Timing: The question is about a specific 12-day period in July 2024, which is about a year from now. This makes the prediction challenging as solar activity can be unpredictable over such a long timeframe. 2. Solar Cycle: We are currently in Solar Cycle 25, which began in December 2019. Solar cycles typically last about 11 years, with solar activity increasing towards the middle of the cycle and then decreasing.

We're approaching solar maximum, which increases the likelihood of such events. The 12-day window also provides a reasonable timeframe for such an event to occur. However, we must also consider that the question is very specific about the K-index range. It's possible that during this period, we might see either weaker storms (K-index \u2264 5) or stronger storms (K-index > 6), which would result in a 'No' resolution.

Health concerns: Biden is the oldest sitting president in U.S. history, and health issues could arise. 2. Political pressure: If Biden's approval ratings significantly decline or if there's a major scandal, party leaders might pressure him to step aside. 3. Personal decision: Biden might decide he's not up for another term due to the demands of the job. If Biden were to drop out, it's likely that major media outlets would have some advance notice. However, the specific requirement of a 6-hour advance coverage by a reliable media outlet adds another layer of uncertainty. Combining these factors, the overall probability is low but not negligible. The chance of a debate occurring is extremely slim, while the possibility of Biden dropping out with advance media coverage, while still unlikely, is the more plausible of the two scenarios."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0006375116485307364, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0002125038828435788, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.03796667987618719, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Recent events, including Iran's support for Hamas and other groups opposing Israel, have further escalated tensions. 2. Israel's past actions: Israel has a history of conducting covert operations and targeted strikes against perceived threats, including those within Iran. These have included cyberattacks, assassinations of nuclear scientists, and sabotage of nuclear facilities. 3. Time frame: The question covers a relatively short period (about two weeks from the creation date to the resolution date), which limits the window for such an attack to occur. 4. Escalation risks: A direct, deadly attack by Israel within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation, potentially leading to a wider conflict. This risk might make Israel hesitant to carry out such an operation. 5. International pressure: The current global focus on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza might discourage Israel from opening another front of conflict. 6. Iran's defensive capabilities: Iran has improved its air defenses and cyber capabilities in recent years, which could make it more challenging for Israel to carry out a successful attack. 7. Israel's current focus: The ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza might be consuming much of Israel's military and intelligence resources, potentially reducing the likelihood of a major operation against Iran in the short term. 8. Recent events: The April 13 Iranian attack on Israel using drones and missiles, and Israel's stated intention to respond, significantly increase the likelihood of Israeli retaliation against Iran. Considering these factors, especially the recent Iranian attack and Israel's declared intention to respond, there is a heightened probability of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024.

Joe Biden dropping out and media coverage: The likelihood of Joe Biden dropping out before the Democratic National Convention is relatively low. He is the incumbent president and has not shown any signs of intending to drop out. However, if he were to drop out, it's highly probable that major media outlets would cover the story well in advance of an official announcement. News of this magnitude would likely leak and be reported on by multiple sources. Given the competitive nature of news reporting, it's very likely that at least one major outlet would break the story at least 6 hours before an official announcement. Probability for this condition: ~0.95 (if Biden were to drop out) However, the probability of Biden dropping out in the first place is quite low, perhaps around 0.05. 2. Israel refraining from a deadly attack within Iran: Tensions between Israel and Iran have been high for years, with occasional covert operations and cyber attacks. However, direct, overt attacks by Israel within Iran's borders resulting in multiple casualties are relatively rare. Israel typically prefers covert operations or strikes on Iranian-linked targets outside of Iran itself. The timeframe (until May 1, 2024) is relatively short, which reduces the likelihood of such an attack occurring. That said, the geopolitical situation in the Middle East is volatile, and unexpected events could trigger an escalation. The ongoing conflict with Hamas and potential Iranian involvement could potentially lead to more direct confrontations.

(a) Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024: The current geopolitical situation between Israel and Iran is tense, with ongoing conflicts and proxy wars in the region. Israel has a history of covert operations against Iran's nuclear program and military assets. However, a direct, deadly attack by Israel within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation and could potentially lead to a wider regional conflict. The timeframe is relatively short (less than three weeks from the question's creation date), which reduces the likelihood of such a major event occurring. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of this part occurring to be low, around 10-15%. (b) Joe Biden dropping out and media coverage: As of now, there are no strong indications that Joe Biden intends to drop out of the presidential race. Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee. His age and some concerns about his health have led to speculation, but he has consistently maintained his intention to run. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22, 2024, which is several months away. Major media outlets are highly competitive and well-connected, making it likely that they would report on such a significant development quickly if it were to occur. However, the specific requirement of a 6-hour advance notice before an official announcement makes this scenario less likely. I estimate the probability of this part occurring to be very low, around 5-10%. Combining these probabilities, we need to consider that only one of these events needs to occur for the question to resolve YES.

A 15% annual growth is not unprecedented but is on the higher side of average annual returns. 3. Economic factors: India's economy is one of the fastest-growing major economies globally. Continued economic growth, foreign investments, and government policies supportive of businesses could drive the index higher. 4. Global economic conditions: Global economic factors, including US interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and international trade relations, can significantly impact the Indian stock market. 5. Specific range: The question asks for a very specific range (75,000 to 76,000), which is a narrow 1,000-point window. This specificity reduces the probability significantly. 6. Time frame: The prediction is for about one year in the future, which allows for significant market movements but also increases uncertainty. 7. Market volatility: Stock markets can be highly volatile, and predicting a specific range for a specific date is challenging. 8. Day of the week: July 21, 2024, is a Sunday, when the stock market is typically closed. The question likely refers to the last trading day before this date, which adds a small element of uncertainty. Considering these factors, while it's possible for the BSE SENSEX to reach the 75,000-76,000 range by July 2024, predicting it to close exactly within this 1,000-point range on a specific date is quite unlikely. The market would need to grow significantly but also stabilize precisely within this range."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "7c478cb0-bdd4-46a6-9f5c-09bd9b9b9a3b", "title": "Will BOTH of the following occur: (a) The linked market gets at least 377 traders by end of July 15, 2023, and (b) On July 21, 2024, the closing value of BSE SENSEX is less than or equal to 75k or greater than 76k?", "body": "(a) The linked market will resolve YES if it has 377 traders before market close (July 15, 2023, 11:59 PM Pacific Time).

We would need to check the actual result of that market to know for certain. However, without that information, we can make an educated guess. Manifold Markets tends to attract a good number of traders, especially for interesting questions. 377 traders is a substantial number, but not unreasonable for a popular market.

The question asks if the value will be \u226475k or >76k, effectively excluding the range between 75k and 76k. To assess this: 1. Current BSE SENSEX value (as of July 4, 2023) is around 65,500. 2. The target date is about a year away, allowing for significant market movement. 3. Historically, the BSE SENSEX has shown long-term growth, but with periods of volatility. 4.

(a) US Core CPI increase: The Core CPI (Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy) is a key measure of inflation. Historically, month-over-month increases of more than 0.1% are common. In recent years, due to various economic factors including the pandemic recovery and supply chain issues, we've seen higher inflation rates. However, the Federal Reserve has been actively working to bring inflation down through interest rate hikes and other monetary policies. As of 2023, inflation has been moderating but still remains above the Fed's 2% target. By July 2024, it's likely that these efforts will have further impact, potentially bringing inflation closer to target levels. However, economic conditions can be unpredictable, and external factors (like geopolitical events or supply shocks) could still cause inflationary pressures. Given recent trends and the time horizon (about a year from now), I would estimate there's still a good chance of seeing a month-over-month increase of more than 0.1% in Core CPI, though less likely than it would have been in 2022 or early 2023.

It would require the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to agree that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Despite some calls from opposition lawmakers, there's no substantial evidence suggesting Biden is incapable of performing his duties. His administration and party would be highly resistant to such a move, which would be seen as a political crisis.

Christie's anti-Trump stance, while appealing to some moderate Republicans, alienates him from a large portion of the Republican base that still strongly supports Trump.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls from within the Democratic Party for a new generation of leadership, Biden has consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. The likelihood of an incumbent president dropping out is historically very low. Barring any severe health issues or unforeseen circumstances, it's unlikely that Biden would voluntarily withdraw from the race. The specified date (July 13, 2024) is also relatively close to the election, making a last-minute dropout even less probable.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, while neither is impossible, both are quite unlikely.

Trump's lawyers would likely advise against it to avoid potential self-incrimination. However, Trump is known for unconventional behavior and might insist on testifying to directly address the jury.

The difference between Trump's performance against Biden versus a generic Democrat is typically small, as Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee and voters are familiar with him. A 3% difference is a significant threshold that would indicate a substantial preference for Trump over Biden compared to a generic Democrat. Such a large swing is unlikely, especially given that Biden and Trump have faced each other before, and their relative strengths and weaknesses are well-known to voters.

Kamala Harris' VP Pick: - The question states that Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are currently the two favorites for Kamala's running mate. - However, VP selections are often unpredictable and can involve many factors beyond current favorites. - The resolution date is set for August 6, 2024, which is consistent with the reported timeline of Kamala choosing before August 7th. - Given that there are likely many potential candidates being considered, and VP selections often involve surprise choices, the probability of either Kelly or Shapiro being selected seems relatively low. 2. The linked market getting at least 377 traders by end of July 15: - This part of the question is more straightforward and time-bound. - Without access to the current number of traders in the market or historical data on trader growth rates for similar markets, it's difficult to make a precise estimate. - However, reaching 377 traders in a specific prediction market within about 11 days (from the creation date to July 15) seems like a challenging target, especially for a niche question. Considering both parts: - For the question to resolve YES, either of these events needs to occur. - The VP pick is unlikely to be announced before July 15, so the market trader count is the more immediate factor. - The VP pick resolution will come later, providing a second chance for a YES resolution if the market trader count doesn't reach the target. Given these factors, I would estimate a moderate probability for this question resolving YES. The market trader count seems unlikely to reach the target, but there's still a chance for a YES resolution through the VP pick, albeit a relatively low one."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15415660399455183, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Industry trends: There's a growing emphasis on AI safety and transparency in the AI industry. Many leading AI companies are increasingly open about their safety measures and external audits. 2. Regulatory pressure: Governments and regulatory bodies are pushing for more transparency and safety measures in AI development. This could incentivize companies like Inflection to conduct and publish external safety audits. 3. Inflection's profile: Inflection is a relatively new but well-funded AI company, founded by high-profile individuals from the tech industry. They may want to establish credibility and trust by demonstrating their commitment to safety. 4. Timeframe: The question gives a deadline of June 30, 2024, which is about a year from now. This provides ample time for Inflection to conduct external red-teaming and prepare a report. 5. Competitive landscape: Other major AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have published safety reports. Inflection may feel pressure to follow suit to remain competitive and maintain public trust. 6. Lack of public commitment: As of now, I'm not aware of any public commitment from Inflection to publish such a report by the given date. 7.

(a) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination: Currently, Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden has consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. Given his position as the incumbent and the lack of any strong indicators that he might step aside, it seems unlikely that he would make such a dramatic announcement before July 15, 2024. The Democratic Party has also shown strong support for his candidacy. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of unforeseen health issues or other unexpected events that could lead to such a decision. (b) Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024: Chasiv Yar is a strategically important location in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine. As of now (April 2024), it is under Ukrainian control but has been a target of Russian forces. The war in Ukraine has been ongoing for over two years, and the front lines have been relatively static in recent months. While Russia has shown a renewed offensive capability in some areas, taking control of Chasiv Yar would require a significant breakthrough in the current lines. However, the war's dynamics can change, and a year is a long time in terms of military operations. There's a possibility that Russia could make advances in this region, but it's not highly probable given the current situation and Ukraine's defensive capabilities. Considering both scenarios, while neither is highly likely, the possibility of Russian control of Chasiv Yar seems slightly more plausible than Biden withdrawing from the race. The long timeframe until the resolution date (over a year) adds uncertainty to both scenarios."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.13770871910720528, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.04590290636906843, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.533438117607827, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, it's not guaranteed as other nations have been improving their marathon programs. I'd estimate this scenario has about a 60% chance of occurring. 2.

Synergy effect: Combining these two popular characters in one film is likely to create significant buzz and attract fans of both characters, potentially leading to a larger audience than either character alone. 4. Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) integration: This film is expected to integrate these characters into the MCU, which could draw additional interest from the broader Marvel fan base. 5. Star power: Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) are both major stars with strong box office draw. 6.

Taylor Swift's connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): Swift is known to be friends with Ryan Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively, who have connections to the MCU. There have been rumors and fan theories about Swift potentially joining the MCU for years. 2. The character Dazzler: In the Marvel comics, Dazzler is a mutant pop star with the ability to convert sound into light and energy beams. Swift's background as a pop star makes her a fitting choice for this role. 3. Recent speculation: The linked article from People magazine discusses the possibility of Swift playing Dazzler, indicating there's active speculation about her involvement. 4. Marvel's history of surprise cameos: The MCU is known for including unexpected cameos and surprises in their films. 'Deadpool' movies, in particular, are known for their meta-humor and pop culture references. 5. Swift's acting experience: While primarily known as a musician, Swift has acted in films before (e.g., 'Valentine's Day,' 'Cats'), so a cameo is within her capabilities. 6. Timing and secrecy: Marvel is notoriously secretive about their projects, so even if Swift were involved, it might not be publicly confirmed until close to or after the release. 7. Swift's current cultural prominence: Swift is at the height of her career, making her a desirable cameo for any major film. 8. The broad definition of a cameo in the question: The question states that even a voice role would count as a cameo, which increases the possibilities. While there's no concrete evidence of Swift's involvement, the combination of her connections to the MCU circle, the speculation around her playing Dazzler, Marvel's love for surprises, and the broad definition of a cameo in the question all suggest that there's a reasonable chance she might appear in some capacity.

As of now, no state has successfully removed Trump from their ballot under this provision. While some attempts have been made (e.g., in Colorado), they have faced significant legal challenges.

If 299 traders joined in about 46 days (assuming linear growth), that's an average of about 6.5 traders per day. 4.

(b) Concerning ISS advising against Elon Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election: Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is known for its influential recommendations on corporate governance matters. Given recent controversies surrounding Elon Musk's compensation and concerns about Tesla's board independence, there's a significant chance that ISS might recommend against either Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election. In 2018, ISS recommended against Elon Musk's previous compensation plan, citing its unprecedented size and questioning its structure. Given that the new package is even larger ($57 billion), there's a high likelihood that ISS might again recommend against it. Moreover, Kimbal Musk's position on Tesla's board has been criticized for potential conflicts of interest due to his familial relationship with Elon Musk. ISS and other proxy advisors often advocate for independent board members, which could lead to a recommendation against Kimbal Musk's re-election. Considering both scenarios, the probability of at least one of these events occurring seems relatively high. The market reaching 377 traders is possible but uncertain, while the ISS recommendation against either Musk's package or Kimbal's re-election seems more likely based on historical precedent and current corporate governance trends."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.24768528257969072, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0825617608598969, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6951275331535256, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

It would require the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to agree that the President is unable to discharge his duties. While there have been concerns about Biden's age and occasional gaffes, there's no evidence of severe incapacitation that would warrant such an extreme measure.

(b) Joe Biden dying before July 26th, 2024: While Biden is the oldest serving U.S. President at 80 years old (as of 2023), he appears to be in relatively good health for his age. The average life expectancy for an American male is around 76 years, but Biden has already surpassed this and has access to excellent healthcare. However, at his age, there is always an increased risk of health issues or natural causes leading to death. To estimate the probability, we can use actuarial tables, which suggest that for an 80-year-old man, the probability of dying within the next year is roughly 5-6%. However, this is for the general population, and Biden likely has better odds due to his access to top-tier medical care. Combining these factors: The probability of (a) is extremely low, let's estimate it at 0.1% or 0.001. The probability of (b), considering the timeframe of about a year from now, might be around 3-4% or 0.03-0.04.

Given the growing concerns about AI safety and the push for more responsible AI development, there's a moderate chance that OpenAI might make this commitment, estimated at around 40%. For the Pandemic Agreement, it is a complex international agreement that requires consensus among many countries, and given the history of international negotiations, there's a significant chance that the agreement might not be approved, estimated at around 60%.

Pandemic Agreement approval at May 2024 World Health Assembly: The Pandemic Agreement, also known as the WHO pandemic treaty, has been in development since 2021. While there's been progress, there are also challenges and disagreements among member states. The target date for adoption is May 2024, which aligns with this question. However, given the complexity of international agreements and potential for delays, there's uncertainty about whether it will be approved on schedule. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 60%. 2. OpenAI publicly committing to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle: OpenAI has shown a commitment to AI safety and ethics in the past. The 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle aligns with responsible AI development. However, the specific requirement of satisfying a member of righttowarn.ai adds complexity. OpenAI might be hesitant to make commitments that could be seen as ceding control to external groups. Given OpenAI's track record and the growing importance of AI safety, I'd estimate the probability of this happening before July 1, 2024, at around 40%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs.

He has already announced his intention to run for re-election and has been actively campaigning. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls from within the Democratic Party for a younger candidate, Biden has consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. For Biden to announce he won't accept the nomination this close to the deadline (July 15, 2024) would be extremely unusual and highly disruptive to the Democratic Party's election strategy.

Such a decision would require significant preparation and a clear alternative plan, neither of which has been publicly discussed or hinted at.

This is within the range specified in the question (between 2 and 4 points). 2. Time frame: We're looking at the situation 10 days from the current data point (July 5 to July 15). This is a relatively short period in political terms, but still enough time for some shifts to occur. 3.

Election proximity: As we get closer to the election (November 2024), polls tend to become more stable and potentially more accurate. Given these factors, here's my analysis: - The current lead of 2.4 points is already within the specified range, which increases the likelihood of the condition being met. - With only 10 days between the current data point and the date in question, it's unlikely that we'll see dramatic shifts in polling unless there's a major event. - The summer period (July) is often relatively quiet in terms of campaign activities, which further reduces the likelihood of major shifts. - However, there's still some uncertainty. A small shift of 0.5 points in either direction could push the result out of the specified range. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a good chance that Trump's lead will remain within the 2 to 4 point range on July 15, 2024.

Current polling (as of July 2023) shows a close race between Trump and Biden, with some polls giving Trump a slight lead. However, predicting polls a year in advance is challenging due to potential events that could sway public opinion. The specific range (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 points) is quite narrow, making it less likely to occur. Given the polarized nature of US politics, a lead in this range is possible but not highly probable. (b) The linked Manifold market reaching 377 traders: Unfortunately, I don't have access to the current number of traders in the linked market. Manifold Markets is a popular prediction market platform, and some markets can attract hundreds of traders. The timeframe (until July 15, 2024) is quite long, giving ample time for the market to attract traders. 377 traders is a specific and somewhat high number, which might be challenging to reach. However, given the long timeframe and the potential interest in US election-related markets, it's not implausible. Considering both conditions, it seems that condition (b) might be more likely to occur than (a). The specific polling range in (a) is quite narrow and difficult to predict, while the trader count in (b) has a longer time to accumulate and could potentially be driven by increased interest as the election approaches.

In recent years, inflation has been a significant concern, but efforts to curb it have shown some success. However, predicting inflation a year in advance is challenging. Historical data shows that month-over-month Core CPI increases of more than 0.1% are common. For example, in 2023, most months saw increases above 0.1%. Even as inflation has moderated, increases of 0.2% to 0.4% have been typical.

The company has been performing exceptionally well due to the AI boom and its dominant position in the GPU market. For the stock to drop below $100, it would require a catastrophic event or a major market crash. Given the short timeframe (less than a week), this scenario is highly unlikely. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at less than 1%. 2. US Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024: The US Core CPI is a measure of inflation excluding food and energy prices. In recent years, the Federal Reserve has been working to control inflation. However, predicting inflation accurately is challenging. Looking at historical data, monthly increases of more than 0.1% in Core CPI are not uncommon. In fact, they occur quite frequently. Given the uncertainty in economic conditions and the tendency for inflation to fluctuate, I'd estimate the probability of Core CPI increasing by more than 0.1% in July 2024 at around 60-70%. Combining these probabilities: Since we only need one of these events to occur for the question to resolve as YES, we can use the probability union formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

Given the current pace of the conflict, it's possible but not highly likely that Russia would capture Chasiv Yar by June 2024. The Ukrainian forces have shown strong resistance, and Western support continues. However, Russia has been known to concentrate efforts on specific targets. I'd estimate the probability of this occurring at around 30%. b) Donald Trump being removed or blocked from primary ballots under the 14th Amendment: This is a complex legal and political issue. The 14th Amendment, Section 3, prohibits those who have 'engaged in insurrection' from holding office. Some argue that Trump's actions related to the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot qualify.

Polls can fluctuate significantly based on current events, economic conditions, and campaign developments.

By July 2024, some of these pressures may have eased, potentially leading to a more stable economic outlook.

Predicting its exact value a year in advance is challenging, as it's influenced by various economic factors, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. However, we can consider some factors: 1. Current economic uncertainties (post-pandemic recovery, inflation concerns, geopolitical tensions) might persist into 2024. 2. The year 2024 is a US presidential election year, which often increases market volatility. 3. Historical data shows that volatility tends to fluctuate, and year-over-year increases are not uncommon.

He undergoes regular medical check-ups, and there have been no recent reports of serious health concerns. 2. Life expectancy: The average life expectancy for an 81-year-old American male is around 7-8 more years. While this doesn't guarantee anything, it suggests that sudden death is not highly probable. 3. Presidential protection: As the President of the United States, Biden receives excellent medical care and is constantly monitored, which reduces the risk of sudden, unexpected health issues. 4. Short time frame: The question asks about a very short time frame - less than two weeks from the creation date to the resolution date. The probability of death occurring in such a short period is generally low for someone without known terminal illnesses. 5. No known imminent threats: There are no publicly known imminent threats to Biden's life, such as serious illnesses or high-risk situations. 6. Historical precedent: No sitting U.S. president has died in office since John F. Kennedy in 1963, and that was due to assassination rather than natural causes. Given these factors, the probability of Joe Biden dying before Saturday, July 27, 2024, is very low.

(a) Kimberly Cheatle no longer being Director of the U.S. Secret Service before October 12, 2024: Cheatle was appointed in August 2022, so by October 2024, she would have served for about 2 years. The average tenure for Secret Service Directors is typically around 3-5 years, though there have been exceptions. There's no current indication of any controversy or reason for her to leave the position prematurely.

However, he has access to excellent healthcare and is under constant medical supervision. The timeframe given is relatively short (about two weeks from the question's creation date). While his age is a factor, the probability of him dying in this specific short period is quite low. I'd estimate the probability of Biden not dying before July 26th at about 99.5%.

The Secret Service Director position is typically stable unless there are major security breaches or scandals.

Donald Trump is currently the overwhelming frontrunner for the Republican nomination, with most polls showing him having a substantial lead over other potential candidates. Cruz has not announced his candidacy for 2024, and even if he did, his support among Republican voters is not nearly strong enough to challenge Trump or other leading candidates like Ron DeSantis. The probability of Cruz securing the nomination is very close to zero. b) Trump's lead over Biden being between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024: This is a very specific range, which makes it less likely to occur. However, it's not entirely implausible. Current polls show a close race between Trump and Biden, with some polls giving Trump a slight lead. The specific requirement of the lead being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points makes this a narrow window. While it's possible that the race could tighten to this exact range by July 2024, the probability is relatively low. I would estimate this to be around 10-15% chance. Combining these probabilities: Since either condition would result in a YES resolution, we need to consider the probability of either event occurring. Given that the first condition (Cruz as nominee) is extremely unlikely, the overall probability is primarily driven by the second condition (Trump's specific lead over Biden).

Google DeepMind's recent merger: The recent merger of Google Brain and DeepMind into Google DeepMind might lead to changes in policies and practices, potentially including more emphasis on safety and transparency. 6. Regulatory environment: With increasing scrutiny on AI development, there may be regulatory pressures or voluntary industry standards emerging that encourage or require such safety assessments and public reporting. However, there are also factors that might reduce the likelihood: 1. Competitive advantage: Google DeepMind might be hesitant to reveal potential vulnerabilities or limitations of their models publicly. 2. Internal processes: They might prefer to conduct internal red-teaming rather than involving external parties. 3. Timing: While the timeframe is generous, unexpected delays or shifts in priorities could push such an initiative beyond the specified date. Considering all these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Google DeepMind will publish such a report by the given deadline. The increasing focus on AI safety, industry trends, and the ample time frame are particularly strong factors in favor of this outcome. However, there's still significant uncertainty due to potential competitive concerns and unknown internal priorities."}}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"question": {"id": "b44543a5-3e35-4e1e-80f8-78feebba2eb1", "title": "Will both of the following occur by June 30, 2024: (a) OpenAI's ChatGPT is generally available in the European Union, and (b) Google DeepMind does not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety?", "body": "(a) The question about OpenAI's ChatGPT resolves as **YES** if [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) is generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024, and **NO** otherwise. \"Generally available\" means that the default state for people in the EU is that they can access it without a VPN (possibly requiring paying for it.)

(a) OpenAI's ChatGPT availability in the EU: ChatGPT is already widely available in most countries, including many EU nations. However, there have been some regulatory challenges in the EU, such as the temporary ban in Italy. Despite these challenges, OpenAI has shown a commitment to addressing privacy and regulatory concerns. Given that we're looking at a timeframe until June 30, 2024, which is more than a year away, it's highly likely that OpenAI will have resolved any remaining issues and made ChatGPT generally available in the EU by then. The EU is a significant market, and OpenAI has strong incentives to comply with regulations to maintain access.

They have published numerous papers on AI safety and have been transparent about their research. However, the question specifically asks about external red-teaming results. While internal safety assessments are common, external red-teaming is less frequent. Given the increasing focus on AI safety and the potential for new regulations, there's a good chance that DeepMind will conduct and publish external red-teaming results by June 2024. However, they might also choose to keep such results private or conduct only internal assessments.

(a) Google DeepMind publishing a report on external red-teaming: Google DeepMind has been increasingly transparent about their AI development and safety measures. They have a history of publishing research and reports on AI safety. Given the growing importance of AI safety and the pressure on tech companies to demonstrate responsible AI development, it's quite likely that DeepMind will conduct external red-teaming and publish the results within the given timeframe. However, the specific requirement of external red-teaming and a public report adds some uncertainty. (b) OpenAI's ChatGPT being generally available in the EU: This is a more complex issue due to the ongoing regulatory challenges in the EU regarding AI. The EU is working on comprehensive AI regulations, which could potentially impact the availability of AI services like ChatGPT. However, several factors suggest that ChatGPT is likely to be generally available in the EU by June 30, 2024: 1. OpenAI has shown a willingness to work with regulators and adapt their products to meet legal requirements. 2. The EU's AI Act is still in development and may not be fully implemented by the given date. 3. Even if regulations are in place, OpenAI is likely to adapt ChatGPT to comply with EU requirements rather than completely withdrawing from such a large market. 4. OpenAI has already taken steps to address privacy concerns in the EU, such as offering a GDPR-compliant version of ChatGPT. Considering both parts, the likelihood of at least one of these events occurring by June 30, 2024, is quite high. The ChatGPT availability in the EU seems more likely than the DeepMind report, but either one would suffice for a YES resolution."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.20894067906222813, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Competition: The NBA is highly competitive, with several strong teams like the Denver Nuggets, Boston Celtics, Milwaukee Bucks, and Golden State Warriors. These teams have more established stars and recent playoff success. 4. Historical performance: The Orlando Magic have never won an NBA championship in their franchise history. They have only made it to the NBA Finals twice (1995 and 2009), both resulting in losses. 5. Time for improvement: There is still time between now and the 2024 NBA Finals for the team to improve, make trades, or develop their young core.

Eastern Conference competition: Even if the Magic improve significantly, they would need to overcome strong Eastern Conference teams like the Bucks, Celtics, and Philadelphia 76ers to reach the Finals. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the Orlando Magic will win the 2024 NBA Finals.

ICC's jurisdiction: The ICC has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute, but Palestine is, which gives the ICC potential jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories. 2. Ongoing investigation: The ICC has already opened an investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories, which includes actions by both Israeli and Palestinian actors. 3. Recent events: The ongoing conflict in Gaza since October 2023 has led to significant civilian casualties and destruction, which has drawn international criticism and calls for investigation into potential war crimes. 4. Precedent: The ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state and high-ranking officials, such as Sudan's Omar al-Bashir, showing willingness to pursue such actions. 5. Political pressure: There is significant international pressure on Israel regarding its actions in Gaza, which could influence the ICC's decision-making process. 6. Time frame: The question gives approximately 17 months for this to occur, which is a relatively short time for the ICC to complete its investigation and issue warrants, given the complex nature of the situation. 7. Israeli opposition: Israel strongly opposes ICC jurisdiction and is likely to challenge any attempts to prosecute its leaders, potentially slowing down the process. 8. Specific individuals: The question focuses on three high-ranking Israeli officials who are directly involved in decision-making regarding military operations in Gaza. 9. ICC's caution: The ICC tends to be cautious in issuing arrest warrants for sitting leaders of states, especially those with powerful allies, to avoid political backlash. Given these factors, while there is a real possibility of the ICC issuing arrest warrants, there are also significant obstacles and complexities that make it less than likely within the given timeframe. The ICC's investigations and legal processes often take years, and the political sensitivities surrounding this case may further slow the process. However, the severity of the current conflict and the international outcry do increase the chances of expedited action by the ICC.

Currently, Donald Trump is the overwhelming frontrunner for the Republican nomination, with other candidates like Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley trailing far behind.

The probability of Hurd becoming the nominee is very small, likely less than 1%. (b) Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial: The hush money trial, related to payments made to Stormy Daniels, is a significant legal challenge for Donald Trump. While defendants often choose not to testify in criminal trials to avoid self-incrimination, Trump has a history of being outspoken and desiring to defend himself publicly. He might see testifying as an opportunity to present his side of the story directly to the jury and the public. However, his lawyers would likely advise against it due to the risks involved. The decision will ultimately depend on the trial strategy and Trump's personal inclination.

However, his approval ratings have been relatively low, and there are concerns about his age and performance. The economy and other factors could significantly influence public opinion by July 2024. FiveThirtyEight's projections are typically based on aggregated polls and other data, which can change rapidly. Given these factors, it's difficult to predict with certainty, but Biden has a reasonable chance of being the favorite, perhaps around 60%. (b) Tim Scott not being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Tim Scott is not currently considered a frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are currently seen as the leading contenders. While Scott has gained some attention, he lacks the national profile and support base of other potential candidates. The likelihood of Scott not being the nominee is quite high, perhaps around 95%.

Tim Scott being the Republican nominee: Tim Scott is currently a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, he is not considered a frontrunner at this time. The current frontrunners are Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, with several other candidates also in the race. While Scott has some support, it seems unlikely that he will secure the nomination given the current political landscape and polling data. I would estimate the probability of Scott becoming the nominee at around 5%. 2. 538 projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This part is more challenging to predict as it's over a year away and many factors can influence the election forecast. However, we can consider some key points: a) Biden is the incumbent president, which historically provides an advantage. b) The economy and other major issues will play a significant role in public opinion. c) Trump, if he becomes the Republican nominee, has a strong base but also high unfavorability ratings. d) Biden's age and approval ratings have been concerns for his re-election prospects. Given these factors, it's reasonable to think that the race could be close. However, as the incumbent, Biden might have a slight edge. I would estimate the probability of 538 projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024, at around 55%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs.

The tennis condition alone provides a reasonable chance of the question resolving YES. Even if no single player wins multiple medals, we still have the team sport condition as a backup. 2. The team sport condition also provides a good chance of a YES resolution. With eight sports, the probability of eight different nations winning is lower than the probability of at least one nation winning multiple golds. 3. We only need one of these conditions to be met for a YES resolution, which significantly increases the overall probability. Given these factors, I believe there is a high likelihood of this question resolving as YES. While it's not a certainty, the combination of two separate conditions, each with a reasonable chance of occurring, makes a YES resolution more likely than not."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.21139344756234513, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current polling trends: As of July 2023, Trump has been leading Biden in many national polls, but the margin varies. 2. Time until the election: The poll date in question (July 15, 2024) is very close to the election, which means the polls are likely to be more accurate and stable than they are now. 3. Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents often face challenges in re-election bids, especially if the economy or other major issues are not favorable. 4. Political climate: The political landscape can change dramatically in a year, influenced by events, policy decisions, and public perception. 5. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points, which means small leads are often statistically insignificant. 6. 538's methodology: 538 is known for its rigorous polling aggregation and weighting system, which tends to smooth out outliers and produce a more stable average. Given these factors, it's plausible that Trump could maintain a lead over Biden, but the specific range of >2 and \u22643 points is quite narrow. Here's why I think this specific outcome is possible but not highly likely: - Trump's current lead in some polls suggests he could maintain an advantage. - The narrow range (>2 and \u22643) requires a very specific outcome, which reduces the probability. - As we get closer to the election, polls tend to tighten, making a lead of this size less likely. - 538's averaging method might smooth out more extreme leads, making this range more plausible than a larger lead. - However, a lot can change in a year, and Biden (as the incumbent) might regain ground.

The question is asking about a change over the next week, which is a very short period in political forecasting. 3. Nate Silver's model: Silver's models are known for their robustness and resistance to short-term fluctuations. Significant changes in a week are uncommon unless major events occur. 4. Political landscape: Without specific information about upcoming events or developments, it's unlikely that Harris's position would change dramatically in just one week. 5. Incumbent advantage: As the sitting Vice President, Harris might benefit from the incumbent advantage, which could provide some stability to her numbers. 6.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for him to step aside, he and his team have consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running.

(b) Kamala Harris's odds not increasing according to Nate Silver's model: This part is more uncertain. Harris's current standing in polls and electoral predictions is not particularly strong. However, if Biden were to unexpectedly drop out, it's likely that Harris's odds would increase significantly, at least in the short term, as she would be seen as the most likely successor to Biden for the Democratic nomination. The combination of these two events happening together is extremely improbable. If Biden were to make the shocking announcement that he's not accepting the nomination (which is already very unlikely), it would almost certainly cause an immediate boost to Harris's chances in any electoral model, including Nate Silver's.

(b) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the nomination: Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He has already launched his campaign and is actively fundraising. For him to suddenly announce he won't accept the nomination would be a dramatic reversal. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for him to step aside, he and his team have remained firm in their commitment to run. Such an announcement would be highly unexpected, especially given the relatively short timeframe (by July 15, 2024). However, we must consider that unexpected events can occur in politics. Health issues, unforeseen scandals, or a significant shift in public opinion could potentially lead to such a decision. While unlikely, it's not entirely impossible. Combining these factors, the probability of either event occurring is low. The timeframe is relatively short for such significant changes to occur, and both scenarios would require substantial deviations from the current political trajectory.

(a) 538 projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: As of now (July 2023), it's still early to predict with high certainty how 538 will project the race in July 2024. However, we can consider some factors: 1. Incumbency advantage: Historically, incumbent presidents have an advantage in elections. 2. Current polling: Recent polls have shown a close race between Biden and Trump, with some giving Biden a slight edge. 3. Economic factors: The state of the economy in mid-2024 will play a crucial role. 4. Potential unforeseen events: Scandals, international crises, or other major events could sway public opinion. Given these factors, I'd say there's a moderate chance that 538 will project Biden as the favorite, perhaps around 60%.

The 25th Amendment has never been invoked to remove a president involuntarily. While there have been concerns about Biden's age and occasional gaffes, there's no concrete evidence of incapacitation. His administration and party have shown no signs of considering such a drastic measure. The probability of this occurring is very low, perhaps around 1-2%. 2. FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This is more likely but still uncertain. As of now (July 2023), Biden's approval ratings are low, and there are concerns about his age and performance. However, he's the incumbent president and likely Democratic nominee. The Republican field is still uncertain, with Trump facing legal challenges. Historical trends show that incumbents often have an advantage. FiveThirtyEight's projections can change rapidly based on new information, polls, and events. Given these factors, the probability of Biden being projected as the favorite on that specific date is around 50-60%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves YES if either of these events occurs.

(a) Donald Trump as Republican nominee: As of now, Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

However, there are several factors that could potentially hinder his nomination: 1. Ongoing legal issues and investigations 2. Potential emergence of strong alternative candidates 3. Possible shifts in Republican Party dynamics. Despite these challenges, Trump's popularity among Republican voters remains high, and he has a significant advantage over other potential candidates. Given his current position and historical precedent of parties often nominating previous nominees, I would estimate the probability of Trump becoming the Republican nominee at around 70-75%. (b) BSE SENSEX closing value: Predicting the exact value of a stock market index more than a year in advance is extremely difficult and subject to numerous unpredictable factors. The BSE SENSEX is currently (as of 2023) trading around 65,000-66,000 points. For it to be between 75,000 and 77,000 on a specific date (July 21, 2024) would require: 1. Significant overall growth in the Indian economy 2. Positive investor sentiment 3. No major global economic disruptions. While the Indian economy has shown strong growth potential, predicting such a specific range on a particular date is highly uncertain.

(a) At least 20 House/Senate Democrats signing a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early: The context provided suggests there is significant discontent among House Democrats regarding the DNC's plan to nominate Biden early. Rep. Jared Huffman is circulating a draft letter, and the article mentions 'scores' of members being unsettled about Biden's candidacy. This indicates a substantial base of potential signatories. However, there are some factors that might limit the number of signatories: 1. The deadline is relatively short (by July 21st). 2.

There could be strategic disagreements about the timing of the nomination. 3. Some Democrats in competitive districts might want to distance themselves from Biden for electoral reasons. However, the likelihood of 20 or more elected Democrats publicly opposing the party's strategy is still low.

Iran and Israel have a history of tensions, but direct military confrontations are rare. Iran typically operates through proxy forces rather than direct military action against Israel. The international community would likely try to prevent such an escalation. However, the current geopolitical climate is volatile, and unexpected events can occur. Given these factors, I estimate the probability of this event occurring to be low, around 0.15 or 15%. (b) Donald Trump not testifying at the hush money trial: Trump has a history of avoiding direct testimony in legal proceedings. His legal team may advise against testifying due to potential risks. However, the trial is high-profile, and Trump might see it as an opportunity to defend himself publicly.

Donald Trump testifying at the hush money trial: The trial is scheduled to begin on March 25, 2024, and is expected to last several weeks. While it's common for defendants in high-profile cases to testify, Trump has a history of avoiding direct testimony in legal proceedings. He has often preferred to give written statements or have his lawyers speak on his behalf. However, given the nature of this case and its potential impact on his political future, there's a possibility he might choose to testify to directly address the allegations.

Iran initiating a military response before August 13th: The timeframe for this part is from July 30 to August 12, 2024. Iran-Israel relations have been tense for years, but direct military confrontation has been rare. Iran typically operates through proxy forces rather than engaging in direct attacks. However, recent events, such as Israel's alleged involvement in attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, have escalated tensions. Still, Iran is generally cautious about direct military confrontation with Israel due to potential international repercussions and the risk of a wider conflict. The probability of Iran initiating a direct military action against Israel in this specific timeframe seems low, perhaps around 10-15%. Combining these probabilities: The question resolves as YES if either event occurs. To calculate the probability of at least one of these events happening, we use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).

The financial and organizational commitment required for participation can be a deterrent for smaller countries like Luxembourg.

Slovenia has been a regular participant and has qualified for the final 6 times out of 25 appearances since 1993, giving it a historical qualification rate of about 24%. 2. Current participation status: As of now, Luxembourg has not announced any plans to return to Eurovision in 2024. Slovenia is likely to participate as it has been a regular contestant in recent years. 3. Competition format: Typically, 10 countries qualify from each semi-final, out of about 16-18 participants per semi-final. This gives each participating country roughly a 55-60% chance of qualifying, assuming equal competitiveness. 4. Recent performance: Slovenia qualified for the final in 2023 with the song 'Carpe Diem' by Joker Out, which may boost their confidence and potentially lead to a stronger entry in 2024. 5. Unpredictability factor: Eurovision results can be unpredictable due to various factors like song quality, performance, political voting, and changing tastes. Considering these factors, the probability largely depends on Slovenia's performance, as Luxembourg's participation is uncertain. If we assume Slovenia participates (which is likely), based on their historical qualification rate and recent success, they have a moderate chance of qualifying. However, this is slightly lower than the average qualification rate due to their inconsistent past performance.

Music industry strength: Norway has a robust music industry that consistently produces high-quality pop music, which translates well to the Eurovision stage. 7.

However, he is considered a long-shot candidate.

Given the current political landscape and polling data, the probability of Hurd securing the nomination is extremely low. 2. Joe Biden announcing before July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination: Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. It's highly unusual for an incumbent president to drop out of the race, especially this far in advance. The July 15, 2024 deadline is also before the Democratic National Convention, which typically occurs in August or September. For Biden to make such an announcement, there would likely need to be a significant change in circumstances, such as a major health issue.

Some states might attempt this, especially given the ongoing investigations and legal troubles Trump faces.

Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024: Elon Musk is known for his interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Dogecoin, but has had a complex relationship with Bitcoin. He doesn't attend every crypto conference, and his schedule is likely to be very busy with his various companies. However, given that this is a major Bitcoin conference, and Musk's companies (particularly Tesla) have had involvement with Bitcoin, there's a chance he might attend. But it's more likely he won't, given his numerous commitments and the fact that he doesn't regularly attend such conferences.

(a) Elon Musk appearing at Bitcoin Nashville 2024: Elon Musk has shown interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Dogecoin, in the past. However, his attendance at specific crypto conferences is not consistent. Bitcoin Nashville is a significant event, but it's not as prominent as some other crypto conferences. Musk's schedule is often unpredictable, and his interests can shift rapidly. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Musk appearing at this specific conference to be relatively low, around 15%. (b) Donald Trump being removed from any state's primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This is a more complex and contentious issue. There have been discussions and some legal attempts to use the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running for office due to his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot. However, as of now, no state has successfully removed him from a ballot on these grounds. The legal hurdles for such an action are significant, and it would likely face intense legal challenges.

Potential for opposition unity: If opposition parties manage to form a united front, they could pose a more significant challenge. 2.

This is within the range we're looking at (between 2 and 3 points), but there's still over a week for this to change. 2. Historical volatility: Presidential polling averages tend to fluctuate, but major shifts usually occur due to significant events or debates. Without knowing of any scheduled events between July 5 and July 15, we might expect relatively minor changes. 3. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points.

Their methodology tends to smooth out extreme fluctuations. Given that Trump's lead is already at 2.4 points on July 5, it's quite plausible that it could remain within the 2 to 3 point range by July 15.

Competition: The strength of other countries' entries in Czechia's semi-final will affect their chances of qualifying. This information is not available yet. 5. Voting system: Eurovision uses a combination of jury and public votes. Czechia's ability to appeal to both groups will be crucial. 6. Geopolitical factors: While not supposed to influence voting, regional alliances and diaspora voting can play a role. Czechia doesn't have strong voting allies, which could be a disadvantage. 7. Participation confirmation: As of now, we don't have confirmation that Czechia will participate in Eurovision 2024, though it's likely they will. Given these factors, Czechia's chances of qualifying are somewhat uncertain. Their recent improvement in qualification (2 out of 3 years from 2021-2023) is encouraging, but their overall history and lack of strong voting allies work against them. Without knowing the specifics of their 2024 entry or the competition they'll face, it's difficult to be highly confident in either direction.

Current polling trends: As of the question's creation date (April 13, 2024), Trump has a 2.4-point lead over Biden. This suggests that Trump is currently favored, but the margin is relatively small. 2. Time until the resolution date: There are approximately three months between the question's creation and the resolution date. This is a significant amount of time in politics, during which many events could occur to shift public opinion. 3. Historical polling volatility: Presidential polls tend to fluctuate, especially as the election draws closer. A 2-3 point lead is within the typical range of fluctuation. 4. Campaign dynamics: Both candidates will likely intensify their campaigning efforts as the election approaches, which could impact polling numbers. 5. External factors: Unforeseen events, such as economic changes, international incidents, or scandals, could significantly influence polling numbers. 6.

Given these factors, it's plausible that Trump's lead could fall within the 2-3 point range on July 15, 2024. However, there are also many scenarios where it could be outside this range: - Trump's lead could increase beyond 3 points if he gains momentum or if Biden faces significant challenges. - Trump's lead could decrease below 2 points or even flip to a Biden lead if current trends reverse or if Biden's campaign gains traction. The narrow range specified (greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3) makes this outcome less likely than if we were considering a broader range of Trump leading in general.

Current market conditions: As of April 2024, the market has been experiencing relatively low volatility due to a stable economic environment and clear monetary policy direction from the Federal Reserve. 2. Historical trends: The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index tends to fluctuate based on economic cycles, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. However, it's important to note that volatility is mean-reverting, meaning it tends to return to its average level over time. 3. Upcoming events: The U.S. presidential election in November 2024 could potentially increase market volatility as we approach July 2024, due to uncertainty about future economic policies. 4. Economic forecasts: Most economists predict a relatively stable economic environment for 2024, which typically corresponds to lower volatility. However, unexpected events can always occur. 5. Comparison to July 2023: We would need to know the exact value of the index on July 20, 2023, to make a more accurate prediction. Without this information, we're working with more uncertainty. 6.

Given these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher chance that the volatility index will be lower rather than higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024. The main reasons for this are: a) The current low volatility environment is likely to persist in the absence of major economic shocks. b) The market may have already priced in the uncertainty surrounding the 2024 U.S. election by July. c) The mean-reverting nature of volatility suggests that if we're currently in a low volatility period, it's more likely to stay low or increase only slightly.

Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024: The Israel-Iran conflict has been ongoing for years, with both countries engaging in covert operations and cyber attacks. Israel has previously conducted operations in Iran, including alleged assassinations and sabotage of nuclear facilities. However, a direct, overt attack by Israel on Iranian soil leading to at least five deaths would be a significant escalation. Such an attack could potentially trigger a wider regional conflict, which Israel might want to avoid. The timeframe (until May 1, 2024) is relatively short, reducing the likelihood of such a major event occurring. Estimated probability: 0.15 2. CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) not being higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024: Volatility indices are generally mean-reverting, meaning they tend to return to average levels over time. The current geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties could lead to higher volatility in the near term. However, by July 2024, many current uncertainties may have resolved, potentially leading to lower volatility.

Predicting this index a year in advance is challenging due to the many factors that can influence market volatility. However, we can consider some key points: 1. Current economic conditions: As of April 2024, there are ongoing concerns about inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth. 2. Historical trends: Volatility indices tend to revert to their mean over time, but can spike during periods of uncertainty. 3.

Recent events: The conflict between Israel and Hamas (which is supported by Iran) has escalated tensions in the region. 3. Time frame: The window for this event to occur is relatively short (less than three weeks from the question's creation date). 4. International pressure: Global powers may try to prevent further escalation in the region. While the possibility of such an attack exists, the short time frame and potential international consequences make it less likely.

(a) \"Twisters\" (2024) Rotten Tomatoes score: \"Twisters\" is a sequel to a popular 90s disaster film, which could generate nostalgia and interest. However, sequels often struggle to match the quality of their predecessors. The original \"Twister\" has a 63% Tomatometer score, which is decent but not exceptional. On the positive side, the film is directed by Lee Isaac Chung, who received critical acclaim for \"Minari.\" This suggests a potentially more nuanced approach to the disaster genre. The cast, including Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar Jones, is also promising and could elevate the material. However, disaster movies often prioritize spectacle over critical acclaim, and they can be hit-or-miss with critics. Achieving a 75% or higher score is a high bar, especially for this genre.

Donald Trump remains the frontrunner by a large margin in most polls. While Haley has gained some momentum and financial support, overtaking Trump seems unlikely given his strong base within the party. However, there's always a possibility of unexpected events that could change the race dynamics. Probability for this scenario: approximately 0.10 or 10%. 2. Joe Biden still being president by the end of July 2024: This scenario is much more likely. Joe Biden is the incumbent president and, barring any extraordinary circumstances, is expected to remain in office until at least the end of his current term (January 20, 2025). The only realistic ways he wouldn't be president by the end of July 2024 are: a) Resignation: This seems highly unlikely given Biden's commitment to his role. b) Impeachment and removal: While there have been calls for impeachment from some Republicans, the process is complex and requires a supermajority in the Senate, which is improbable given the current political landscape. c) Health issues or death: While Biden is of advanced age, he appears to be in relatively good health for his age. Given these factors, the probability of Biden remaining president until the end of July 2024 is very high, approximately 0.95 or 95%.

Rep. Jared Huffman is circulating a draft letter, and he mentions that 'scores' of Democrats are unsettled about Biden's candidacy.

However, there are several factors to consider: - The deadline for this to happen is July 21st, which gives limited time for organization and consensus-building. - Publicly opposing the party's plan could be seen as divisive and potentially damaging to the party's unity. - Some Democrats, even if they disagree with the plan, might choose not to sign to avoid appearing disloyal to Biden.

Time Frame: The question resolves shortly after the Olympics end, so we will have a definitive answer based on the actual results.

In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), Russian athletes competing as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) won 20 gold medals. However, the Paris 2024 Olympics may have stricter regulations on Russian and Belarusian participation. The IOC has recommended allowing individual athletes from these countries to compete as neutrals, but with limitations. This could potentially reduce their medal count compared to previous Olympics. 2. No athlete winning at least two medals for tennis: In Olympic tennis, there are five events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. It's common for top players to compete in both singles and doubles events, increasing their chances of winning multiple medals. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, several players won multiple medals in tennis, including Belinda Bencic (gold in singles, silver in doubles) and Andrey Rublev (gold in mixed doubles, bronze in men's doubles). Considering these factors: 1. The 21+ gold medal target for INA seems challenging, especially with potential restrictions on participation. While not impossible, it's less likely than in previous Olympics. 2. The condition of no athlete winning multiple tennis medals is also unlikely. Top players often compete in multiple events, and historically, it's common for at least one player to win medals in both singles and doubles. For both conditions to be met simultaneously, we would need an exceptionally strong performance from INA athletes across various sports, while also having an unusual tennis tournament where no player excels in multiple events.

It's not uncommon for top players to compete in multiple events, increasing their chances of winning multiple medals. However, the competition is fierce, and winning multiple medals is challenging. In recent Olympics, we've seen some players achieve this feat (e.g., Andy Murray in 2016), but it's not a frequent occurrence. The probability of this happening is moderate. b) Individual Neutral Athletes winning \u226521 gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics: This condition is highly unlikely. 'Individual Neutral Athletes' typically refers to athletes from countries that are banned from competing under their national flag due to doping or other violations. In recent Olympics, Russian athletes have competed under this status. However, winning 21 or more gold medals as a group is an extremely high bar. For context, at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee (competing under a neutral flag) won only 20 gold medals total, and they were the third-highest ranking country. It's improbable that a group of neutral athletes would surpass this performance significantly. Combining these factors: The first condition (tennis player winning multiple medals) has a moderate chance of occurring, while the second condition (neutral athletes winning \u226521 golds) is highly unlikely. Since only one of these needs to occur for a YES resolution, the overall probability is primarily driven by the more likely tennis scenario.

Let's break it down: 1. Kamala Harris being nominated as the Democratic VP: This is highly likely. As the incumbent Vice President, Harris has a strong position within the Democratic Party. Historically, incumbent VPs are rarely replaced when a president runs for re-election. Biden has consistently expressed support for Harris, and replacing her could be seen as a sign of weakness or disunity within the party. Therefore, the probability of Harris being renominated is very high, perhaps around 90-95%. 2. Trump's lead over Biden being \u22642 or >4 on July 15, 2024: This is more uncertain. Current polls show a close race between Trump and Biden, but a lot can change by July 2024. The condition allows for two scenarios: a close race (lead \u22642) or a significant Trump lead (>4). This covers a wide range of possibilities, excluding only a moderate Trump lead (between 2 and 4 points) or any Biden lead. Given the polarized nature of US politics and historical polling trends, it's quite possible that the race will either be very close or show a more significant lead for one candidate. The exclusion of a Biden lead reduces the probability somewhat, but the two allowed scenarios still cover a substantial range of outcomes. Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability of the second condition being met at around 60-70%. For both events to occur, we multiply their probabilities: 0.90 (Harris nomination) * 0.65 (Trump lead condition) \u2248 0.585.

(a) Trump's lead over Biden: As of July 2024, the political landscape in the US is likely to be highly volatile. While Trump has been leading in some polls, a lead of exactly between 2 and 4 points is a relatively narrow range. Historical data shows that polling averages can fluctuate significantly, especially months before an election. Additionally, 538's polling average is known for its accuracy and frequent updates, which means it's responsive to new information and events. However, given Trump's consistent performance in recent polls and the challenges facing the Biden administration (such as concerns over the economy and Biden's age), it's not implausible that Trump could have a lead in this specific range. Still, pinpointing such a precise lead on a specific date is challenging. (b) Kamala Harris as Democratic VP: This part is much more likely to occur. Kamala Harris is the incumbent Vice President, and it's extremely rare for a sitting president to change their running mate when seeking re-election. The last time this happened was in 1976 when Gerald Ford replaced Nelson Rockefeller with Bob Dole. Barring any unforeseen circumstances or major scandals, it's highly probable that Biden will keep Harris as his running mate. The Democratic party would likely want to avoid the appearance of instability or lack of confidence in their ticket by changing the VP nominee.

Recent polls show Trump with around 50-60% support among Republican voters, while DeSantis typically has 15-25%.

The probability of a sudden health event or voluntary resignation is relatively low for any sitting president. Historically, only 8 out of 45 presidents have died in office, and only 1 has resigned.

While DeSantis has gained popularity and support within the Republican party, Trump still maintains a strong base of supporters. Recent polls have shown Trump leading DeSantis in potential primary matchups. However, the political landscape can change rapidly, and DeSantis has time to gain more support before the Republican National Convention. Given that this question resolves YES if either of these events occurs, we need to consider the combined probability. Even if DeSantis doesn't secure the nomination, there's a high chance of a YES resolution due to Biden likely remaining in office.

Considering these factors: Scenario (a) has a moderate but not high probability, perhaps around 20-30%. Scenario (b) has a very high probability, likely over 95%. Since the question asks if EITHER of these will occur, we need to combine these probabilities. The probability of at least one of these events occurring is higher than either individual probability. Given the high likelihood of Biden remaining president, which almost guarantees a 'YES' resolution regardless of the polling scenario, the overall probability is very high."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09688360977659481, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.03229453659219827, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44814723659031075, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

As an incumbent president likely running for re-election, Biden may be more inclined to do longer, in-depth interviews to reach voters and address important issues. 4. Media strategy: While Biden has been known to be somewhat cautious with media appearances, a long-form interview could be seen as an opportunity to showcase his policies, achievements, and vision for the future in a controlled environment. 5. Potential venues: There are numerous potential venues for such an interview, including podcasts, late-night shows, and news programs like 60 Minutes (although the latter would need to feature at least 45 minutes of new footage to qualify). 6. Biden's age and stamina: At 80 years old (81 by July 2024), there might be concerns about Biden's ability to sustain a 45+ minute interview. However, he has demonstrated the capacity to do so in the past. 7. Campaign demands: As the election approaches, Biden's schedule will likely become increasingly busy, which could either limit opportunities for long interviews or create more demand for such appearances to reach voters. Given these factors, I believe there is a good chance that Biden will participate in at least one qualifying interview before the end of July 2024. The long time frame, the importance of media exposure during an election year, and the precedent set by his previous long-form interviews all contribute to this likelihood.

The timeframe (until end of July 2024) is relatively long, increasing the chances of such an interview occurring.

Will at least 20 House/Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early? This scenario seems quite plausible given the current political climate: - There's already a draft letter circulating, initiated by Rep. Jared Huffman. - The article mentions 'dozens' of House Democrats are organizing this effort. - There's significant internal debate about Biden's candidacy within the Democratic Party. - The recent attempted assassination of Trump may have heightened concerns about the nomination process. However, there are some factors that might reduce the likelihood: - The deadline is relatively soon (July 21st). - Some Democrats might be hesitant to publicly oppose the party leadership. - There could be behind-the-scenes efforts to address concerns without a public letter. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of this part happening at around 60%. 2. Will Democrats have a brokered convention in 2024? This scenario is less likely: - Brokered conventions are rare in modern politics. - Biden is the incumbent president, which typically ensures a smooth nomination process. - The DNC is actively trying to secure Biden's nomination early. - There are no strong alternative candidates currently challenging Biden. However, there are some factors that could increase the likelihood: - Biden's age and perceived electability concerns. - Potential last-minute entries by other candidates. - Unforeseen events that could dramatically change the political landscape. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of a brokered convention at around 10%. Combining these probabilities, we need to calculate the likelihood of at least one of these events occurring.

Season finales: The season 1 finale (E10) was rated 9.2, significantly above 8.5. This suggests that finales tend to be well-received. 3. Recent trend: Season 2 has shown more volatility in ratings, with a significant drop in the last two episodes (7.6 and 6.1). This could indicate a decline in viewer satisfaction or controversial plot developments. 4. Finale expectations: Season finales often feature major plot developments, climactic moments, and resolutions, which can lead to higher ratings if executed well. 5. Time for rating stabilization: The two-day window after release allows for a more settled rating, as initial reactions may be more extreme. 6. Viewer engagement: Finales typically draw more viewers and engagement, which can lead to more ratings being submitted. Given these factors, there are arguments for both sides: Positive factors: - Season finales tend to be highly rated (as seen in Season 1) - Finales often feature significant events that can excite viewers - Two days allow for a more balanced rating Negative factors: - Recent episodes have shown a downward trend in ratings - Season 2 has been more inconsistent in quality according to ratings - Only 1 out of 6 episodes in Season 2 has exceeded 8.5 so far Considering all these points, I believe there's a moderate chance the finale will be rated above 8.5.

In recent Olympics, Russian athletes have competed as neutral athletes due to the country's doping scandal. At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (held in 2021), the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) athletes, competing as neutrals, won 20 gold medals. However, the situation for Paris 2024 is different. Due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes are currently banned from competing even as neutral athletes. The IOC has suggested they might allow some Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals, but under very strict conditions.

In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes competing as the Russian Olympic Committee won 20 gold medals.

Time until resolution: The question asks about the situation on July 30, 2024, which is more than a year away from the current date. This long timeframe increases uncertainty. 3. French political system: The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and can be changed at any time, without requiring elections. 4. Recent political trends: France has seen increasing political fragmentation and the rise of new political movements in recent years. 5. Potential for political shifts: Given the dynamic nature of French politics, there's a possibility of coalition changes or reshuffles within the existing government. 6. Historical precedent: French governments have sometimes undergone significant changes between elections, including changes in coalition alignments. 7. Upcoming events: There are no scheduled national elections in France before the resolution date, which reduces the likelihood of major political shifts. Given these factors, it seems more likely that the current coalition ('Together') will still be in power on July 30, 2024. The timeframe, while long enough to allow for changes, is not so long that a major shift is highly probable. The absence of scheduled elections also favors stability. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of a change. Political crises, scandals, or significant policy disagreements could lead to a reshuffling of the government or a change in coalitions. The rise of new political movements or realignments of existing parties could also potentially lead to a new coalition forming.

(a) Regarding the ID political group holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections: The Identity and Democracy (ID) group is a far-right, Eurosceptic political group in the European Parliament. Currently, they are the fifth-largest group in the European Parliament. While there has been a rise in populist and far-right sentiment in some European countries, it's still a significant leap for them to become the largest group. The current largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), which have traditionally dominated EU politics. For ID to become the largest group, they would need to dramatically increase their seat count while other major parties lose seats. While there's potential for growth in ID's support, it's unlikely they'll surpass the established centrist parties. I'd estimate the probability of ID holding the most seats at around 0.15 or 15%. (b) Regarding the Prime Minister of France belonging to New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024: As of now (2023), the current Prime Minister of France, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, belongs to the Renaissance party, which is part of the 'Ensemble' (Together) coalition. The 'Together' coalition currently holds power in France. However, French politics can be volatile, and there's a possibility of change before July 2024. The New Popular Front (likely referring to the NUPES alliance) is a left-wing coalition that performed well in the 2022 legislative elections. Given that the current government is from the 'Together' coalition, and considering the strength of both 'Together' and the New Popular Front, I'd estimate the probability of the Prime Minister belonging to either of these groups at around 0.7 or 70%.

The next French legislative elections are not scheduled until 2027, so barring any unforeseen circumstances, it's unlikely that there will be a change in the ruling coalition by July 30, 2024. However, French politics can be volatile, and there's always a possibility of a government reshuffle or a vote of no confidence.

(b) Regarding the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections: The ID (Identity and Democracy) group is currently the fifth-largest group in the European Parliament. While right-wing and populist parties have been gaining ground in various European countries, it would be a significant shift for the ID group to become the largest in the European Parliament. The current largest groups (EPP, S&D) have a substantial lead over ID. However, political landscapes can change, and there's growing support for right-wing parties in some countries. Combining these factors: For (a), I estimate a relatively low probability of a change in the French Prime Minister's coalition, perhaps around 20%. For (b), the probability of ID becoming the largest group is also low, but given the rising populist sentiment in Europe, it might be around 15%.

Recent trends: Both countries have shown improvement in their qualification rates in recent years. 3.

Quality of entries: While we don't know the specific songs for 2024 yet, both countries have been sending competitive entries in recent years. 6.
