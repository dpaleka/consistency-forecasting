Recent performances: Since Bolt's retirement, no sprinter has consistently come close to his world record of 9.58 seconds or the Olympic record of 9.63 seconds. 3. Top contenders: The current crop of elite sprinters includes athletes like Christian Coleman, Trayvon Bromell, and Fred Kerley, who have personal bests around 9.76-9.84 seconds. 4. Progression of records: Olympic records in sprinting events tend to be broken infrequently, as it requires exceptional performance under high-pressure conditions. 5. Time frame: The question is specifically about the 2024 Paris Olympics, which doesn't allow much time for significant improvements in human performance. 6. Environmental factors: Paris in summer might not provide ideal conditions for sprinting (compared to warmer, more humid climates that can be favorable for fast times). 7. Doping controls: Strict anti-doping measures in place make it less likely for athletes to achieve extraordinary performances through illegal means. 8. Margin for improvement: The current record is already very close to the limits of human capability, making it increasingly difficult to improve upon. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that the Olympic record will be broken in Paris 2024. While there are several world-class sprinters who could potentially challenge the record, the combination of the high bar set by Bolt, the relatively short timeframe for improvement, and the specific conditions of the Paris Olympics make it improbable that we'll see a time faster than 9.63 seconds.

This seems achievable, especially if there's increased interest due to the 'shenanigans' mentioned. - The existence of this meta-market about the original market's trader count could create a feedback loop, driving more participants to the original market. - However, growth often slows down as markets mature, so it might be harder to attract new traders as time goes on. - The short time frame (11 days) adds some uncertainty and pressure to reach the goal. Considering these points, I believe there's a good chance the market will reach 377 traders, but it's not certain. The 'market shenanigans' and meta-market effect could provide the boost needed to reach the goal, but the short time frame and potential slowdown in growth rate create some doubt."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "ff79007e-6149-49b0-b856-7c0e3093ef3a", "title": "Will the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 16?", "body": "Sorry to my extremely loyal followers, I\u2019ve become embroiled in some market shenanigans, so I\u2019m making this market.\n\n(https://manifold.markets/embed/Mira_/how-many-traders-will-this-market-g)Resolves YES if the market embedded above has 377 traders before market close (July 16, 11:59 PM Pacific Time).

Expanding Olympic program: The IOC has been adding new sports and events, which can create opportunities for countries to excel in niche areas.

Development of sports programs: Many countries have been investing in their sports programs, aiming to achieve Olympic success. This ongoing effort increases the chances of new countries breaking through. 5. Randomness and upsets: Olympic competitions can be unpredictable, and underdogs sometimes emerge victorious, leading to surprise medals for less prominent sporting nations. 6. Time frame: The question resolves shortly after the Games conclude, so we will have a definitive answer based on the actual results. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that at least three countries will win their first Olympic medal in Paris 2024. The historical precedent shows that this has happened in recent Games, and with the continued expansion of the Olympic program and the development of sports in various countries, the chances remain high. However, we should also consider that as more countries win their first medals over time, the pool of remaining countries without medals shrinks, potentially making it slightly more challenging for new countries to break through.

Given these factors, I believe there is a possibility of a change in the Prime Minister's affiliation, but it's not highly likely. The current coalition has a strong position, and significant political shifts usually take time. However, the relatively long timeframe until resolution does leave room for potential changes.

Tennis event structure: The Olympics feature singles, doubles, and mixed doubles events. This gives players multiple opportunities to win medals, especially if they participate in more than one event. 3. Dominance of top players: Tennis tends to have dominant players who excel across different formats. Players like Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, or Serena Williams (if she decides to participate) have the potential to win in both singles and doubles. 4. Team strength: Some countries have strong tennis teams, increasing the likelihood of players winning medals in both individual and team events. For instance, players from tennis powerhouses like the USA, Spain, or Serbia might have good chances in multiple events. 5. Short timeframe: The question was created very close to the event (about a week before), which suggests that the current form and fitness of players are likely known, potentially making it easier to predict strong performances. 6. Motivation: Olympic medals are highly valued in tennis, so top players are likely to give their best effort in multiple events if they participate. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that at least one athlete will win more than one medal in tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The multiple event structure and the tendency for top players to excel in different formats make this a probable outcome. However, there are some factors that could reduce the likelihood: 1. Upsets: Tennis can be unpredictable, and favorites don't always win. 2. Scheduling: The tight Olympic schedule might make it challenging for players to perform at their best in multiple events. 3.

However, sequels can be hit or miss with critics. The original 'Twister' has a 63% score, which is decent but not exceptional. 4. Genre: Disaster movies often struggle with critics, as they tend to prioritize spectacle over depth. However, with a critically acclaimed director, there's potential for a more nuanced approach. 5. Studio expectations: Given the high-profile nature of the project, it's likely that significant resources have been invested to ensure quality. 6. Current trends: There's been a recent trend of successful 'legacy sequels' that have performed well critically (e.g., 'Top Gun: Maverick,' 'Blade Runner 2049'). 7. Time since original: The long gap since the original film (28 years) could allow for a fresh take on the concept, potentially appealing to critics. Despite these positive factors, achieving a 75% score is still a high bar. Many good films fall short of this mark. The original's 63% score also suggests that the concept itself might have limitations in critical appeal. Balancing these factors, I believe 'Twisters' has a good chance of critical success, but reaching 75% is not assured. The director's track record and the potential for a fresh take on the concept are the strongest factors in its favor."}}}, "cons_P": {"question": {"id": "be7ec26f-0ed2-4df6-bee1-f9665e3241a9", "title": "Will \"Twisters\" (2024) have a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of at least 70%?", "body": "\"Twisters\" (2024) Rotten Tomatoes page\n\nThis resolves YES if the Tomatometer score is 70% or higher, one week after release (July 26th). \n\nDetails \n\nI will use whatever precision is listed by Rotten Tomatoes (typically an integer percentage, no decimal).\n\nFor example, the original \"Twister\" (1996) currently has a Tomatometer of 63%.

Given these factors, I believe 'Twisters' has a decent chance of receiving positive reviews, but reaching 70% is not guaranteed. The director's previous success and the cast's appeal are positive factors, but the genre and sequel nature present challenges. The original's 63% score provides a baseline, and with Chung's direction, it's reasonable to expect some improvement. However, reaching 70% requires a significant portion of critics to give positive reviews, which is challenging for a disaster movie sequel.

Historical performance: The SENSEX has shown strong growth over the past decades. In recent years, it has often achieved annual returns of 10-15% or more, making a 14-15% increase in a year plausible. 3. Economic outlook: India's economy is projected to continue growing at a robust pace. The IMF forecasts India's GDP growth at 6.1% for 2023 and 6.8% for 2024, which is favorable for the stock market. 4. Global economic factors: Global economic conditions, including inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, can impact the Indian stock market. While there are concerns about global economic slowdown, India's domestic-driven economy might provide some insulation. 5. Government policies: The Indian government's focus on economic reforms and initiatives like 'Make in India' could continue to attract investments and boost the stock market. 6. Market sentiment: Indian markets have shown resilience and optimism, with many analysts bullish on the long-term prospects of the Indian economy and stock market. 7. Potential risks: Factors like global economic downturns, geopolitical tensions, or domestic political issues could negatively impact the market. 8. Time frame: The question's resolution date is about a year from now, which is a relatively long time in stock market terms, allowing for significant movement. Given these factors, there's a good chance the SENSEX could reach 75,000 by July 21, 2024.

Time frame: The question allows for about 3 weeks (from July 28 to August 19) for the results to be published. This is a relatively generous timeframe for vote counting and result publication in most democratic countries. 3. Level of detail required: The question specifies that results must be disaggregated to the parish level. This level of detail might take longer to compile and verify, potentially delaying publication. 4. Political climate: Venezuela's political situation has been turbulent in recent years. Depending on the political climate surrounding this election, there might be pressure to either expedite or delay the publication of results. 5. Technical capacity: The ability of the Venezuelan electoral commission to quickly process and publish detailed results depends on their technical infrastructure and resources, which may have been affected by the country's economic challenges. 6. International scrutiny: Given Venezuela's recent history, there may be significant international attention on this election, which could pressure the government to publish results promptly and transparently. 7. Potential for disputes or recounts: If the election is close or there are allegations of irregularities, this could delay the publication of full results. Considering these factors, it seems that while there is a reasonable chance for the results to be published within the given timeframe, there are also significant potential obstacles. The requirement for parish-level detail and the possibility of political or technical complications add uncertainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical ratings: Looking at the provided ratings, we can see that season finales tend to be highly rated. Season 1 finale (E10) received a 9.2, which is significantly above 8.5. 2. Season 2 performance: Season 2 has been more volatile in terms of ratings compared to Season 1. We've seen both very high (E4: 9.6) and very low (E6: 6.1) ratings. This suggests that the audience reception has been mixed and unpredictable. 3. Trend: The most recent episode (E6) received a very low rating of 6.1, which is concerning. However, season finales often feature major plot developments and climactic events, which tend to boost ratings. 4. Expectations: Being the season finale, there will likely be high expectations from the audience. This can work both ways - if met, it could lead to a high rating, but if not, it might result in disappointment and lower ratings. 5. Time for rating stabilization: The two-day window after release allows time for a more balanced rating to emerge, as both immediate reactions and more considered opinions will be included. 6.

Historical ratings: Looking at the provided ratings, we can see that: - Season 1 finale (E10) scored 9.2 - Season 1 overall had strong ratings, with all episodes above 8.0 - Season 2 has been more volatile, with ratings ranging from 6.1 to 9.6 2. Season finales tend to be significant: Generally, season finales are pivotal episodes that often receive higher ratings due to their importance in the storyline and resolution of plot points. 3. Recent trend: The last few episodes of Season 2 have shown a downward trend (9.6, 7.6, 6.1), which is concerning. 4. Viewer expectations: Given the mixed reception of recent episodes, viewers might have heightened expectations for the finale to 'redeem' the season. 5. Time for rating stabilization: The two-day window after release allows for a more settled rating, reducing the impact of initial extreme reactions. 6. Franchise strength: 'House of the Dragon' is part of the popular Game of Thrones universe, which often garners strong fan engagement. Considering these factors, there are arguments for both sides: Positive factors: - Historical strength of season finales - The show's overall popularity and fan base - Two days for ratings to stabilize, potentially moderating extreme initial reactions Negative factors: - Recent downward trend in ratings - Increased pressure and expectations might lead to disappointment. Given the show's track record and the importance of finales, I believe there's a good chance the episode will rate above 8.0. However, the recent negative trend cannot be ignored.

However, we should consider a few factors that could increase the probability of a debate occurring: 1. Biden's age and health: Concerns about Biden's age (he will be 81 at the start of a second term) could lead to increased pressure for alternative candidates. 2. Unforeseen circumstances: Political scandals, significant policy failures, or health issues could potentially force Biden to withdraw, opening the field for other candidates and necessitating debates. 3. Party division: If there's a significant ideological split within the Democratic party, it could lead to challenges to Biden's candidacy and potentially result in debates. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for a Democratic debate to occur, it seems unlikely. The probability is low, but not zero, as unforeseen circumstances could still lead to such an event."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Political insiders, staffers, or party officials might disclose the information to journalists. 4. Time frame: The question requires at least 6 hours of advance coverage. This is a reasonable timeframe for major news to circulate before an official announcement, especially given the 24/7 news cycle and the speed of modern communications. 5. Verification process: Reputable media outlets typically require multiple sources to confirm such significant news before publishing. Given the magnitude of a presidential candidate dropping out, they would likely work quickly to verify and publish the story. 6. Competition among media outlets: There would be intense competition to break this story first, incentivizing quick reporting once the information is obtained and verified. 7. Biden administration's media strategy: While they would attempt to control the narrative, it would be extremely challenging to keep such a decision completely under wraps until the official announcement. Considering these factors, if Biden were to drop out, it seems highly likely that at least one major media outlet would report on it at least 6 hours in advance.

Historical performance: The BSE SENSEX has shown strong growth over the past decades. In recent years, it has experienced annual growth rates ranging from 15% to 25% in bullish periods. 3. Economic factors: India's economy is one of the fastest-growing major economies globally. Continued economic growth, foreign investments, and government policies supporting businesses could drive the index higher. 4. Global economic conditions: Global economic factors, including US interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and international trade relations, can significantly impact the Indian stock market. 5. Specific range: The question asks for a very narrow range (1,000 points) at a high value, which makes it less likely to occur precisely within this range. 6.

Market volatility: Stock markets can be unpredictable, especially when predicting specific values on a particular date. Given these factors, while it's possible for the BSE SENSEX to reach the 75,000-76,000 range by July 2024, predicting it to close exactly within this 1,000-point range on a specific date is quite challenging.

Tennis event structure: The Olympics feature singles, doubles, and mixed doubles events. This gives players multiple opportunities to win medals, especially if they excel in more than one discipline. 3. Dominance of top players: Tennis tends to have dominant players who perform well across different events. Players like Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, or Serena Williams (if she decides to compete) have the potential to win in both singles and doubles. 4. Team strength: Some countries have strong tennis teams, increasing the likelihood of players partnering for success in doubles events alongside individual achievements. 5. Short timeframe: The question was created very close to the event (about a week before), which suggests that the current form and fitness of players are likely known, potentially increasing the accuracy of this prediction. 6. Motivation: Olympic medals are highly valued in tennis, so top players are likely to give their best effort in multiple events. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that at least one athlete will win more than one medal in tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The multiple event structure and the tendency for top players to compete in more than one discipline significantly increase this probability. However, we must also consider potential obstacles: 1. Upsets: Tennis can be unpredictable, and favorites don't always win. 2. Scheduling: The tight Olympic schedule might make it challenging for players to perform at their best in multiple events. 3.

Planned events: The 2024 Paris Olympics is scheduled to include tennis as one of its sports. There are typically five events in Olympic tennis: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. 3. Medal structure: In each of these events, gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded. This means there are typically 15 medals awarded in tennis at each Olympics. 4. Athlete participation: Top tennis players from around the world usually participate in the Olympics, representing their countries. While some may opt out due to scheduling conflicts or other reasons, there are always enough high-level participants to ensure competitive events. 5. Cancellation risk: While there's always a small risk of event cancellation due to unforeseen circumstances (like what happened with some events in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics due to COVID-19), this risk is relatively low, especially for an established sport like tennis. 6. Time until resolution: The question resolves on August 4, 2024, which is during the Olympic Games. Tennis events are typically held throughout the Olympics, so medals will likely have been awarded by this date.

Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, so his first term is set to end in January 2025, well after the June 2024 deadline. 3. Potential for early departure: There are only a few ways a president can leave office before their term ends: a) Resignation: This is extremely rare and there's no indication Biden plans to resign. b) Impeachment and conviction: While always a possibility, there are currently no serious impeachment proceedings against Biden. c) Removal via the 25th Amendment: This would require his cabinet to declare him unfit, which seems unlikely. d) Death or severe incapacitation: While Biden is the oldest serving president, he appears to be in relatively good health for his age. 4. Political landscape: Despite some challenges and criticisms, there are no major political crises or scandals that threaten Biden's presidency at this time. 5. Historical precedent: It's very uncommon for US presidents to leave office mid-term. The last time this happened was with Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a date (June 30, 2024) that is well before the end of Biden's term and before the 2024 election. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that Joe Biden will still be president at the end of June 2024.

Historical underestimation: The prompt mentions that previous markets 'significantly underestimated Manifold's belief in AI progress.' This suggests that there's a tendency for people to be more optimistic about AI progress than expected. 4. Ongoing AI development: Major tech companies and research institutions are continuously working on advancing AI capabilities. It's reasonable to expect further improvements in AI systems by August 2024. 5. Subjective nature of 'weak AGI': The poll intentionally doesn't define weak AGI, allowing respondents to use their own understanding. This subjectivity could lead to a higher percentage of positive responses as people might have varying thresholds for what constitutes weak AGI. 6. Increased awareness and discussion: As AI capabilities continue to improve and become more visible in everyday life, more people might become convinced that weak AGI has been achieved. Given these factors, especially the current trend (27% in June) and the historical underestimation of Manifold's belief in AI progress, it seems quite likely that the 30% threshold will be reached or exceeded by August 2024. However, there's still some uncertainty, as unexpected setbacks in AI development or a shift in public perception could occur."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Manifold respondents vs. general public: The question asks if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public.

Marketing and buzz: As of now, there's limited information about the marketing campaign for \"Trap.\" However, Shyamalan's films typically generate significant buzz due to his reputation for twist endings. 4. Release date: The film is set to release on August 2, 2024. August can be a good month for thriller releases, as it's towards the end of the summer blockbuster season. 5. Competition: Without knowing the full release schedule for August 2024, it's hard to gauge the competition. However, late summer often sees a mix of lingering blockbusters and new releases. 6. Budget and studio support: The film is being produced by Warner Bros., which suggests it will have decent studio backing and marketing support. 7. Pandemic recovery: By 2024, the box office is expected to have largely recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic impacts, potentially leading to stronger opening weekends. 8. Inflation: With the release date in 2024, ticket prices are likely to be slightly higher than current prices, which could push the gross higher. Given Shyamalan's recent performance with \"Old\" just surpassing $15 million and \"Knock at the Cabin\" falling just short, combined with his name recognition and the likely studio support, there's a good chance \"Trap\" will exceed $15 million.

This is in contrast to team sports players. 2.

This provides multiple opportunities for athletes to compete and potentially win medals. 2. Historical precedent: In recent Olympic Games, it has been common for top players to win multiple medals.

The historical precedent is strong, and the structure of the tournament provides ample opportunities for top players to compete in multiple events. However, we must also consider potential challenges: - Upsets can happen, especially in a high-pressure environment like the Olympics. - The field in Olympic tennis is often strong, with many countries fielding their best players. - The physical demands of competing in multiple events within a short timeframe can be challenging.

Time frame: The question is asked very close to the start of the Olympics (created on July 28, 2024, with the Olympics typically starting in late July or early August). At this point, it's highly unlikely that tennis would be removed from the program or that all tennis events would be cancelled. 6. Unforeseen circumstances: While extremely unlikely, we must consider the small possibility of extraordinary events that could lead to no medals being awarded, such as a last-minute cancellation of all tennis events due to a global crisis or an unprecedented decision to change the medal structure.

This shows that Biden is capable of and willing to do long-form interviews. 2. Election year: 2024 is a presidential election year, and Biden is likely to be running for re-election. During election campaigns, candidates typically increase their media presence to reach voters. This could increase the likelihood of Biden participating in longer interviews. 3. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 82 by the end of 2024, and there have been ongoing discussions about his age and fitness for office. Longer interviews might be seen as a way to demonstrate his mental acuity and stamina, which could motivate his team to arrange such appearances. 4. Media landscape: With the rise of podcasts and streaming platforms, there are more opportunities for long-form interviews than ever before. Shows like Joe Rogan Experience, The Breakfast Club, or even traditional outlets like 60 Minutes (if they decide to air a longer segment) could provide venues for such interviews. 5.

This is a relatively short time frame, which could decrease the likelihood of such an interview occurring. 3. Election year: 2024 is a presidential election year, and July is just a few months before the general election in November.

However, they also offer a chance to connect with voters and explain policies in depth. Biden's campaign team may see value in such interviews as the election approaches. 5. Media landscape: There are numerous platforms (podcasts, late-night shows, news programs) that could potentially host such an interview. The availability of these opportunities increases the chances of it happening. 6. Biden's schedule: As the incumbent president and a candidate, Biden's schedule is likely to be very busy.

Recent Olympic trends: In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), Caeleb Dressel (USA) won 5 gold medals in swimming, tying for the most individual golds.

Swimming event structure: The Olympic swimming program typically includes a large number of events, providing more opportunities for medals compared to many other sports. 6. Team sports: It's worth noting that team sports athletes are at a disadvantage in this metric, as they typically can only win one gold medal per Olympics. 7. Uncertainty factors: Injuries, upsets, and emerging talents can always affect the outcomes in unpredictable ways. Given these factors, swimmers have a strong chance of winning the most gold medals.

Verification requirement: The commitment needs to satisfy at least one member of righttowarn.ai, which adds another layer of specificity. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of OpenAI making such a commitment. The short time frame and the specificity of the requirements work against a positive resolution. However, the growing pressure for AI transparency and OpenAI's position in the industry make it plausible that they might make such a commitment. The requirement for verification by righttowarn.ai adds uncertainty, as we don't know their specific criteria or how stringent they might be. Considering all these factors, I estimate there's a slightly less than even chance of this occurring within the given timeframe."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.022816012620947228, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.011408006310473614, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2146144575845227, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current agreement status: Verisign has been managing the .com domain registry since 1995, and their current agreement with the US Department of Commerce extends through November 30, 2024. This agreement has been in place for a long time and has been renewed multiple times. 2. Stability and security concerns: The .com domain is critical to the global internet infrastructure. Any change in its management would require careful consideration to ensure continued stability and security. Abrupt changes are unlikely due to these concerns. 3. Time frame: The question asks about termination before August 3, 2024, which is less than four months from now (as of the creation date of this question). Major changes to internet infrastructure typically require longer planning and transition periods. 4. Lack of public discussion or announcements: There have been no significant public discussions or announcements from the US government or relevant stakeholders about plans to end this agreement prematurely. Such a major change would likely be preceded by public debate and consultation. 5. Verisign's performance: There haven't been any major controversies or issues with Verisign's management of the .com domain that would prompt an early termination of the agreement. 6.

However, there are no clear indications of any pressing factors that would necessitate such a rapid change. 7.

Historical context: Verisign has been managing the .com domain since 2000, and their agreement with the US government has been renewed multiple times. The most recent renewal was in 2018, extending the agreement until November 30, 2024. 2. Current agreement status: The current agreement is set to expire on November 30, 2024, which is before the resolution date of August 3, 2025. This means there's a natural opportunity for change within the timeframe. 3. Stability and security concerns: The .com domain is critical to the global internet infrastructure.

Political and regulatory environment: Changes in US administration or shifts in internet governance policies could influence the decision to end or continue the agreement with Verisign. 5. Alternatives to Verisign: For the US government to end the agreement, there would need to be a viable alternative or a new management structure in place. Developing and implementing such alternatives takes time and careful planning. 6. Global internet governance trends: There's been a trend towards more international cooperation in internet governance, which could potentially influence the US government's decision. 7.

Current situation: As of now (April 2023), Russia does control parts of Ukraine, including Crimea and portions of eastern Ukraine. 2. Duration of the conflict: The war has been ongoing since February 2022, and by June 2024, it will have lasted for over two years. Prolonged conflicts often result in entrenched positions. 3. International support: Ukraine continues to receive significant military and financial support from Western countries, which helps them resist Russian advances and potentially regain territory. 4. Russian determination: Despite setbacks, Russia has shown a strong commitment to maintaining control over occupied territories and potentially expanding its presence in Ukraine. 5. Ukrainian resistance: Ukraine has demonstrated remarkable resilience and has successfully conducted counteroffensives, reclaiming some territories. 6. Diplomatic efforts: While peace negotiations have been unsuccessful so far, there's always a possibility of a diplomatic solution before June 2024. 7. Military capabilities: Both sides have experienced significant losses, but Russia's larger population and industrial base may allow it to sustain a longer conflict. 8. Geographical factors: Some occupied areas, like Crimea, are more easily defensible for Russia due to their location and existing infrastructure. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that Russia will still control at least some part of Ukraine by June 1, 2024.

Current geopolitical tensions: The relationship between Israel and Iran has been historically tense, with both countries viewing each other as significant threats. Recent events, such as Iran's support for Hamas and its nuclear program, have further escalated tensions. 2. Historical precedent: Israel has been known to conduct covert operations and targeted strikes against perceived threats, including within Iranian territory. These have included cyberattacks, assassinations of nuclear scientists, and sabotage of nuclear facilities. 3. Time frame: The question gives a relatively short window of about two weeks from the creation date to the resolution date. This limited timeframe reduces the probability of such an attack occurring. 4. Escalation risks: A direct, deadly attack by Israel within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation, potentially leading to a wider regional conflict. This risk might make Israel hesitant to carry out such an operation. 5. International pressure: The ongoing conflict in Gaza and international calls for de-escalation might discourage Israel from taking such a provocative action against Iran. 6. Intelligence and operational capabilities: Israel has demonstrated sophisticated intelligence and military capabilities in the past, making such an operation technically feasible. 7. Threshold for resolution: The question specifies that at least five individuals must die for it to resolve as Yes. This is a relatively low threshold for a military operation, increasing the likelihood of a Yes resolution if an attack does occur. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of such an attack occurring, but the short timeframe and potential consequences make it less likely than not.

Time frame: The question covers a short period of about 18 days from the creation date to the resolution date.

Historical precedent: Israel has conducted covert operations and targeted strikes against Iranian assets in the past, both within Iran and in other countries. However, direct attacks on Iranian soil attributed to Israel have been relatively rare. 4. Strategic considerations: An overt attack on Iranian soil would be a significant escalation and could potentially lead to a wider regional conflict. Israel typically prefers covert operations or cyber-attacks to avoid direct confrontation. 5. International pressure: The international community, including Israel's allies, may discourage such an overt attack due to the risk of escalation and potential destabilization of the region. 6. Iran's nuclear program: Concerns about Iran's nuclear capabilities have been a driving factor in Israel's strategic calculations. Any perceived advancement in this area could potentially trigger a response. 7. Recent events: The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, as well as tensions with Hezbollah, may divert Israel's immediate focus and resources away from direct confrontation with Iran. Given these factors, while there is always a possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran, the likelihood of it occurring within this specific and short timeframe is relatively low.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in US history. There are ongoing concerns about his age and mental acuity, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current statements and actions: As of now (July 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has already launched his 2024 campaign. This strongly indicates he plans to accept the nomination. 4. Party support: The Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden's re-election bid, with no significant challengers emerging within the party. 5. Political climate: While Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, they are not at a catastrophic level that would typically force an incumbent to step aside. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before August 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's highly unlikely for a sitting president to wait until the last minute to decline the nomination, as it would throw the party into chaos. 7.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he will not accept the nomination before August 15, 2024.

Competition level: While Duplantis is the clear favorite, there are other strong competitors like Sam Kendricks (USA), Renaud Lavillenie (France), and Christopher Nilsen (USA) who have personal bests over 6.00m. 5. Olympic pressure: The Olympics often bring out exceptional performances due to the high-stakes nature of the event. 6. Timing: The question is asked very close to the event (about a week before), which means we have up-to-date information on athletes' form. 7. Venue conditions: Paris in August typically has favorable weather conditions for pole vaulting. Given these factors, I believe there is a high probability that the Olympic record will be equaled or broken. Armand Duplantis is in excellent form and has consistently jumped higher than the current Olympic record. The presence of other strong competitors may push him to even greater heights. The only major factor that could prevent this would be unexpected poor weather conditions or an injury to the top contenders."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

This makes the probability lower than if it was just asking if it would be above 75,000. 6. Market sentiment: Investor sentiment and global events can significantly impact the market in unpredictable ways. 7.

Given these factors, while it's certainly possible for the SENSEX to reach this range by July 2024, the specificity of the range and the exact date make it a relatively low probability event.

They competed under the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) flag instead. 3.

Other countries, including the Baltic states and Poland, have also expressed strong opposition to Russian participation. 5.

Potential for exceptions: The question allows for up to 34 Russian athletes to compete without triggering a \"Yes\" resolution. This leaves room for some individual exceptions or specific sports to include Russian athletes. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Russian athletes will face significant restrictions at the 2024 Olympics. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the strong opposition from multiple countries make it difficult for the IOC to allow full Russian participation without facing severe backlash. However, the IOC's exploration of a pathway for neutral athletes and the allowance for up to 34 Russian athletes in the question's criteria suggest that a complete ban is not certain. It's possible that a small number of Russian athletes who meet strict neutrality criteria could be allowed to compete.

Precedent from previous Olympics: In the 2020/2021 Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Olympics, Russian athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) flag due to doping sanctions.

The IOC has shown a preference for allowing participation when possible, even if under modified conditions. However, there's still a significant chance that stricter conditions could be imposed due to ongoing geopolitical pressures. The situation remains fluid, and a major escalation in the Ukraine conflict or increased international pressure could lead to stricter measures. Considering all these factors, I estimate there's a moderate probability that the conditions specified in the question will be met."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09541140987375521, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047705704936877605, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44671751814760474, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Russian athletes will face significant restrictions. However, the IOC's exploration of a pathway for neutral athletes and the relatively low threshold for a \"No\" resolution (35 athletes) make it less certain that Russians will be completely barred or limited to fewer than 35 athletes. The IOC generally tries to be inclusive and may allow a limited number of Russian athletes to compete under a neutral flag. This could potentially exceed the 34-athlete limit set in the question, especially considering that 335 Russian athletes competed in the 2020 Olympics.

Given that Trump is already leading by 2.4 points on July 5, and considering the short timeframe to July 15, it seems more likely than not that he will maintain a lead of at least 2 points. However, the race could tighten slightly as we get closer to the election. The question specifically asks if Trump's lead will be greater than 2 points, not equal to or greater than 2 points. This adds a slight degree of uncertainty, as even a small tightening of the race could bring Trump's lead to exactly 2 points or just below.

Doping concerns: While doping scandals have occurred in the past, leading to stripped titles, the anti-doping measures have become more stringent over the years. Even in cases where a winner is later disqualified, there is typically a new official winner named. Given these factors, it is highly likely that the Tour de France 2024 will take place as scheduled and that an official winner will be declared. The only scenarios that would lead to a 'NO' resolution would be extremely unlikely events such as a last-minute cancellation of the entire tour or a situation where all participants are disqualified."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Vaccination and immunity: The levels of vaccination and natural immunity in the population for each virus can affect the timing and severity of peaks. 4.

Given these factors, it's quite possible that the COVID-19 peak could occur within four weeks of the combined peak: - The combined peak is likely to occur when all three viruses are circulating at high levels simultaneously, which often happens during the winter months. - COVID-19, being more unpredictable, could peak around the same time as this combined peak due to increased indoor gatherings and holiday travel. - The four-week window provides some flexibility, allowing for slight variations in timing. However, there are also reasons why the COVID-19 peak might not align closely with the combined peak: - COVID-19 has shown the ability to surge at various times of the year, not just during the traditional respiratory virus season. - Differences in transmission dynamics and incubation periods between the viruses could lead to separated peaks. - Public health measures or behavioral changes in response to one virus might affect the others differently.

Ongoing global tensions: Geopolitical conflicts and ideological extremism continue to pose threats to Western countries, including France. 3. France's role in international affairs: As a prominent Western nation with an active role in global politics and military interventions, France may be seen as a target by various extremist groups. 4. Upcoming events: The 2024 Summer Olympics will be held in Paris, which could potentially attract terrorist activities due to its high-profile nature and international attention. 5. Intelligence and security measures: French intelligence and security services have improved their capabilities in preventing and countering terrorist threats. However, the risk can never be completely eliminated. 6. Definition of 'terrorist attack': The question's criteria for a terrorist attack are quite broad, including any event described as such by French officials that results in at least one injury or death. 7. Time frame: The question covers an entire calendar year, which is a significant period during which various factors could change. Given these considerations, while French authorities will undoubtedly be on high alert and working to prevent any attacks, the combination of France's profile as a potential target, the broad definition of a terrorist attack in the question, and the extended time frame make it more likely than not that some form of terrorist act meeting the specified criteria will occur.

Historical context: Russian athletes have faced restrictions in recent Olympic Games due to doping scandals. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), Russian athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) flag, not the Russian national flag. 2. Current geopolitical situation: Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to increased international sanctions and isolation, including in the sports world. Many international sports federations have banned Russian athletes or teams from competing under the Russian flag. 3. IOC's stance: As of April 2023, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to compete as neutral athletes, without national symbols, flags, or anthems.

Precedent: The question states that for a 'Yes' resolution, no more than 34 Russians can compete under the Russian flag, which is 10% of the number that participated in the 2020 Olympics. This suggests an expectation of continued restrictions. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that Russian athletes will be barred from competing under the Russian flag at the 2024 Olympics. The ongoing war in Ukraine, the precedent set in recent Olympics, and the current IOC recommendations all point towards continued restrictions on Russian participation under their national flag. While there is a possibility of policy changes or geopolitical shifts before the 2024 Olympics, it would require a significant and rapid improvement in Russia's international relations to lift these restrictions entirely.

Recent history: There have been no recent diplomatic expulsions or recalls between these two countries, which suggests a certain level of diplomatic restraint despite tensions. 3. Time frame: The question asks about events occurring before June 1, 2024, which is less than a year away. This relatively short time frame reduces the likelihood of such a significant diplomatic action. 4. Potential triggers: Escalation of territorial disputes, incidents at sea, or major policy shifts could potentially lead to diplomatic expulsions or recalls. 5. Philippine leadership: The current Philippine administration under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has shown a tendency to balance relations with China and the United States, which might make them hesitant to take drastic diplomatic measures. 6.

Historical relations: The Philippines and China have had a complex relationship, particularly due to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. This has led to tensions in the past, but both countries have generally maintained diplomatic relations. 2. Current geopolitical climate: There are ongoing disputes over maritime territories, particularly the Spratly Islands and Scarborough Shoal. These disputes have occasionally escalated, leading to diplomatic tensions. 3. Recent incidents: In recent years, there have been several confrontations between Philippine and Chinese vessels in disputed waters. These incidents have increased tensions but have not yet led to diplomatic expulsions or recalls. 4. Time frame: The question gives a timeframe of about one year from now. This is a relatively short period, which reduces the likelihood of such a significant diplomatic action occurring. 5. Economic ties: Despite political tensions, both countries have strong economic ties, which may discourage them from taking drastic diplomatic measures. 6. International pressure: The international community, particularly ASEAN and the United States, often encourages peaceful resolution of disputes in the region, which might deter extreme diplomatic actions. 7. Domestic politics: Changes in leadership or shifts in domestic political sentiment in either country could potentially influence foreign policy decisions. Given these factors, while there is certainly potential for increased tensions, the likelihood of actual diplomatic expulsions or recalls seems relatively low.

The question asks about a value between 75,000 and 77,000 points, which would represent a significant increase over the current year. 2. Historical growth: The BSE SENSEX has shown strong growth over the past decades. However, growth rates can vary significantly year to year. 3. Time frame: The question is about the value approximately one year from now, which is a relatively short time for such a significant increase (about 15-18% growth). 4. Economic factors: India's economy has been growing rapidly, but there are also global economic uncertainties that could impact the stock market. 5. Market volatility: Stock markets can be unpredictable, especially when predicting specific values within a narrow range. 6. Specific date: The question asks about July 21, 2024, which is a Sunday. Stock markets are typically closed on Sundays, so the closing value would likely be from the previous Friday (July 19, 2024). Given these factors, while it's possible for the SENSEX to reach the 75,000-77,000 range by July 2024, it seems somewhat unlikely. The required growth rate is high for a one-year period, and predicting it to fall within such a specific range adds another layer of uncertainty. However, given India's strong economic growth prospects and the historical performance of the SENSEX, it's not entirely improbable.

Historical performance: The SENSEX has shown strong growth over the past years. In the last decade, there have been years with over 15% annual growth, so such an increase is not unprecedented. 3. Economic factors: India's economy is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. The country is benefiting from factors such as a young workforce, increasing foreign investments, and government initiatives to boost manufacturing and infrastructure. 4. Global economic conditions: The global economy faces uncertainties due to factors like inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. These could impact Indian markets both positively (as a relatively stable investment destination) or negatively (if global risk aversion increases). 5. Domestic factors: Upcoming general elections in India in 2024 could introduce some volatility in the markets. However, historically, Indian markets have shown resilience to political changes. 6. Time frame: The question asks about a specific date (July 21, 2024), which is about a year from now. This provides a reasonable timeframe for significant market movements. 7. Psychological barrier: 75,000 is a significant psychological level, which might act as a resistance point. However, if the market momentum is strong, it could also act as a magnet for traders and investors.
