Current geopolitical tensions: There are heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, especially following Israel's strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus on April 1, 2024, which killed several Iranian military officials. 2. Iran's threat of retaliation: Iran has vowed to retaliate against Israel for this attack, increasing the likelihood of an Iranian attack on Israeli soil. 3. Historical precedent: While Iran has supported proxy groups like Hezbollah and Hamas in attacks against Israel, direct attacks by Iran on Israeli soil have been rare. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about three weeks from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a relatively short time frame for Iran to plan and execute a significant attack within Israel's borders. 5. Israeli defense capabilities: Israel has a sophisticated defense system and intelligence network, which makes it challenging for Iran to carry out a large-scale attack on Israeli soil. 6. International pressure: There is likely to be significant international pressure on both sides to de-escalate the situation, which could deter Iran from carrying out a direct attack. 7. Definition of 'deadly attack': The question specifies that at least five individuals must die for it to be considered a deadly attack. This threshold makes it less likely for smaller-scale incidents to affect the resolution. 8. Attribution: The attack must be credibly attributed to Iran, which adds another layer of complexity to the resolution. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that Iran will not carry out a deadly attack within Israel before May 1, 2024. The short time frame, Israel's defensive capabilities, and potential international intervention all work in favor of this outcome.

Vaccination rates: The uptake of vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza could affect the timing and severity of their peaks. 4.

There's a reasonable chance that the peaks of these three viruses could occur within a few weeks of each other, especially during the winter months. However, the question asks if the maximum weekly rate for each virus individually will occur more than four weeks away from the combined peak of all three. Given the different typical peak times for these viruses, it's quite possible that at least one of them (likely RSV) could peak more than four weeks away from the combined peak. The combined peak would likely occur when at least two of the viruses are at high levels, which might not coincide with the individual peak of the third virus. Additionally, the extended observation period (October to June) increases the likelihood of seeing separated peaks for at least one of the viruses. However, there's still a significant chance that the peaks could align more closely due to factors like co-circulation and potential changes in seasonal patterns.

The rate of new traders joining might slow down as the market matures. 2. 78 new traders in 11 days requires a consistent influx of about 7 new traders per day, which is not insignificant. 3.

The next legislative elections are not scheduled until 2027, unless there's a dissolution of the National Assembly. 5.

Given these factors, it seems more likely that the current 'Together' coalition will still be in power in July 2024. While there's a possibility of a change due to political instability, it would require either a major shift in parliamentary support or a decision by President Macron to appoint a Prime Minister from the opposition, which is uncommon in French politics.

Variability in performance: Olympic results can be unpredictable, with unexpected victories or losses potentially shifting the medal balance. Given these factors, it's more likely that the USA will win more gold medals than silver medals, as they have done in most recent Olympics. The Tokyo 2020 result (more silver than gold) appears to be an anomaly rather than a new trend. However, the possibility of a repeat or a close margin cannot be entirely ruled out.

Manifold is a prediction market platform, which likely attracts a more politically engaged and potentially different demographic than the general public. 2.

Potential factors influencing the difference: - Biden's incumbency and name recognition might actually work against him among Manifold respondents, who are likely more informed about his presidency. - A generic Democrat might be viewed more favorably as respondents can project their ideal candidate onto this placeholder. - However, the \"generic\" nature might also work against the Democrat, as some respondents might prefer a known entity (Biden) over an unknown. 6. Manifold user base characteristics: Manifold users are likely to be more politically engaged and possibly more contrarian than the general public.

General polling trends: Public opinion polls have shown Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, while other hypothetical Democratic candidates perform better against Trump. 2. Manifold respondents vs. general public: The question asks if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. We don't have specific information about the demographics or political leanings of Manifold users, so we should be cautious about assuming they perfectly mirror the general population. 3. The specific polls in question: We need to compare the results of two polls on Manifold - one with Joe Biden and one with a generic Democrat. 4. The 3% threshold: Trump needs to gain less than 3% in the Biden poll compared to the generic Democrat poll for this to resolve as YES. Given these factors, here's my analysis: a) If Manifold respondents somewhat reflect general polling trends, we would expect Trump to perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat. b) However, the 3% threshold is relatively small. Even if Trump does perform better against Biden, it may not be by such a large margin among Manifold users. c) Manifold users might be more politically engaged or informed than the general public, which could lead to less variation in their voting preferences between Biden and a generic Democrat. d) The short time frame (polls closing on July 6) and the fact that this question was created just two days before the polls close suggests that there might not be enough time for a significant shift in opinions between the two polls. e) The formula for calculating Trump's percentage ((Trump / (Trump + Democrat + Someone else))) means that even a small shift in the 'Someone else' category could impact the results. Considering all these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Trump will gain less than 3% when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. The engaged nature of Manifold users, the short time frame, and the relatively high 3% threshold all contribute to this assessment."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04126088187275112, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.02063044093637556, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28988551782622446, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical data: Geomagnetic storms with a Kp index greater than 5 are relatively rare. Most geomagnetic activity falls within the range of 0-4 on the Kp index. 2. Solar cycle: Geomagnetic storms are closely tied to solar activity. We are currently in Solar Cycle 25, which began in December 2019. By July 2024, we will be approaching the peak of this cycle, which typically occurs 3-5 years after the cycle's start. 3. Time frame: The question covers a 12-day period, which is a relatively short time in terms of space weather. However, it's long enough that there's a reasonable chance of seeing some geomagnetic activity. 4. Season: July is not typically associated with higher geomagnetic activity. The most active periods tend to be around the equinoxes (March and September). 5. Unpredictability: Space weather can be highly unpredictable, and strong storms can occur with little warning. Given these factors, it's more likely that the strongest geomagnetic storm during this period will have a Kp index less than or equal to 4. However, there's also a significant chance of a storm with Kp > 5, especially considering we'll be near the solar cycle peak. The question resolves YES if the Kp index is either \u2264 4 or > 5.

Franchise popularity: - Both Deadpool and Wolverine are highly popular characters in the Marvel universe. - Combining these characters in one film is likely to generate significant buzz and anticipation. 3. Box office trends: - Superhero movies, especially those in the Marvel universe, tend to perform very well at the box office. - Recent trends show that big-budget superhero films often have massive opening weekends. 4.

However, their failure to qualify in 2023 and the increasing competitiveness of the contest suggest that the risk of non-qualification is significant. Given the information available at this time, I would estimate that there's a moderate chance that Poland will fail to qualify for the Grand Final."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current standing: As of the 2019 European Parliament elections, GUE/NGL (European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left) holds 39 out of 705 seats, which is far from being the largest group. The largest groups are currently EPP (European People's Party) with 176 seats and S&D (Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats) with 145 seats. 2. Historical performance: GUE/NGL has never been the largest group in the European Parliament. It has consistently been one of the smaller groups. 3. Political trends: There's no significant indication of a massive shift towards far-left politics across Europe that would suggest GUE/NGL could become the largest group. 4. Recent national elections: While there have been some gains for left-wing parties in certain countries, these haven't been substantial enough to suggest a continent-wide shift that would propel GUE/NGL to the top position. 5. Brexit impact: The UK's departure from the EU has already been factored into the current seat distribution, so it's unlikely to cause significant changes in the 2024 elections. 6. Fragmentation of the left: The left-wing vote in Europe is often split between multiple parties and groups, which makes it harder for a single left-wing group like GUE/NGL to dominate. 7. Rise of other political movements: In recent years, there has been more growth in support for green parties, right-wing populist parties, and centrist liberal parties rather than far-left parties. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that GUE/NGL will hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections. While political landscapes can change, the gap between GUE/NGL's current position and the top spot is so large that it would require an unprecedented and currently unforeseen political shift across multiple European countries."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "dff0a050-1a38-4473-9f1e-bd852d6c60ca", "title": "Will GUE/NGL not hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if GUE/NGL does not hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliament elections and as **No** if GUE/NGL holds the most seats.
