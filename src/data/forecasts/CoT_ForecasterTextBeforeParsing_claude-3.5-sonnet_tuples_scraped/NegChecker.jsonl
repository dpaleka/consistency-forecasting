Current geopolitical tensions: There are heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, especially following Israel's strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus on April 1, 2024, which killed several Iranian military officials. 2. Iran's threat of retaliation: Iran has vowed to retaliate against Israel for this attack, increasing the likelihood of an Iranian attack on Israeli soil. 3. Historical precedent: While Iran has supported proxy groups like Hezbollah and Hamas in attacks against Israel, direct attacks by Iran on Israeli soil have been rare. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about three weeks from the creation date to the resolution date. This is a relatively short time frame for Iran to plan and execute a significant attack within Israel's borders. 5. Israeli defense capabilities: Israel has a sophisticated defense system and intelligence network, which makes it challenging for Iran to carry out a large-scale attack on Israeli soil. 6. International pressure: There is likely to be significant international pressure on both sides to de-escalate the situation, which could deter Iran from carrying out a direct attack. 7. Definition of 'deadly attack': The question specifies that at least five individuals must die for it to be considered a deadly attack. This threshold makes it less likely for smaller-scale incidents to affect the resolution. 8. Attribution: The attack must be credibly attributed to Iran, which adds another layer of complexity to the resolution. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that Iran will not carry out a deadly attack within Israel before May 1, 2024. The short time frame, Israel's defensive capabilities, and potential international intervention all work in favor of this outcome.

Vaccination rates: The uptake of vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza could affect the timing and severity of their peaks. 4.

There's a reasonable chance that the peaks of these three viruses could occur within a few weeks of each other, especially during the winter months. However, the question asks if the maximum weekly rate for each virus individually will occur more than four weeks away from the combined peak of all three. Given the different typical peak times for these viruses, it's quite possible that at least one of them (likely RSV) could peak more than four weeks away from the combined peak. The combined peak would likely occur when at least two of the viruses are at high levels, which might not coincide with the individual peak of the third virus. Additionally, the extended observation period (October to June) increases the likelihood of seeing separated peaks for at least one of the viruses. However, there's still a significant chance that the peaks could align more closely due to factors like co-circulation and potential changes in seasonal patterns.

The rate of new traders joining might slow down as the market matures. 2. 78 new traders in 11 days requires a consistent influx of about 7 new traders per day, which is not insignificant. 3.

The next legislative elections are not scheduled until 2027, unless there's a dissolution of the National Assembly. 5.

Given these factors, it seems more likely that the current 'Together' coalition will still be in power in July 2024. While there's a possibility of a change due to political instability, it would require either a major shift in parliamentary support or a decision by President Macron to appoint a Prime Minister from the opposition, which is uncommon in French politics.

Variability in performance: Olympic results can be unpredictable, with unexpected victories or losses potentially shifting the medal balance. Given these factors, it's more likely that the USA will win more gold medals than silver medals, as they have done in most recent Olympics. The Tokyo 2020 result (more silver than gold) appears to be an anomaly rather than a new trend. However, the possibility of a repeat or a close margin cannot be entirely ruled out.

Manifold is a prediction market platform, which likely attracts a more politically engaged and potentially different demographic than the general public. 2.

Potential factors influencing the difference: - Biden's incumbency and name recognition might actually work against him among Manifold respondents, who are likely more informed about his presidency. - A generic Democrat might be viewed more favorably as respondents can project their ideal candidate onto this placeholder. - However, the \"generic\" nature might also work against the Democrat, as some respondents might prefer a known entity (Biden) over an unknown. 6. Manifold user base characteristics: Manifold users are likely to be more politically engaged and possibly more contrarian than the general public.

General polling trends: Public opinion polls have shown Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, while other hypothetical Democratic candidates perform better against Trump. 2. Manifold respondents vs. general public: The question asks if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. We don't have specific information about the demographics or political leanings of Manifold users, so we should be cautious about assuming they perfectly mirror the general population. 3. The specific polls in question: We need to compare the results of two polls on Manifold - one with Joe Biden and one with a generic Democrat. 4. The 3% threshold: Trump needs to gain less than 3% in the Biden poll compared to the generic Democrat poll for this to resolve as YES. Given these factors, here's my analysis: a) If Manifold respondents somewhat reflect general polling trends, we would expect Trump to perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat. b) However, the 3% threshold is relatively small. Even if Trump does perform better against Biden, it may not be by such a large margin among Manifold users. c) Manifold users might be more politically engaged or informed than the general public, which could lead to less variation in their voting preferences between Biden and a generic Democrat. d) The short time frame (polls closing on July 6) and the fact that this question was created just two days before the polls close suggests that there might not be enough time for a significant shift in opinions between the two polls. e) The formula for calculating Trump's percentage ((Trump / (Trump + Democrat + Someone else))) means that even a small shift in the 'Someone else' category could impact the results. Considering all these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Trump will gain less than 3% when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. The engaged nature of Manifold users, the short time frame, and the relatively high 3% threshold all contribute to this assessment."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.04126088187275112, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.02063044093637556, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28988551782622446, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical data: Geomagnetic storms with a Kp index greater than 5 are relatively rare. Most geomagnetic activity falls within the range of 0-4 on the Kp index. 2. Solar cycle: Geomagnetic storms are closely tied to solar activity. We are currently in Solar Cycle 25, which began in December 2019. By July 2024, we will be approaching the peak of this cycle, which typically occurs 3-5 years after the cycle's start. 3. Time frame: The question covers a 12-day period, which is a relatively short time in terms of space weather. However, it's long enough that there's a reasonable chance of seeing some geomagnetic activity. 4. Season: July is not typically associated with higher geomagnetic activity. The most active periods tend to be around the equinoxes (March and September). 5. Unpredictability: Space weather can be highly unpredictable, and strong storms can occur with little warning. Given these factors, it's more likely that the strongest geomagnetic storm during this period will have a Kp index less than or equal to 4. However, there's also a significant chance of a storm with Kp > 5, especially considering we'll be near the solar cycle peak. The question resolves YES if the Kp index is either \u2264 4 or > 5.

Franchise popularity: - Both Deadpool and Wolverine are highly popular characters in the Marvel universe. - Combining these characters in one film is likely to generate significant buzz and anticipation. 3. Box office trends: - Superhero movies, especially those in the Marvel universe, tend to perform very well at the box office. - Recent trends show that big-budget superhero films often have massive opening weekends. 4.

However, their failure to qualify in 2023 and the increasing competitiveness of the contest suggest that the risk of non-qualification is significant. Given the information available at this time, I would estimate that there's a moderate chance that Poland will fail to qualify for the Grand Final."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Fragmentation of the left: The left-wing vote in Europe is often split between multiple parties and groups, which makes it harder for a single left-wing group like GUE/NGL to dominate. 7. Rise of other political movements: In recent years, there has been more growth in support for green parties, right-wing populist parties, and centrist liberal parties rather than far-left parties. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that GUE/NGL will hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections.

Alternatives: Democrats might prefer to work behind the scenes to influence Biden's decision rather than making a public statement. 7.

Precedent: It's unusual for a party to pressure a sitting president not to run for re-election, especially this close to the election. Given these factors, while there is clearly some dissatisfaction within the Democratic Party, the likelihood of at least 5 named members taking such a bold and potentially divisive step in the next two weeks seems relatively low.

Time frame: The resolution date is July 23, 2024, but the question specifically asks about actions before July 20th. This gives approximately two weeks from the creation date for additional members to join the call for Biden to drop out. 3. Political climate: The fact that there are multiple drafts of letters circulating among House Democrats suggests there is some momentum building for this action. However, openly calling for the incumbent president of your own party to drop out is a significant and risky political move. 4. Criteria: The question requires a coordinated effort of 5 or more named Democratic House Members or Senators. Individual statements to reporters don't count, which makes reaching the threshold more difficult. 5. Biden's current standing: While there are concerns about Biden's age and electability, he remains the presumptive Democratic nominee. Many Democrats may be hesitant to openly oppose him, fearing party disunity. 6. Ambiguity clause: The question states that in ambiguous cases, the market will err towards resolving YES. This slightly increases the likelihood of a YES resolution. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that fewer than 5 named Democratic House Members or Senators will pressure Biden to drop out before July 20th. While there is clearly some discontent within the party, the high bar for coordination, the short time frame, and the political risks involved make it less likely that we'll see 5 or more named individuals take this step.

They have the power to disqualify candidates based on various criteria, including perceived threat to the Islamic Republic's principles. 5.

For it to resolve as 'NO' (greater than 4), Trump's lead would need to increase by more than 1.6 points in just 10 days. Considering the current lead is closer to 3 than to 4, and given the typically slow movement of polling averages over short periods, it seems more likely that the lead will remain closer to 3 than increase beyond 4.

Recent appointment: Linda Yaccarino was appointed as Twitter's CEO in May 2023, which means she will have been in the role for just over a year by July 2024. This is a relatively short tenure, and new CEOs often need time to implement their strategies and prove their worth. 2. Twitter's volatility: Twitter has experienced significant changes and challenges since Elon Musk's acquisition in 2022. The platform has undergone numerous policy changes, staff reductions, and strategic shifts. This volatile environment could make it more challenging for a new CEO to establish long-term stability. 3. Elon Musk's influence: As the owner of Twitter, Elon Musk has shown a tendency to make sudden decisions and changes. His continued involvement could potentially impact Yaccarino's position, either positively or negatively. 4. Yaccarino's background: She comes from a strong media background, having previously worked at NBCUniversal. Her experience in advertising and media could be valuable for Twitter's revenue growth, which might increase her chances of remaining in the role. 5. Twitter's performance: The company's financial performance and user growth under Yaccarino's leadership will be crucial factors in determining her longevity as CEO. If she can demonstrate positive results within her first year, it would strengthen her position. 6. Tech industry trends: The tech industry, particularly social media platforms, can be unpredictable. Unforeseen challenges or opportunities could arise that might affect Twitter's leadership structure. 7. Average CEO tenure: According to various studies, the average tenure for tech CEOs is around 6-8 years. While this varies widely, it suggests that a CEO leaving after just one year would be relatively unusual. Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderately high chance that Linda Yaccarino will still be Twitter's CEO on July 1, 2024. The main risks to her position are the platform's volatility and Elon Musk's unpredictable influence. However, her relevant experience and the typically longer tenures of tech CEOs work in her favor. Additionally, one year is often considered too short to fully evaluate a CEO's performance, which may give her more time to prove herself."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "ac1e3ebe-d08a-4df6-aed1-22d36f2d1cee", "title": "Will Linda Yaccarino not be the CEO of Twitter on July 1, 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Linda Yaccarino is not in the position of CEO at Twitter on July 1, 2024, according to official announcements from Twitter or credible media sources.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T11:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-05-27T02:28:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.35, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of Linda Yaccarino not being the CEO of Twitter on July 1, 2024, we need to consider several factors: 1.

The specific criteria set in the question: The question resolves as 'Yes' if no more than 34 Russian athletes compete, which is a relatively low threshold. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that Russian athletes will be barred from competing or severely restricted in their participation. The IOC's exploration of a neutral athlete pathway suggests they are trying to find a compromise, but the strong opposition from other countries and the ongoing conflict make it difficult to imagine a large Russian contingent at the Games. The low threshold of 34 athletes for a 'Yes' resolution also increases the likelihood of this outcome. Even if some Russian athletes are allowed to compete as neutral individuals, it's probable that the number will be kept low to appease opposing countries and maintain the integrity of the Games.

This already increases the likelihood of a positive resolution, as these nations represent a significant portion of the competitive Warhammer 40,000 scene. 3.

This creates a potential demand for a new nighttime spectacle. 2. D23 Expo significance: D23 is Disney's official fan club, and its expo is often used for major announcements about Disney parks and experiences. This makes it a likely venue for such an announcement if one is planned. 3. Disney's current focus: In recent years, Disney has been investing heavily in new attractions and land expansions (like Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and the upcoming Tron Lightcycle Run). They might be looking to balance this with a new entertainment offering like a parade. 4. Financial considerations: Nighttime parades are expensive to produce and maintain.

D23 Expo timing: D23 is Disney's official fan club, and their expo is a major event where significant announcements are often made.

Post-pandemic recovery: As the theme park industry continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Disney might be looking for new attractions to draw visitors back.

Recent trends: The question mentions that recent appearances (Stephanopoulos, Jimmy Fallon, 60 Minutes) have been shorter than 30 minutes of actual interview time. This suggests a preference for shorter formats. 8.

This increases the chances of different countries winning in different sports. 4. Number of sports: With eight different sports, there are many opportunities for different countries to win gold. However, it only takes one country winning two golds for the question to resolve as \"Yes\". 5. Competitive balance: Women's team sports have become increasingly competitive globally, with more nations developing strong programs. This could lead to a more even distribution of gold medals. 6. Short time frame for resolution: The question resolves relatively quickly after the start of the Olympics, which means we won't have to wait long to know the outcome. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that at least one nation will win more than one women's team sport gold medal. The historical precedent, the existence of countries with strong programs across multiple sports, and the fact that only two wins are needed for a \"Yes\" resolution all point in this direction.

Complexity of the agreement: The Pandemic Agreement aims to address global health security, which is a complex and multifaceted issue. Reaching consensus on all aspects of such an agreement among numerous countries with diverse interests can be challenging. 3.

Biden, while the oldest serving president, has maintained an active schedule and has not shown signs of significant physical or mental incapacity. 2. Political climate: The invocation of the 25th Amendment Section 4 is an extremely rare and serious action.

The likelihood of such a significant event occurring in this short timeframe is very low. 5. Historical precedent: The 25th Amendment Section 4 has never been invoked in U.S. history.

The Democratic party, which controls the executive branch, has shown no indication of considering such a move. 3.

Recent incidents: There have been several confrontations between Philippine and Chinese vessels in disputed waters, including water cannon incidents and alleged ramming of boats. 3. Philippine foreign policy: Under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the Philippines has been more assertive in defending its territorial claims and has strengthened its alliance with the United States. 4.

Considering these factors, it seems likely that at least 24 world records will be broken. The historical trend shows that recent Olympics have consistently seen more than 24 world records broken. While there's a slight downward trend in the number of records broken per Olympics, the additional year of preparation due to the Tokyo Olympics delay and the introduction of new sports could counteract this. The continued advancement in sports science, technology, and training methods, combined with the ever-increasing pool of elite athletes, suggests that we will continue to see impressive performances pushing the boundaries of human capability.

Time until the event: The question is being asked about a year in advance. This gives the university ample time to plan and prepare for the ceremonies, reducing the likelihood of last-minute changes or cancellations. 3. Potential disruptions: We need to consider possible reasons why the ceremonies might not be held as scheduled: a) Natural disasters: While California is prone to earthquakes and wildfires, the likelihood of a major event specifically affecting UCLA on June 14, 2024, is relatively low. b) Public health concerns: The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions to many events in recent years. However, as of 2023, most institutions have returned to normal operations, and it's unlikely that a similar situation would arise in 2024. c) Venue issues: The Pauley Pavilion is a well-maintained facility, and major renovations or structural issues are unlikely to occur without advance notice. d) Administrative decisions: There's always a small chance that the university administration might decide to change the format or timing of the ceremonies, but this is uncommon for such a significant event. 4. Flexibility in resolution criteria: The question allows for a one-hour buffer in start times, which provides some leeway for minor delays. 5. Multiple ceremonies: For the question to resolve as Yes, all three ceremonies would need to be affected, which is less likely than just one ceremony being disrupted. Given these factors, it seems highly probable that UCLA will hold its graduation ceremonies as scheduled. The university has strong incentives to maintain this important tradition, and there are no apparent reasons to expect significant disruptions.

The recent attack on Iran's consulate in Damascus, attributed to Israel, has further escalated tensions. 2. Historical precedent: Israel has conducted covert operations in Iran before, but large-scale, deadly attacks within Iranian borders have been rare. Most Israeli actions against Iran have been focused on sabotage, assassinations of key figures, or cyber attacks. 3. Time frame: The question covers a relatively short period (about 2.5 weeks from the creation date to the resolution date). This limited timeframe reduces the likelihood of a major escalation occurring. 4. International pressure: The international community, including Israel's allies, would likely discourage any overt military action against Iran to prevent further destabilization in the region. 5. Iran's retaliatory capabilities: Israel is aware that a direct, deadly attack on Iranian soil could provoke a significant retaliation from Iran, potentially leading to a wider conflict. This serves as a deterrent for such actions. 6. Focus on other threats: Israel is currently engaged in conflicts on multiple fronts, particularly in Gaza. This may limit its willingness and capacity to open a new front with Iran. 7. Definition of \"deadly attack\": The question specifies that at least five individuals must die for it to be considered a deadly attack. This threshold makes it less likely for smaller-scale operations to qualify.

This suggests a rapid increase in perception of AI progress. 2. Time frame: The question is about the July 2024 poll, which is only one month after the June poll.

World record: The current world record is 6.22m, set by Armand Duplantis of Sweden in 2023. This shows that heights above 6.04m are achievable. 3. Recent performances: Armand Duplantis has been dominating the pole vault scene in recent years. He has consistently cleared heights above 6.04m in major competitions. 4. Olympic pressure: The Olympics often bring out exceptional performances due to the high stakes and global attention. This could potentially lead to record-breaking attempts. 5. Time until the event: The question is created about 3 weeks before the Olympics. This proximity means we have a good idea of current form and any recent injuries of top athletes. 6. Historical context: Olympic records in pole vault are not broken frequently. Before Braz's 2016 record, the previous Olympic record (6.02m) stood for 24 years. Given these factors, I believe there's a significant chance the record will be broken, primarily due to Armand Duplantis's exceptional recent form and his ability to clear heights well above 6.04m consistently. However, Olympic competitions can be unpredictable, and factors like weather conditions, pressure, or unexpected performances from other athletes could prevent a new record.

This suggests that Russian athletes, who are likely to make up a significant portion of INAs, have the potential to win a substantial number of gold medals. 2. Participation restrictions: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has allowed Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as INAs due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, there may be restrictions on the number of athletes allowed to participate or in which sports they can compete, which could limit their medal-winning potential. 3. Preparation and funding: INAs may face challenges in terms of training, funding, and support compared to athletes representing their countries, which could impact their performance. 4. Psychological factors: Competing without national representation might affect some athletes' motivation or performance, while others might be more determined to prove themselves. 5. Competition from other countries: The overall level of competition at the Olympics is very high, and other nations may have improved their performance since the last Games. 6. Time frame: The market resolution date is set for August 11, 2024, which is likely near the end of the Olympics. This gives INAs the full duration of the Games to accumulate medals. 7. Uncertainty: The exact number and composition of INAs participating in the Paris 2024 Olympics is not yet known, adding uncertainty to the prediction. Given these factors, it seems that INAs have the potential to win 15 or more gold medals, based on the previous performance of Russian athletes. However, the restrictions and challenges they face as INAs could significantly impact their performance.

Historical context: In recent years, the US has experienced higher than usual inflation rates. However, there has been a general trend of inflation cooling down in 2023 and early 2024. 2. Federal Reserve policy: The Fed has been implementing tight monetary policy to combat inflation. This typically leads to a gradual slowdown in price increases. 3. Recent trends: Month-over-month Core CPI increases have been moderating. In the months leading up to July 2024, we might expect to see increases closer to 0.2% or 0.3%, based on the cooling trend. 4. Seasonality: July typically doesn't have strong seasonal effects on Core CPI, so we wouldn't expect significant deviations due to seasonal factors. 5. Economic conditions: By July 2024, the impact of previous interest rate hikes and other economic measures should be more fully realized, potentially leading to further moderation in price increases. 6. Time frame: The question is about a specific month (July 2024) compared to the previous month. Month-to-month variations can be volatile, and a 0.1% or lower increase is certainly possible, though still on the lower end of typical monthly changes. 7. Core CPI exclusions: Core CPI excludes food and energy prices, which are often the most volatile. This makes a very low increase more plausible than for overall CPI. 8. Threshold: The question asks about 0.1% or less, which gives some room for a small increase or even a flat month. Given these factors, while it's possible to see a Core CPI increase of 0.1% or less in July 2024, it's not highly probable. The cooling trend in inflation makes it more likely than it would have been in 2022 or 2023, but 0.1% is still a very low month-over-month increase for Core CPI.

His recent movies have had varying degrees of success: - 'Old' (2021): $16.8 million opening - 'Glass' (2019): $40.3 million opening - 'Split' (2016): $40 million opening. 2. Genre and appeal: 'Trap' is described as a psychological thriller, which is Shyamalan's forte. This genre typically has a dedicated audience but may not always reach blockbuster levels. 3.

Given these factors, it seems that 'Trap' has a decent chance of crossing the $20 million mark in its opening weekend, but it's not a certainty. Shyamalan's name recognition and the thriller genre work in its favor, but the performance of his recent films suggests it could go either way.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' (2024) grossing \u2264$20 million during its domestic opening weekend, we need to consider several factors: 1. Director's track record: M. Night Shyamalan has a mixed box office history. While he's had some major successes, his recent films have had varying performances: - 'Old' (2021): $16.8 million opening - 'Glass' (2019): $40.3 million opening - 'Split' (2016): $40 million opening - 'The Visit' (2015): $25.4 million opening 2. Genre and appeal: 'Trap' is described as a psychological thriller, which is typically Shyamalan's forte. These types of films often have a dedicated audience but may not always break into blockbuster territory. 3. Marketing and buzz: As of now, there's limited information about the marketing campaign for 'Trap.' The level of promotion closer to release will significantly impact opening weekend numbers. 4. Release date and competition: The film is set to release on August 2, 2024. The summer movie season can be competitive, but August is often seen as a slower month, which could work in the film's favor. 5. Budget: While the exact budget isn't known, Shyamalan's recent films have had relatively modest budgets, which could mean the studio isn't expecting massive opening numbers. 6. Pandemic recovery: By 2024, the movie industry should be further along in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially leading to higher theater attendance. 7. Streaming competition: The continued growth of streaming services could impact theatrical releases, though less so for event films or those with strong director appeal. Given these factors, it seems that 'Trap' could go either way in terms of crossing the $20 million threshold. Shyamalan's name still carries weight, and his last few films have performed reasonably well. However, 'Old' did open below $20 million, showing that it's certainly possible for his films to fall in this range. Considering the mixed factors and the trend of his recent films, I believe there's a slightly higher chance that 'Trap' will gross over $20 million in its opening weekend, but it's a close call."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Nature of the accusation: Charging journalists or opposition politicians in connection with an assassination attempt is a serious matter that would likely face intense scrutiny both domestically and internationally. Such charges would need substantial evidence to be credible. 4. Press freedom concerns: Slovakia has faced criticism in the past regarding press freedom, particularly after the murder of journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak in 2018. Charging a journalist in connection with an assassination attempt could lead to significant backlash and international pressure. 5. Political implications: Charging an opposition politician would be seen as a highly political move, potentially destabilizing the country's political landscape and drawing international criticism. 6. Lack of precedent: There's no mention of any evidence or suspicion pointing towards journalists or opposition politicians being involved in the assassination attempt, which makes it less likely that charges would be brought against them. 7. Legal process: Even if there were suspicions, the legal process to bring formal charges typically takes time, especially for such a high-profile case. The short timeframe makes it less likely that charges would be filed before the resolution date. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that either a journalist or an opposition politician would be charged in connection with the assassination attempt on Robert Fico before June 15, 2024. The short timeframe, the serious nature of such charges, and the potential domestic and international repercussions all point towards a low probability of this occurring."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.012333651126851919, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0061668255634259594, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15570941865504534, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given these factors, Lithuania's chances of qualification seem fairly balanced. Their recent improvement in results suggests they're taking the contest seriously and sending competitive entries. However, the competition in Eurovision is always fierce, and qualification is never guaranteed. Considering their mixed recent history (qualifying in 2021 and 2022, but not in 2023) and the general unpredictability of Eurovision, I would estimate that Lithuania has a slightly better than even chance of qualifying. Therefore, the probability of them failing to qualify (the question resolving as YES) is slightly less than 50%."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Past performance: In the 2022/23 season, Haaland scored an incredible 36 goals in the Premier League, breaking the record for most goals in a 38-game season. This demonstrates his exceptional goal-scoring ability and adaptability to the Premier League. 2. Consistency: Haaland has shown remarkable consistency in his goal-scoring across different leagues and competitions. His track record suggests that his performance last season was not a fluke. 3. Team support: Manchester City, Haaland's team, is known for creating numerous goal-scoring opportunities. The team's playing style and quality of midfielders greatly benefit a striker like Haaland. 4. Injury history: While Haaland has had some injury concerns in the past, he managed to stay relatively healthy throughout the 2022/23 season, playing in 35 out of 38 league games. 5. Competition: Other prolific goal-scorers in the league include Harry Kane (who has since left for Bayern Munich), Mohamed Salah, and Son Heung-min. However, none of them came close to Haaland's tally last season. 6. Age and potential: At 23 years old, Haaland is still young and potentially improving, which could lead to even better performances. 7. Adaptation period: Having already spent a season in the Premier League, Haaland is now fully accustomed to the league's style and pace, which could lead to improved performances. 8. Manager's trust: Pep Guardiola, Manchester City's manager, has shown great faith in Haaland, which likely translates to consistent playing time and opportunities. However, we must also consider potential risks: 1. Increased focus from defenders: Teams may develop more effective strategies to contain Haaland this season. 2. Potential injuries: While he was mostly healthy last season, injuries could always impact his goal tally. 3. Rotation: Manchester City's squad depth might lead to some rotation, potentially reducing Haaland's playing time in some matches. Given these factors, especially Haaland's exceptional performance last season, his consistency, the strong support from his team, and the departure of one of his main competitors (Harry Kane), I believe there is a very high probability that Haaland will again be the top scorer in the 2023/24 Premier League season."}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "131f217b-3b67-4a55-8472-3d1554101a94", "title": "Will Erling Haaland not score the most goals in the 2023/24 Premier League season?", "body": "The question resolves **Yes** if Erling Haaland is not the player with the largest number of goals after each of the 20 PL teams plays their 38th game of the 2023/24 season, [according to Oracle Cloud via the PL website](https://www.premierleague.com/stats/top/players/goals?se=578)", "resolution_date": "2024-05-20T01:30:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-09-26T22:20:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.25, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To answer this question, we need to consider several factors: 1.

Consistency: Haaland has shown remarkable consistency in his goal-scoring, not just in the Premier League but throughout his career. 3. Manchester City's playing style: The team is built to create numerous chances for their striker, which benefits Haaland greatly. 4. Potential injuries or suspensions: These could affect Haaland's ability to maintain his goal-scoring rate, but he has been relatively injury-free in recent times. 5. Competition: While there are other excellent strikers in the Premier League (like Harry Kane before his transfer, Mohamed Salah, Son Heung-min), none have shown the same level of consistent goal-scoring as Haaland in recent seasons. 6.

They last qualified in 2016 and have failed to make it through the semi-finals in the last six contests they participated in (2017-2023, excluding 2020 which was cancelled). 2. Competition format: Eurovision typically has two semi-finals, with around 18 countries in each. Only 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the Grand Final.

Potential for improvement: The Latvian broadcaster might be motivated to improve their selection process or invest more in their entry given their recent string of non-qualifications.

Competition level: The overall quality of entries from other countries can affect Latvia's chances, but this is also unknown at this point. 7. Voting patterns: While not always consistent, there are sometimes voting blocs or regional preferences that can influence results. Latvia doesn't benefit strongly from any particular voting bloc.

Legal precedent: There have been attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates, but it has rarely been successful in modern times. The most notable recent case was the disqualification of Couy Griffin in New Mexico for his involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot. 2. Trump's involvement in the January 6th events: Trump's actions surrounding the January 6th Capitol riot have been a subject of intense scrutiny and could potentially be grounds for disqualification under the 14th Amendment. 3. State-level actions: Some states have already begun exploring the possibility of removing Trump from the ballot. For example, in September 2023, a lawsuit was filed in Colorado seeking to bar Trump from the ballot under the 14th Amendment. 4. Political climate: The issue is highly politicized, and decisions may vary significantly from state to state based on political leanings. 5. Legal challenges: Any attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would likely face immediate and vigorous legal challenges, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. 6.

This reduces the window of opportunity for such an action to occur and be in effect by the resolution date. 7.

Given these factors, I believe there is a non-trivial chance that at least one state might attempt to remove or block Trump from their primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. However, the likelihood of this action surviving legal challenges and remaining in effect by July 15, 2024, is considerably lower. The most likely scenario for this to occur would be in a state with a strong Democratic lean and a willingness to take bold legal action.

Legal precedent: There is no clear precedent for removing a presidential candidate from a ballot using Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This lack of precedent makes it less likely for states to take such a bold step. 2. Political implications: Removing a major party candidate from the ballot would be an extremely controversial move, likely to face significant political backlash. States may be hesitant to take such action due to the potential political consequences. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the general election. Most primary elections will have already taken place by this time, reducing the likelihood of last-minute ballot removals. 4. Ongoing legal challenges: Trump is currently facing various legal challenges, including federal indictments. However, these are separate from the 14th Amendment issue and may not directly lead to ballot removal. 5. State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret the 14th Amendment differently, and some may be more inclined to attempt removal than others. However, for the question to resolve as 'No,' only one state would need to successfully remove Trump from the ballot. 6. Potential Supreme Court involvement: If any state attempts to remove Trump from the ballot, it's likely that the case would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court. The court may be reluctant to allow such a significant intervention in the electoral process without clear legal grounds. 7. Trump's legal team: Trump has a history of aggressively fighting legal challenges. His team would likely mount strong opposition to any attempt to remove him from ballots, potentially delaying or preventing such actions. 8. Public opinion: While Trump is a controversial figure, a significant portion of the Republican base supports him. This could make it politically difficult for states, especially those with Republican-controlled governments, to remove him from the ballot.

Historical context: ISS has previously recommended against Elon Musk's compensation package and Kimbal Musk's re-election. In 2018, ISS advised shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's $2.6 billion compensation package, citing concerns about its size and structure. In 2022, ISS recommended voting against Kimbal Musk's re-election to the board, citing concerns about his independence. 2. Recent developments: Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package was recently voided by a Delaware judge, who ruled that the board process leading to the approval was deeply flawed. This legal decision might influence ISS's stance on any new compensation package proposed for Musk. 3. Corporate governance concerns: ISS typically focuses on good corporate governance practices. Tesla has faced criticism for its board composition, including the presence of Kimbal Musk (Elon's brother) as a board member, which raises questions about board independence. 4. Size of the compensation package: The $57 billion package mentioned in the question is extremely large, even by CEO standards. ISS tends to scrutinize such outsized compensation plans carefully. 5. Tesla's performance: While Tesla has performed well in recent years, any downturn or missed targets could influence ISS's recommendation. 6. Time frame: The question resolves by June 12, 2024, which gives ample time for ISS to review and make a recommendation before Tesla's 2024 shareholder meeting. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that ISS will recommend against either Elon Musk's compensation package or Kimbal Musk's re-election, or both. The recent court decision voiding the previous package, combined with ISS's historical stance and general approach to corporate governance issues, strongly suggests they will take a critical view.

Recent developments: Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package was recently voided by a Delaware judge in January 2024, which may influence ISS's stance on any new package proposed. 3. Corporate governance concerns: ISS typically focuses on good corporate governance practices. The close relationship between Elon and Kimbal Musk, as brothers, has been a point of concern for independent board representation. 4. Tesla's performance: The company's stock performance and overall business results could influence ISS's recommendations. Tesla has faced some challenges recently, including increased competition in the EV market. 5. Public scrutiny: There's been increased attention on executive compensation and board independence in recent years, which might pressure ISS to maintain a critical stance. 6. Time frame: The question resolves by June 12, 2024, which is likely close to Tesla's annual shareholder meeting, when such recommendations are typically made. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that ISS will advise against either Elon Musk's pay package or Kimbal Musk's re-election, or both. ISS has a history of taking such positions, and recent events (like the voided pay package) may reinforce their stance. However, there's always a possibility that changes in Tesla's governance or performance could lead to a shift in ISS's recommendations.

ICC processes: The ICC typically conducts thorough investigations before issuing arrest warrants. These investigations can be lengthy, often taking months or even years. 3. Current situation: As of now, there are no public indications that the ICC is close to issuing arrest warrants for these specific Israeli leaders. While there have been calls for investigations into actions in Gaza, the process of moving from investigation to arrest warrants is complex and time-consuming. 4. Political considerations: Issuing arrest warrants for sitting leaders of a country, especially one with significant international support like Israel, is a highly sensitive matter. The ICC would likely proceed with extreme caution. 5. Precedent: The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state before (e.g., Sudan's Omar al-Bashir), but these cases are rare and often take years to develop. 6. Ongoing conflict: The current situation in Gaza might actually slow down the ICC's processes, as gathering evidence and conducting investigations in an active conflict zone is challenging. 7.

This short timeframe might make it challenging for the council to fully review and discuss the ordinance, potentially leading to a continuation of the vote. 2. Complexity of the issue: Zoning changes, especially those related to housing density like the Missing Middle ordinance, are often complex and controversial. This complexity might lead to extended debates and a need for more time to consider all aspects. 3.

Domestic policies: Government policies, reforms, and budget announcements can affect market sentiment and performance. 6. Time frame: The question is about a specific date (July 21, 2024), which is about a year from now. This provides sufficient time for significant market movements. 7. Market volatility: Stock markets can be unpredictable, especially when looking at a specific date rather than a broader time frame. Given these factors, I believe there's a good chance the BSE SENSEX could reach or exceed 77,000 by July 21, 2024. The Indian economy's growth prospects and the market's historical performance support this view. However, the specific nature of the date and potential global economic uncertainties introduce some doubt. Considering all these factors, I estimate there's about a 60% chance that the BSE SENSEX will be greater than 77,000 on July 21, 2024. Conversely, this implies a 40% chance it will be less than or equal to 76,000."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.08353693220682645, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.041768466103413227, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4118331129111585, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

The quality of entries from other countries will play a significant role in Czechia's chances. 4. Selection process: As of now, we don't know Czechia's song or artist for 2024. The quality of their entry will be crucial in determining their chances of qualification. 5. Semi-final draw: The distribution of countries in each semi-final can affect qualification chances. Some semi-finals may be more competitive than others. 6. Voting patterns: Czechia doesn't have strong voting blocs or diaspora voting, which can be disadvantageous in Eurovision. 7. Staging and performance: These factors are unknown at this point but can significantly impact qualification chances. Given these factors, it's difficult to say with certainty whether Czechia will fail to qualify. Their recent 50% qualification rate suggests it could go either way. The failure to qualify in 2023 might indicate a downward trend, but it's not definitive. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher chance of Czechia failing to qualify than succeeding, mainly due to their recent non-qualification and lack of strong voting allies."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Fundraising: DeSantis has demonstrated strong fundraising capabilities, which is crucial for a successful presidential campaign. His ability to raise substantial funds suggests he has significant backing from donors and supporters. 4. Political experience: As the current Governor of Florida, DeSantis has executive experience and a track record of implementing conservative policies, which appeals to many Republican voters. 5. Trump factor: The biggest obstacle for DeSantis is likely to be Donald Trump, who still maintains a strong base of support within the party. However, Trump's legal issues and controversies may potentially weaken his position over time. 6.

The question implies that at least one diss track has been released, prompting this forecast. 2. Time frame: The resolution period is relatively short, lasting only about 22 days (from May 9 to June 1, 2024). This limited timeframe reduces the likelihood of additional tracks being released. 3. Artist behavior and history: Both Drake and Kendrick Lamar are known for their lyrical prowess and have engaged in rap beefs before. However, they are also established artists who might not want to engage in prolonged public feuds that could potentially damage their careers or reputations. 4. Production time: Creating, recording, and releasing a high-quality diss track takes time. Given the short timeframe, it might be challenging for either artist to produce and release another track so quickly, especially if they want it to be impactful. 5. Public and industry reaction: The reaction to the initial diss track(s) could influence whether either artist feels compelled to respond further. If the public or industry sentiment suggests that continuing the feud would be unwise, they might refrain from releasing more tracks. 6. Personal and professional commitments: Both artists likely have busy schedules with other projects, performances, or commitments that could prevent them from focusing on creating another diss track in this short period. 7. Potential for reconciliation: There's always a possibility that the artists could decide to end the feud quickly, either through private communication or public statements, which would make additional diss tracks unlikely. Considering these factors, I believe it's more likely that neither artist will release another diss track in the given timeframe. The short duration, potential drawbacks of prolonging the feud, and the time required to produce quality tracks all lean towards a resolution of YES.

Historical performance: Portugal has participated in Eurovision 53 times since 1964. They have qualified for the Grand Final 11 times out of 15 attempts since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004. This gives them a qualification rate of about 73%, which is relatively strong. 2.

Since then, they've qualified for the Grand Final in 2018, 2021, and 2022, missing out only in 2019 and 2023. This shows they've been fairly consistent in recent years. 3. Quality of entries: Portugal tends to send entries that are often praised for their musical quality and authenticity, even if they don't always appeal to the mass Eurovision audience. This approach can be hit-or-miss but generally gives them a decent chance of qualifying. 4. Voting patterns: Portugal benefits from diaspora voting, particularly from French-speaking countries and other Southern European nations. This can provide a boost in the semi-finals. 5.

Potential internal selection issues or changes: There's no information suggesting any significant changes to Portugal's selection process or participation status for 2024. Given Portugal's solid qualification record in recent years, their ability to occasionally produce standout entries, and the benefit of some reliable voting allies, they have a good chance of qualifying for the Grand Final in 2024.

Competition: The level of competition in Eurovision can vary from year to year, and the strength of other entries in Portugal's semi-final will affect their chances of qualification. 5.

Staging and performance: The live performance and staging can greatly influence voting, but this information is not available at the time of prediction. Given these factors, Portugal's chances of qualification are fairly balanced. Their recent performances show they are capable of qualifying, with two successful qualifications in the last three years. However, their failure to qualify in 2023 indicates vulnerability. Without knowing the specifics of their 2024 entry or the competition they'll face, it's difficult to lean strongly in either direction. Their historical qualification rate of 46% suggests a slight edge towards failing to qualify, but recent performances have been better than their long-term average.
