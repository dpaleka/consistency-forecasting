Recent events: The question was created on April 10, 2024, which means we need to consider any significant events or escalations that may have occurred just prior to this date. 3. Iran's capabilities: Iran has demonstrated its ability to conduct or support attacks against Israeli targets in the past, either directly or through proxy groups. 4. Israel's defense capabilities: Israel has a sophisticated defense system and intelligence network, which may deter or prevent potential attacks. 5. Time frame: The question covers a period of approximately three weeks, which is a relatively short time for planning and executing a major attack. 6. Threshold for resolution: The attack must result in at least five deaths within Israel's borders to qualify for a 'Yes' resolution. 7. International pressure and potential consequences: Iran may face severe repercussions from the international community if it carries out such an attack, which could serve as a deterrent. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant risk of an attack occurring, but several elements reduce the likelihood: - The short time frame limits the opportunity for Iran to plan and execute a major attack. - Israel's defense capabilities may prevent or mitigate potential attacks. - The requirement for at least five deaths sets a relatively high bar for the attack's impact. - International pressure and potential consequences may discourage Iran from taking such drastic action. However, the ongoing tensions and historical animosity between the two countries, combined with Iran's capabilities and potential motivations, suggest that the risk is not negligible.

Current geopolitical tensions: The relationship between Iran and Israel has been historically hostile, with ongoing tensions and proxy conflicts in the region. 2. Recent events: The Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus on April 1, 2024, which killed several Iranian military officials, has significantly escalated tensions between the two countries. 3. Iran's vow for retaliation: Following the Damascus attack, Iranian leaders have publicly vowed to retaliate against Israel, increasing the likelihood of an attack. 4. Time frame: The question provides a relatively short time frame (about 3 weeks from the creation date to the resolution date), which may limit Iran's ability to plan and execute a sophisticated attack. 5. Historical precedent: While Iran has supported proxy groups that have attacked Israel, direct attacks by Iran on Israeli soil have been rare. 6. Israel's defense capabilities: Israel has a sophisticated defense system and intelligence network, which may make it challenging for Iran to carry out a successful attack resulting in at least five deaths. 7. International pressure: The international community, including major powers, would likely try to prevent such an escalation, potentially deterring Iran from a direct attack. 8. Iran's strategic considerations: A direct attack on Israel could lead to severe consequences for Iran, including potential military retaliation and increased international sanctions. Considering these factors, there is a significant possibility of an Iranian-linked attack on Israel within the given timeframe, given the heightened tensions and Iran's vow for retaliation. However, the specific requirements of the attack (within Israel's borders and resulting in at least five deaths) make it less likely to occur. The short time frame, Israel's defense capabilities, and the potential consequences for Iran if they were to carry out such an attack all work to reduce the probability.

Lack of prior announcement: Given Musk's high profile, his attendance at such an event would typically be announced well in advance to generate buzz and increase ticket sales. The lack of such an announcement so close to the event date suggests he is unlikely to attend. 4. Musk's schedule and priorities: As the CEO of multiple companies (Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter), Musk has a very busy schedule. Attending a Bitcoin conference may not be a top priority for him, especially if it conflicts with other commitments. 5. Musk's recent focus: In recent times, Musk has been more focused on AI, Twitter (now X), and SpaceX projects rather than cryptocurrencies. 6. Short notice: For a high-profile figure like Musk to appear at an event with just a few days' notice would be unusual and logistically challenging. 7. Past attendance at crypto events: While Musk has spoken at some crypto-related events in the past, he is not a regular fixture at Bitcoin conferences. Given these factors, especially the lack of prior announcement and the very short time frame before the event, it seems highly unlikely that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 event as a speaker.

Given these factors, while ECR might gain some seats in the 2024 elections, it seems highly unlikely that they would gain enough to become the largest group in the European Parliament.

Current political landscape: As of July 2023, the Prime Minister of France is Elisabeth Borne, who belongs to the Renaissance party, which is part of the 'Together' (Ensemble) coalition. This coalition currently holds power. 2. Time until resolution: The question resolves on July 30, 2024, which is about a year from now. This is a significant amount of time in politics, during which many changes can occur. 3. French political system: In France, the President appoints the Prime Minister. The current President, Emmanuel Macron, cannot run for re-election in 2027 due to term limits. This might influence political maneuvering in the lead-up to the next election. 4. Recent political events: France has seen significant social unrest and protests in recent years, which could potentially lead to political shifts. 5. Stability of current coalition: While the 'Together' coalition currently holds power, coalitions can be fragile, especially in times of social or economic stress. 6. Alternatives: The question specifically mentions the New Popular Front as another coalition that would result in a 'No' answer. This suggests that there are other political forces that could potentially come to power. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that the Prime Minister on July 30, 2024, could belong to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together.

Current stock price: As of the question creation date (July 25, 2024), we don't have the exact stock price. However, Nvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks in recent years, largely due to its dominance in AI chips and graphics processors. It's likely that the stock price is significantly higher than $100 at the time of the question. 2. Time frame: The resolution date is July 31, 2024, which is only 6 days from the creation date. This is a very short time frame for a stock to experience a dramatic drop, especially for a company like Nvidia. 3. Market conditions: Without specific information about market conditions in July 2024, we have to assume relatively stable conditions. Major market crashes or company-specific disasters could cause rapid price drops, but these are rare events. 4. Company performance: Nvidia has been a leader in the AI and graphics chip industry. Unless there's been a major negative event or announcement, it's unlikely that the company's fundamentals would justify such a significant price drop in a short period. 5. Historical volatility: While tech stocks can be volatile, a drop below $100 would likely represent a massive percentage decrease from Nvidia's probable price range. Such a drop would be highly unusual without catastrophic news. 6. Market mechanics: The question specifies that NVDA needs to close below $100 on any day prior to July 31st. This allows for intraday volatility or temporary dips to trigger a YES resolution, which slightly increases the probability compared to needing to be below $100 on July 31st specifically. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that Nvidia would close below $100 in the given time frame. The stock would need to experience an unprecedented and rapid decline, which is unlikely without a major negative event that we have no indication of at this time."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

New series consideration: Kagurabachi is a relatively new series, having started in 2023. New series often try to maintain a consistent publication schedule to build and retain readership. 3.

Historical context: Verisign has been managing the .com domain since 2000, and their agreement with the US government has been renewed multiple times.

This agreement was last renewed in 2018 for a six-year term. 2.

Time frame: The question asks about discontinuation before August 3, 2024, which is less than four months from now (as of the question creation date) and about four months before the current contract is set to expire. 4. Complexity of transition: Changing the manager of such a crucial internet infrastructure component would be a complex process that would likely require significant planning and preparation time. 5. Lack of public discussion or announcements: There have been no recent public announcements or discussions about plans to change the .com domain management, which would be expected for such a significant change. 6. Stability and security considerations: The .com domain is critical to global internet infrastructure, and any changes would need to ensure continued stability and security. Abrupt changes could pose risks. 7.

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of this occurring. The existing dissent and behind-the-scenes activity suggest that there's real momentum building. However, the short time frame and the potential risks to party unity act as counterbalances.

The field of potential Republican candidates is still developing, with several high-profile figures like Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, and even Donald Trump Sr. being discussed as potential nominees. 2.

Margin of error: Polls typically have a margin of error, which could cause small fluctuations in the average. 6. Trend direction: If there's a slight upward trend for Trump, it's possible his lead could increase to the 3-4 point range. 7. Specificity of the question: The range is very narrow (just 1 percentage point), making it less likely to hit exactly. Given these factors, it seems possible but not highly probable that Trump's advantage will fall exactly in the 3-4 point range on July 15. The current 2.4 point lead is close, and a small shift in Trump's favor could push it into this range. However, the specificity of the range makes it less likely. If we assume a gradual trend in Trump's favor and some normal polling fluctuation, there's a reasonable chance his lead could increase to just over 3 points. However, the upper limit of 4 points provides a narrow target. Considering all these factors, I would estimate a moderate but not high probability of this outcome."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.012003969168639106, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.006001984584319553, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.15504341823651052, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, without specific recent data, we can assume she's maintaining a competitive level based on her past achievements. 3. Age: Hassan will be 31 years old during the 2024 Olympics. While this is not young for a distance runner, many athletes have succeeded at this age and beyond in endurance events. 4. Competition: The level of competition in women's distance running is always high, with strong contenders from East African countries and other nations. However, Hassan has proven she can compete with the best. 5. Versatility: Her ability to compete in multiple events (1500m, 5000m, 10,000m) increases her chances of medaling in at least one event. 6. Injury risk: There's always a risk of injury or illness that could affect her performance, but this applies to all athletes. 7. Preparation: Given her past success and the importance of the Olympics, it's likely she'll be well-prepared for the event. 8. Pressure and experience: Having already succeeded at the Olympic level, Hassan should be well-equipped to handle the pressure of the games. Given her exceptional past performance, versatility, and experience, Sifan Hassan has a strong chance of winning a medal. However, the unpredictable nature of sports, potential for injury, and strong competition prevent this from being a certainty."}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "dc022677-df22-4f06-a745-53d84ba0bd2b", "title": "Will Sifan Hassan secure a podium finish at the 2024 Paris Olympics?", "body": "The outcome is YES if Sifan Hassan earns any medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and NO if she does not.", "resolution_date": "2024-08-05T20:21:45Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-21T03:32:50Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.75, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of Sifan Hassan securing a podium finish at the 2024 Paris Olympics, we need to consider several factors: 1.

However, it's not a word that would typically come up in political discourse unless there's a specific context. 3. JD Vance's role: As a U.S. Senator, Vance's public communications are likely to focus on political issues, legislation, and constituent concerns.

Lack of context: There's no indication of any ongoing events or discussions that would make the word 'couch' more likely to come up in Vance's communications. 6.

Given these factors, the probability of JD Vance saying 'Couch' in this specific timeframe seems quite low.

This means that approximately 50% of the countries in each semi-final qualify. 3. Recent performance: San Marino's recent performances have been mixed. They failed to qualify in 2021 and 2022, and did not participate in 2023. This indicates a downward trend in their Eurovision success. 4. Country size and resources: San Marino is one of the smallest countries in Eurovision, which can limit its resources for producing competitive entries. This can affect the quality of their performance and chances of qualification. 5. Voting patterns: San Marino often struggles to secure enough votes from other countries due to its small size and limited diaspora, which can impact its chances of qualification. 6. Uncertainty of participation: As of the question's creation date (April 12, 2024), San Marino's participation in Eurovision 2024 is not explicitly confirmed. This adds an element of uncertainty to the prediction. 7. Time until the event: With the resolution date set for May 9, 2024, there is still time for San Marino to prepare a strong entry if they decide to participate. Given these factors, San Marino's chances of making it to the Grand Final appear to be relatively low. Their historical performance and recent trends suggest that qualification is not likely, but not impossible. The approximately 50% qualification rate from semi-finals provides some chance, but San Marino's specific challenges make it less likely for them to be in the top half."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Current polling trends: As of July 5, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points according to the 538 national polling average. This is within the range specified in the question (between 2 and 4 points). 2. Time frame: We're looking at the polling average on July 15, 2024, which is only 10 days from the last known data point. In such a short time, dramatic shifts in polling are less likely unless there's a major event. 3. Historical volatility: Presidential polls tend to fluctuate, but usually within a relatively narrow range, especially as the election approaches. 4. Potential events: The period between July 5 and July 15 could include important campaign events, debates, or news that could influence polls. However, without specific information about such events, we can't assume large shifts. 5. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points, which means small changes in the average are not necessarily significant. 6. Trend direction: The question doesn't provide information about the trend direction leading up to July 5. If we knew whether Trump's lead was increasing or decreasing, it would help predict the July 15 number more accurately. 7. Polling aggregation methods: 538's methodology for aggregating polls can smooth out short-term fluctuations, making large swings less likely in a 10-day period. Given that Trump's lead is already within the specified range (2.4 points on July 5), and considering the relatively short time frame, it seems reasonably likely that the lead will remain within this range. However, there's also a significant chance it could move slightly above or below this range. The question asks for a probability that Trump's lead will be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 points. Given the current lead of 2.4 points, there's more room for the lead to grow within the specified range than to shrink while staying in the range.

Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents often face challenges in their re-election bids, especially if economic conditions are unfavorable or if there are significant national issues. 3. Time until the election: The poll in question is for July 15, 2024, which is very close to the election (typically held in early November). By this time, both campaigns will be in full swing, and public opinion will be more solidified. 4. Potential events: Between now and July 2024, many events could impact the race, including debates, economic changes, international events, and potential scandals. 5. 538's methodology: 538 is known for its rigorous polling aggregation and tends to be more conservative in showing large leads for candidates. 6. Polarization: The US electorate is highly polarized, which tends to keep races close. 7. Specific range: The question asks about a very specific range (more than 2 but not exceeding 4 points), which is a relatively narrow window. Given these factors, I believe it's possible but not highly likely that Trump will have a lead in this specific range. Here's why: - The race is likely to be close, given current trends and polarization. - A lead of more than 2 points is significant this close to an election, but not unreasonable. - However, the upper limit of 4 points makes this a narrow range to hit. - 538's aggregation method might smooth out some of the more extreme poll results, making it less likely to show a large lead for either candidate. While it's certainly possible that Trump could have a lead in this range, I think it's more likely that either the race will be closer than a 2-point lead, or that if Trump does have a significant lead, it might exceed 4 points."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.17665628553515522, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.08832814276757761, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6201736729460423, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Polling data: Current polls show Hutchinson with very low support among Republican voters, often registering at 1% or less in national surveys. 7. Time until convention: While there is still time for dynamics to change before the Republican National Convention, Hutchinson would need to make significant gains in popularity and support to become a serious contender. 8. Historical precedent: It is rare for a candidate with such low initial recognition and support to secure a major party nomination, especially in a field with well-established frontrunners. Given these factors, the probability of Asa Hutchinson securing the Republican nomination appears to be very low. While not impossible, it would require a series of highly unlikely events and a dramatic shift in the political landscape for him to emerge as the nominee."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Historical context: The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) measures expected volatility in the S&P 500 index over the next 3 months. It tends to spike during periods of economic uncertainty or market stress. Current economic situation: As of July 2023, the global economy is still recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with ongoing concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential recession risks. Comparison point: We need to consider the VXVCLS value on July 20, 2023, as the benchmark. Without the exact number, we can assume it reflects the current economic uncertainties. Potential scenarios for July 2024: a) Economic recovery: If the global economy stabilizes and grows steadily, market volatility could decrease, leading to a lower VXVCLS. b) Continued uncertainty: If economic challenges persist or new ones emerge, volatility could remain elevated or increase. c) Unforeseen events: Geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or other unexpected events could cause sudden spikes in volatility. Time frame: The question is about a date approximately one year in the future, which is a relatively long time in terms of market dynamics. This increases uncertainty in the prediction. Mean reversion: Volatility indices tend to mean-revert over time, suggesting that extremely high or low values are likely to move towards their long-term average.

Publication schedule: Chainsaw Man is serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump magazine, which typically releases new chapters weekly. 2. Author's history: Tatsuki Fujimoto, the creator of Chainsaw Man, has taken breaks between parts of the series before.

Current storyline: Without knowing the exact content of chapter 173, it's hard to predict if a narrative break point is approaching that might warrant a hiatus. 4.

Manga series sometimes take breaks during holiday periods or at the end of story arcs, but August isn't typically associated with major holidays in Japan. 5. Length of serialization: By chapter 173, the series will have been running for a considerable time. Long-running series sometimes take breaks to allow the author to rest or plan future arcs. 6. No prior announcement: The question doesn't mention any pre-announced hiatus, which would typically be communicated in advance if planned. 7. Frequency of hiatuses: While breaks do occur in manga publication, they are not extremely common between consecutive chapters unless pre-announced or due to unforeseen circumstances. Given these factors, a hiatus between chapters 173 and 174 is possible but not highly likely.

Uruguay's squad depth: If Uruguay has a deep squad with quality players on the bench, rotation becomes more feasible without significantly weakening the team. 4. Tactical considerations: The US and Panama likely present different tactical challenges, which might necessitate some changes to the starting lineup. 5. Player form and fitness: If any players underperformed against Panama or picked up minor injuries, they might be rotated out. 6. Tournament strategy: Depending on Uruguay's group stage schedule and their long-term tournament strategy, they might choose to rotate players to keep the squad fresh for later matches. 7. Coach's preferences: Some coaches are more prone to rotation than others. Without knowing the specific tendencies of Uruguay's coach, this is a bit of an unknown factor. Given these considerations, I believe there's a moderate to high chance of significant rotation. The step up in competition from Panama to the US, combined with the importance of the Copa America, suggests that Uruguay will want to field a strong team. However, the need to manage player workload in a tournament setting, along with potential tactical adjustments, makes some rotation likely.

Current political climate: As of now, there are no major scheduled events or anticipated developments that would likely cause a significant shift in Harris's favor within a week. 5. Incumbent advantage: If Joe Biden is the incumbent in this scenario, Harris (as his VP) might benefit from the incumbent advantage, which could provide some upward pressure on her odds. 6. Margin for increase: The probability only needs to increase slightly (by 0.1 percentage points) to resolve as YES, which makes it somewhat more likely. 7. Polling volatility: Even without major events, polls can fluctuate slightly due to normal statistical variation, which could nudge the probability either way. 8. Media coverage: Any positive media coverage for Harris or negative coverage for her opponents could provide a small boost. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of a small increase in Harris's odds, but it's far from certain.

However, we must also consider: 1. Swift's busy schedule: She is currently on her highly successful Eras Tour, which might limit her availability for film projects. 2. Lack of official confirmation: As of now, there's no official announcement or confirmation of Swift's involvement in the film. 3. Potential for rumors to be unfounded: Fan speculation and rumors don't always translate to reality in film production. Given these factors, while there's a reasonable possibility of Swift making a cameo, it's far from certain. The connection to Reynolds, Marvel's history of surprise cameos, and the broad criteria for what counts as a cameo increase the likelihood.

It's highly unusual for a sitting VP to choose a running mate, as they are typically part of the incumbent ticket. 2. Timing: The question states that Kamala will choose before August 7th, 2024. This is very close to the Democratic National Convention, which is typically when the presidential nominee announces their VP pick. However, Biden would be the one making this decision, not Harris. 3. Candidates mentioned: a) Mark Kelly: A sitting U.S. Senator from Arizona, former astronaut, and husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. He has a strong profile but is already in a crucial Senate seat. b) Josh Shapiro: The current Governor of Pennsylvania, a key swing state. He has a rising profile in the Democratic Party. 4. Likelihood of change: The probability of Biden choosing a different running mate than his current VP is extremely low, as it would signal a lack of confidence in the administration and potentially harm their re-election chances. 5. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to change running mates. The last time this happened was in 1976 when Gerald Ford replaced Nelson Rockefeller with Bob Dole. Given these factors, the scenario presented in the question is highly improbable. It assumes that Kamala Harris would be choosing her own running mate, which is not how the process works for an incumbent ticket. The question appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the political process or contains erroneous assumptions. The probability of this scenario occurring as described is extremely low.

Candidates mentioned: Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro are both prominent Democrats, but they're not typically considered top-tier VP candidates in current political discussions. Mark Kelly is a Senator from Arizona and a former astronaut. He has a compelling personal story and represents a swing state, which could be advantageous. Josh Shapiro is the Governor of Pennsylvania, another crucial swing state. He's known for his strong stance on democratic values and election integrity. 4. Other potential candidates: There are many other potential VP candidates who are not mentioned here, including more prominent national figures or those who might balance the ticket in different ways. 5.

His most recent film, 'Knock at the Cabin' (2023), opened at $14.1 million, while 'Old' (2021) opened at $16.8 million. 2. Genre appeal: 'Trap' is described as a psychological thriller, a genre that can be hit-or-miss at the box office.

Current form: While Ronaldo's form can fluctuate, he has maintained a high level of performance for Portugal in recent years. His goal-scoring ability remains strong, even as he ages. 3. Portugal's chances in the tournament: The longer Portugal stays in the tournament, the more opportunities Ronaldo will have to score. Portugal is typically a strong contender in international competitions. 4. Ronaldo's role in the team: As the captain and main striker, Ronaldo is likely to play a significant number of minutes and be the focal point of Portugal's attack. 5. Motivation: Euro 2024 could potentially be one of Ronaldo's last major international tournaments, which may provide extra motivation for him to perform well. 6. Competition schedule: The group stage alone typically involves three matches, giving Ronaldo multiple opportunities to score even if Portugal doesn't progress far in the tournament. 7. Set-piece opportunities: Ronaldo is Portugal's primary penalty taker and a threat on free kicks, increasing his chances of scoring. 8. Historical Euro performance: Ronaldo has scored in every European Championship he has played in since 2004, holding the record for most goals in the competition's history. However, there are some factors that could reduce his chances: 1. Age: Ronaldo will be 39 during Euro 2024, which could impact his performance. 2.

The level of competition is expected to be high, which reduces the probability of any single team winning. 4.

This proximity to the event means that current form and preparation are crucial factors, but we lack specific information about the German team's recent performances or training. 5. Nature of the game: Warhammer 40,000 involves both strategic skill and an element of chance due to dice rolls. This inherent randomness makes it more difficult for even a strong favorite to secure victory consistently. 6. Field size: Without knowing the exact number of teams participating, it's hard to precisely calculate the odds. However, assuming there are at least 16-32 teams (a common range for international championships), the probability of any single team winning is naturally reduced. Given these factors, we can conclude that while Germany likely has a competitive team, the nature of the competition and the game itself makes it difficult for any single nation to have a high probability of winning.

Season 2 trend: The ratings for Season 2 have been more volatile and generally lower than Season 1, with a significant drop in the last two episodes (7.6 and 6.1). 3.

Incumbent advantage: Kamala Harris is the current Vice President, and it's common practice for incumbent presidents to keep their running mates when seeking re-election. This tradition provides stability and continuity. 2. Biden's commitment: President Joe Biden has repeatedly expressed his intention to run for re-election and has publicly stated his satisfaction with Harris as his VP. He has given no indication of wanting to change his running mate. 3. Democratic Party unity: Changing the VP nominee could be seen as a sign of internal discord within the party, which Democrats would likely want to avoid in a potentially close election. 4. Harris's qualifications: Despite some criticism, Harris has valuable experience as VP, Senator, and Attorney General of California. Her background as a woman of color also adds diversity to the ticket, which is important for the Democratic base. 5. Timing: The market's creation date (July 16, 2024) and resolution date (August 10, 2024) suggest this is very close to the Democratic National Convention, where the nomination would be officially confirmed. At this late stage, a change in VP would be highly unusual and disruptive. 6. No strong alternatives: There hasn't been any significant public discussion or rumors about potential replacements for Harris, which would likely occur if a change was being seriously considered. 7. Political cost of change: Replacing Harris could alienate some voters, particularly among women and people of color, who are crucial demographics for the Democratic Party.

Democratic Party unity: Replacing Harris could be seen as divisive and potentially alienate certain demographics within the Democratic base, particularly women and people of color. 4.

The most notable recent case was against Marjorie Taylor Greene, which failed. 2. State-by-State Approach: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently. Some states might be more inclined to attempt removal than others. 3. Time Frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is close to the general election but after most primaries. This gives ample time for legal challenges and appeals. 4. Trump's Legal Situation: Trump is facing multiple criminal charges, which could potentially be used to argue for his disqualification under the 14th Amendment. 5. Political Climate: The attempt to remove Trump from the ballot would be highly controversial and likely face significant political and legal pushback. 6. Constitutional Interpretation: There's debate among legal scholars about whether the 14th Amendment applies to the presidency and how it should be enforced. 7. Potential Supreme Court Involvement: Given the high stakes, any attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would likely end up at the Supreme Court, which could rule on the constitutionality of such actions. 8. Historical Precedent: No major presidential candidate has ever been removed from a ballot under the 14th Amendment, setting a high bar for such an action. While there are factors that could lead to attempts to remove Trump from ballots, the legal and political hurdles are significant. The question requires only one state to successfully remove or block Trump for a 'Yes' resolution, which increases the likelihood. However, given the controversial nature of such a move, the likely legal challenges, and the historical precedent, it seems more probable that Trump will remain on all state ballots by the resolution date.

Legal precedent: There is no modern precedent for disqualifying a presidential candidate under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This lack of precedent makes it more challenging for states to take such action. 2. Political climate: The current political environment is highly polarized, which could motivate some states to attempt disqualification. However, it could also lead to strong pushback against such efforts. 3. Ongoing legal challenges: Trump is currently facing multiple legal challenges, including federal indictments. While these don't directly relate to the 14th Amendment, they could influence public and political opinion. 4. State autonomy: Each state has its own election laws and processes. Some states might be more inclined to attempt disqualification than others. 5. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the 2024 presidential election.

Strategic significance: Chasiv Yar is a key defensive position for Ukraine, protecting the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. Russia sees it as a stepping stone for further advances in the Donetsk region. 3. Time frame: The question asks about the situation approximately 13 months from now, which is a considerable amount of time in the context of this war. 4. Recent Russian offensive: Russia has been conducting a renewed offensive in the Donetsk region, making slow but steady progress in some areas. 5. Ukrainian defenses: Ukraine has fortified Chasiv Yar and has shown strong resistance in defending key positions. 6. International support: The level of Western support for Ukraine may influence the outcome, but it's uncertain how this will evolve over the next year. 7. Russian military capabilities: Russia has shown the ability to sustain long-term offensive operations, albeit with high costs. 8.

Current political climate: The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports independence, remains the largest party in Scotland.

UK Government stance: The UK Government, led by the Conservative Party, has consistently opposed a second independence referendum. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has stated that now is not the time for another referendum. 3. Legal barriers: The UK Supreme Court ruled in November 2022 that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate for a referendum without Westminster's consent. 4.

Previous referendum: The 2014 independence referendum was described as a 'once in a generation' event by pro-independence leaders, which the UK government often cites as a reason not to hold another so soon.

In 2023, they qualified for the final and finished in 23rd place. This shows they are capable of qualifying and have had recent success. 3. Quality of entry: As of now, we don't know the specific song or artist for Portugal's 2024 entry. The quality of the entry plays a significant role in qualification chances. 4. Competition: The level of competition in the semi-final can affect qualification chances. We don't know yet which countries will be in Portugal's semi-final. 5. Voting patterns: Portugal often receives support from Spanish-speaking countries and former colonies, which can help in qualification. 6. Qualification system: 10 countries from each semi-final qualify for the final, out of approximately 15-18 countries per semi-final. This gives each country a reasonable chance of qualifying. 7. Preparation time: With the resolution date in May 2024, Portugal has ample time to select a strong entry and prepare a good performance. Given Portugal's relatively consistent qualification record in recent years, their ability to occasionally produce standout entries, and the general qualification odds in the semi-finals, I believe Portugal has a good chance of advancing to the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final. However, without knowing the specific entry or semi-final draw, there is still a significant element of uncertainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.02433313948627236, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.01216656974313618, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2215244102581922, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of this occurring, but with significant uncertainty: 1. Kenya has shown commitment to the mission, which increases the likelihood. 2. The international community recognizes the urgent need in Haiti, which could expedite the process. 3. However, the extremely short timeframe (less than 10 days) significantly reduces the probability. 4. The complexity of international deployments and potential for last-minute issues also lowers the likelihood. Considering all these factors, I would estimate a moderate to low probability of this event occurring within the specified timeframe."}}}, "para_P": {"question": {"id": "bd1a0d87-2dac-433d-adac-f7b3ee3b9911", "title": "Will a minimum of 50 Kenyan military or law enforcement officers reach Haiti before June 1, 2024?", "body": "This inquiry will conclude as **Yes** if, between May 22, 2024, and June 1, 2024, trustworthy sources confirm that no fewer than 50 Kenyan military or police officers have reached Haiti.", "resolution_date": "2024-06-03T16:06:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-05-23T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.75, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of this event occurring, we need to consider several factors: 1. Current situation in Haiti: Haiti has been facing severe security challenges, with gang violence and political instability. There's been an international call for assistance to help stabilize the country. 2. Kenya's commitment: Kenya has previously expressed willingness to lead a multinational security force in Haiti. In October 2023, Kenya's parliament approved the deployment of 1,000 police officers to Haiti as part of a UN-backed mission. 3. Timeline: The question asks about a deployment before June 1, 2024, which is about a year from the current date. This provides a significant amount of time for planning and execution. 4. International support: The UN and several countries, including the United States, have backed the idea of a Kenya-led mission to Haiti. 5. Potential obstacles: - Legal challenges: There have been some legal challenges to Kenya's deployment in their domestic courts. - Logistical issues: Deploying forces to a distant country like Haiti requires significant planning and resources. - Political changes: Changes in either Kenyan or Haitian politics could affect the deployment. 6. Scale of deployment: The question only requires 50 officers to reach Haiti, which is a relatively small number compared to the 1,000 approved by Kenya's parliament. 7. Recent developments: As of May 2023, there haven't been reports of Kenyan forces arriving in Haiti yet, but preparations are likely ongoing. Given these factors, I believe there's a good chance that at least 50 Kenyan officers will reach Haiti before June 1, 2024. The long timeline, international support, and Kenya's expressed commitment are positive factors. The small number of officers required (50) also makes it more achievable. However, the potential obstacles and the fact that the deployment hasn't started yet introduce some uncertainty."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.176656285535155, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0883281427675775, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.6201736729460423, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
