Current status: Glenn Youngkin is the Governor of Virginia, elected in 2021. He has gained some national attention as a Republican who won in a traditionally Democratic-leaning state. 2. Competition: The Republican field for 2024 is already crowded with high-profile candidates. Former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are currently seen as the frontrunners, with others like Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, and Vivek Ramaswamy also in the race. 3. Youngkin's intentions: As of now, Youngkin has not officially declared his candidacy for the 2024 presidential race. He has focused on his role as governor and has not made overt moves towards a presidential run. 4. Name recognition: While Youngkin has gained some national attention, his name recognition is still relatively low compared to other potential candidates like Trump, DeSantis, or even some of the declared candidates. 5. Fundraising and support: Without an official campaign, Youngkin lacks the established fundraising networks and national support base that other candidates have been building. 6. Timing: With the Republican National Convention typically held in the summer before the election (likely July or August 2024), there is still time for Youngkin to enter the race. However, the later he enters, the more challenging it becomes to build momentum and support. 7. Party dynamics: The Republican Party is currently navigating internal divisions, particularly regarding Trump's influence. Youngkin's moderate image could appeal to some, but might not resonate with the party's more conservative base. Given these factors, the probability of Glenn Youngkin becoming the Republican nominee appears quite low. He is not currently in the race, faces strong competition from established candidates, and would need to overcome significant hurdles in terms of name recognition and party support. While it's not impossible for him to enter the race and gain momentum, the odds are stacked against him at this point."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "1c0c80bf-e8ef-4602-917d-db2226c9870e", "title": "Will Larry Elder be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if Larry Elder is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a significant advantage in the primary process. 2. Current intentions: As of now (July 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He officially launched his re-election campaign in April 2023. 3.

Current political landscape: As of now, former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are considered the frontrunners for the Republican nomination. They have significant name recognition, established support bases, and fundraising capabilities. 2. Vivek Ramaswamy's profile: Ramaswamy is a relatively new face in politics. He's a successful entrepreneur and author but lacks significant political experience. While this outsider status might appeal to some voters, it could also be seen as a disadvantage in a high-stakes presidential race. 3. Competition: Besides Trump and DeSantis, there are other experienced politicians like Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, and potentially others who might enter the race. These candidates have more political experience and established networks within the Republican Party. 4. Polling data: Current polls show Ramaswamy with low single-digit support, far behind Trump and DeSantis. While polls can change, overcoming such a large gap would be a significant challenge. 5. Fundraising: Presidential campaigns require substantial financial resources. While Ramaswamy has personal wealth, it's unclear if he can match the fundraising capabilities of more established candidates. 6. Party establishment support: Typically, the Republican Party tends to favor candidates with more traditional political backgrounds. Ramaswamy's unconventional background might make it difficult to gain widespread party support. 7. Time until convention: There is still considerable time until the Republican National Convention in 2024. This gives Ramaswamy time to build his profile and support, but it also allows for other candidates to emerge or current frontrunners to solidify their positions. 8. Potential for unexpected events: Political landscapes can change rapidly due to unforeseen circumstances, scandals, or shifts in public opinion. While this introduces uncertainty, the probability of such events benefiting Ramaswamy specifically remains low. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Ramaswamy to secure the nomination, it appears highly unlikely.

Name recognition: While Youngkin has gained some national attention, particularly after his gubernatorial victory in Virginia, his name recognition is still relatively low compared to other potential candidates.

Policy positions: Ramaswamy has taken some unconventional positions that may appeal to certain segments of the Republican base but might not have broad appeal across the party. 6. Time until convention: There is still a considerable amount of time until the Republican National Convention in 2024, which means there is potential for significant changes in the political landscape. 7. Unpredictability of politics: Political races can be unpredictable, and unexpected events or shifts in public opinion can dramatically alter a candidate's chances. Given these factors, it appears highly unlikely that Vivek Ramaswamy will secure the Republican nomination.

Development of Olympic programs: Some countries have been investing in their Olympic programs and may be on the verge of breakthrough performances. 6.

Given these factors, while it's certainly possible for 5 or more countries to win their first Olympic medal in Paris 2024, it seems unlikely.

This means that the 5 or more countries winning their first gold medal will contribute to the count of countries winning their first Olympic medal. 4. The question then becomes whether these same 5+ countries will be the only ones winning their first Olympic medal, or if there might be additional countries winning their first silver or bronze medals. 5.

Given these factors, it seems quite plausible that fewer than 5 countries would win their first gold medal. This condition actually increases the likelihood of the outcome, as it suggests that there are still several countries capable of winning medals but not quite reaching gold. The outcome of at least 5 countries winning their first-ever Olympic medal is more likely. Even if fewer countries are breaking through to gold, there's a good chance that several countries could win their first silver or bronze medals. This is especially true in team sports or events with multiple medals awarded. However, we should also consider that the number of countries without any Olympic medals is decreasing over time, which makes it progressively harder for new countries to join the list of medal-winners.

Likelihood of a Democratic debate: The Democratic National Convention is typically held in August, and as of now, President Biden is the presumptive nominee. The likelihood of a debate between potential Democratic nominees before the convention is low, as the party generally tries to present a united front. However, given recent concerns about Biden's age and performance, there's a small possibility that pressure could mount for such a debate. 2. Biden's current standing: Despite some concerns, Biden remains the party's frontrunner and has significant support from the Democratic establishment. Most Democratic leaders, including Senators, have publicly backed his re-election bid. 3. Time frame: The scenario gives us only about 18 days (from July 2 to July 20) for events to unfold. This is a very short period for such a significant shift in party dynamics. 4. Party unity: Democrats are generally focused on maintaining unity to face the Republican challenger. A mass call for Biden to drop out would be highly unusual and potentially damaging to the party's chances in the general election. 5. Precedent: There's no recent precedent for such a large number of sitting Senators from the same party calling for their party's incumbent president to drop out of the race. 6. Conditional nature of the question: The scenario only comes into play if there is indeed a debate, which itself is unlikely. Given these factors, while it's not impossible, it's highly improbable that 10 or more Democratic Senators would call for Biden to drop out in this scenario.

Lack of debates: The absence of Democratic debates reduces the chances of a public forum where Biden's performance might be questioned, which could potentially trigger calls for him to step down. Time frame: The period until July 20 is relatively short, leaving little time for a significant shift in party sentiment. Biden's age and performance: Concerns about Biden's age and occasional gaffes have been present, but haven't led to widespread calls for him to drop out so far. Lack of strong alternatives: While some Democrats like Harris, Newsom, or Whitmer are mentioned, none have emerged as a clear, preferred alternative to Biden. Party unity: Democrats are likely to prioritize party unity in the face of a contentious general election, making it less likely for Senators to publicly call for Biden to drop out. Electoral considerations: With the general election approaching, Democrats may be hesitant to create instability by calling for a change in candidate. Precedent: It's highly unusual for sitting Senators to call for an incumbent president of their own party to drop out, especially in such numbers.

The probability of death occurring in such a narrow window is quite low for any individual, barring known terminal illnesses or immediate life-threatening situations. 5.

Chasiv Yar's proximity to the frontline makes it vulnerable, but it has been under Ukrainian control for a long time despite being close to Russian-held territory. 3. The 13-month timeframe is significant, allowing for potential changes in the war's dynamics. However, given the recent pace of the conflict, dramatic shifts are less likely. 4. Russia has struggled to make significant advances in recent months, and there's no strong indication that this will change dramatically in the near future. 5. Ukraine has shown resilience and has been successful in defending its territory, particularly in urban areas. 6. While US support is crucial, other Western allies are also committed to supporting Ukraine, which would likely continue even if there were changes in US leadership. Considering all these factors, I believe it's unlikely that Russia will control Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024. While the situation could change, the current trends and Ukraine's demonstrated ability to defend its territory suggest that Chasiv Yar is more likely to remain under Ukrainian control."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "03023d6d-7b02-4732-af05-7619ee6bbdc3", "title": "Suppose Joe Biden does not announce by July 15, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic nomination.

Russian military capabilities: Russia has shown the ability to sustain a long-term military campaign, but has also faced significant losses and logistical challenges. 5. Ukrainian resistance and Western support: Ukraine has demonstrated strong resistance and continues to receive support from Western allies, which has been crucial in holding off Russian advances. 6. The condition about Joe Biden: This condition seems unrelated to the military situation in Ukraine, so it likely won't have a direct impact on the outcome. Given these factors, it's difficult to predict with certainty what the situation will be in June 2024. However, considering the current pace of the conflict and the strategic importance of Chasiv Yar, there's a significant chance that Russia could capture it within the next year if they maintain their focus on this area. That said, Ukraine has shown resilience in defending key positions and has successfully conducted counteroffensives. The continued support from Western allies could also bolster Ukraine's defensive capabilities.

Ongoing investigation: The Georgia case is still active, and prosecutors may continue to gather evidence and potentially add charges. 3.

For example, he has made comments on social media platforms about potential witnesses in various cases against him. 4. Time frame: The resolution date is June 1, 2024, which gives prosecutors over a year to bring additional charges if they find evidence of witness tampering. 5. Legal scrutiny: Given Trump's high profile and the political nature of the case, prosecutors will likely be very cautious about bringing additional charges without strong evidence. 6. Witness protection: The Georgia prosecutors have already taken steps to protect witnesses, which suggests they are concerned about potential tampering or intimidation. 7. Precedent: In other cases involving Trump, such as the federal case related to the January 6 insurrection, prosecutors have raised concerns about potential witness tampering. However, there are also factors that reduce the likelihood of witness tampering charges: 1. Existing charges: Prosecutors may feel that the current charges are sufficient and may not want to complicate the case further. 2. Burden of proof: Witness tampering can be difficult to prove, especially if it's based on public statements rather than direct communication. 3. Political considerations: Adding more charges could be seen as overreach by some and might complicate the prosecution's strategy. 4.

The recent attack by Iran on Israel (April 13-14, 2024) has dramatically escalated tensions. 2. Historical precedent: Israel has been known to conduct covert operations and targeted strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities and military assets in the past. However, these operations have typically been more limited in scope and have not resulted in high casualty numbers within Iran's borders. 3. Time frame: The question provides a relatively short window (about 2.5 weeks) for such an attack to occur. This limited timeframe reduces the likelihood of a major operation being planned and executed. 4. International pressure: Following Iran's attack on Israel, there is likely to be significant international pressure on both sides to de-escalate the situation. This could potentially deter Israel from carrying out a large-scale attack within Iran. 5. Strategic considerations: Israel may prefer to focus on defensive measures and limited retaliatory strikes rather than risking a full-scale war by conducting a deadly attack within Iran's borders. 6. Potential for covert operations: Israel might opt for more discreet methods of retaliation, such as cyberattacks or sabotage, which are less likely to result in multiple casualties. 7. Risk of escalation: A deadly attack within Iran's borders could lead to further escalation and potentially draw other regional powers into the conflict, which Israel may want to avoid. Given these factors, while the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran cannot be ruled out entirely, the likelihood of a deadly attack resulting in at least five casualties within Iran's borders in this short timeframe seems relatively low.

Incumbent advantage: Historically, sitting presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless faced with significant challenges or health issues. Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There have been ongoing concerns about his age and mental acuity, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current statements and actions: As of now, Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election. His campaign has already begun preparations for the 2024 race, including fundraising and organizing efforts. 4. Party support: The Democratic Party leadership has generally rallied behind Biden, and there is no strong push from within the party for him to step aside. 5. Polling and approval ratings: While Biden's approval ratings have fluctuated, they haven't reached a level that would typically force an incumbent to step down. 6. Lack of strong alternatives: There is no clear frontrunner within the Democratic Party who could easily step in if Biden were to withdraw. 7. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively late in the election cycle. Most major decisions about running would likely be made earlier to allow for proper campaign preparation. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Biden would announce he will not accept the nomination. His consistent statements about running, the party's support, and the lack of a clear alternative all point towards him continuing his campaign. The main factor that could change this would be a significant health issue, but there's no strong evidence to suggest this is imminent."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "e93366d5-e780-4c48-a3f9-b61177abfdc0", "title": "Will the Republican Party retain Ohio's 6th congressional district (previously held by Bill Johnson) in the 2024 special election?", "body": "This question will resolve as Yes if credible sources report that a person representing the Republican Party has won the special election for OH's 6th district.

Bill Johnson, a Republican, held the seat from 2011 until his recent resignation to become president of Youngstown State University. 2. District demographics: The 6th district covers a large rural area in eastern Ohio, which typically leans conservative and has been supportive of Republican candidates. 3. Previous election results: In the 2022 midterm elections, Bill Johnson won with 67.9% of the vote, indicating strong Republican support in the district. 4. National political climate: While national trends can influence local elections, this district has remained solidly Republican even during years when Democrats performed well nationally. 5. Candidate quality: While we don't know the specific candidates yet, the Republican Party is likely to field a strong candidate given the importance of maintaining this seat. 6. Timing of the special election: Special elections can sometimes produce surprising results due to lower turnout, but the Republican advantage in this district is significant enough to likely overcome this factor. 7. Redistricting: The district boundaries have not changed significantly in recent redistricting efforts, maintaining its Republican-leaning composition. 8. Local issues: The district includes areas affected by manufacturing decline and energy industry changes, which have traditionally aligned with Republican messaging. Given these factors, especially the historical voting patterns, the strong Republican performance in recent elections, and the district's demographic composition, it seems highly likely that the Republican Party will retain this seat in the special election.

The conditional nature of the question: The scenario assumes that the Republican Party retains Ohio's 6th congressional district in the special election. This could be seen as a potential indicator of Republican strength or Democratic weakness in a traditionally competitive state. 2. Ohio's political significance: Ohio is a crucial swing state in presidential elections. A Republican win in the 6th district might be interpreted as a sign of broader Republican support in the state. 3. Joe Biden's current position: As of now (early 2024), Biden has indicated his intention to run for re-election, despite concerns about his age and approval ratings. 4. Timing: The question specifies an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). 5. Political strategy: A decision to not accept the nomination would be a major shift in strategy for the Democratic Party, requiring careful consideration of alternative candidates. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that Biden would announce he won't accept the nomination, even if Republicans retain Ohio's 6th district. Here's why: a) One congressional district result, while potentially indicative, is not typically enough to cause a dramatic shift in presidential campaign strategy. b) Biden and the Democratic Party have invested significant political capital in his re-election bid. A last-minute change would be highly disruptive. c) The timing (before July 15) leaves little room for the party to coalesce around an alternative candidate before the convention. d) Historically, incumbent presidents rarely drop out of re-election bids, especially this late in the process. e) Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run, and his team has been actively campaigning. However, we must acknowledge that political landscapes can shift rapidly, and there's always a possibility of unexpected events or health issues that could change the situation. The Republican win in Ohio might also be part of a broader trend that could influence Biden's decision.

A loss here for the Republicans would be significant but not necessarily catastrophic for the party or indicative of a national trend. 3.

He has announced his intention to run for re-election and his campaign is actively working towards that goal. 2. Age and health: Biden is currently 80 years old and would be 82 at the start of a second term. While his age has been a topic of discussion, there have been no major health concerns that would suggest he's likely to drop out. 3.

These candidates have higher name recognition and larger support bases. 3. Polling: As of now, Will Hurd is not registering significant support in national polls. He is often not even included in many polls, which indicates his low visibility among voters. 4. Fundraising: While exact figures are not available, it's likely that Hurd's fundraising capabilities are far behind those of front-runners like Trump and DeSantis. 5. Party alignment: Hurd is known for his moderate stance on some issues and has been critical of Donald Trump. This puts him at odds with a significant portion of the Republican base that still strongly supports Trump. 6.

Likelihood of Will Hurd becoming the Republican nominee: Will Hurd is a former CIA officer and congressman from Texas who has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican nomination. However, he is currently considered a long-shot candidate, with much lower name recognition and support compared to frontrunners like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others. The probability of Hurd securing the nomination is very low. 2. Biden's current position and intentions: Joe Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He has the advantage of incumbency and currently has the full support of the Democratic Party. There have been no significant indications that he plans to drop out of the race. 3. Impact of Hurd's hypothetical nomination on Biden's decision: If Hurd were to secure the Republican nomination (which is highly unlikely), it would likely be seen as a positive development for Biden's campaign. Hurd is a moderate Republican who has been critical of Trump, which could potentially split the Republican vote. This scenario would not provide any additional incentive for Biden to drop out. 4. Biden's health and age: Biden's age (he would be 82 at the start of a second term) has been a concern for some voters. However, he has maintained that he is fit for office, and there have been no major health issues that would suggest he needs to drop out. 5. Timeline: The question asks about Biden dropping out before July 20, which is relatively early in the campaign season. Major party candidates typically do not drop out this early unless there are exceptional circumstances. Given these factors, even in the unlikely event that Will Hurd becomes the Republican nominee, there is very little reason to believe that Biden would drop out of the race, especially not before July 20.

The end of July 2024 is well within his first term. 3. Historical precedent: It is rare for a U.S. President not to complete their term. Only 9 out of 45 presidents have not completed their terms (due to death or resignation). 4. Biden's age and health: Biden is currently 80 years old, making him the oldest serving president. While his age raises some concerns about his health, he has not shown any severe health issues that would likely prevent him from serving through July 2024. 5. Political landscape: There are no significant political movements or impeachment proceedings that threaten Biden's presidency at this time. 6. Resignation likelihood: There's no indication that Biden intends to resign. Presidents typically don't resign unless facing extreme circumstances (e.g., Nixon and Watergate). 7. 25th Amendment: The question specifies that a temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment does not affect the resolution, so we don't need to consider this possibility. 8. Time frame: The period in question is relatively short (less than a year from now), which reduces the likelihood of unexpected events occurring. Given these factors, the probability of Biden remaining President through the end of July 2024 is quite high.

Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There have been concerns about his age and cognitive abilities, which could potentially influence his decision. 3. Current political climate: As of July 2024, Biden's approval ratings and the overall political landscape will play a crucial role in his decision. If his popularity is low or if there are significant challenges facing the country, it might influence his choice. 4. Party support: The Democratic Party's stance and potential alternative candidates will be important factors. If there's strong support for Biden within the party, it's less likely he would step aside. 5.

Considering these factors, it seems unlikely that Biden would announce he will not accept the nomination so close to the convention date.

Likelihood of Biden not seeking re-election: While Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election, there's always a possibility he could change his mind due to health concerns or other factors. However, this probability is relatively low, especially this close to the election. 2. Impact on polling if Biden withdraws: If Biden were to announce he's not seeking re-election, it would likely cause significant volatility in the polls. The Democratic Party would need to quickly coalesce around a new candidate, which could temporarily benefit Trump in the polls. 3. Trump's current polling status: As of now (July 2023), Trump generally leads Biden in national polls, but the margin varies. FiveThirtyEight's polling average typically shows a closer race than some other aggregators. 4. Specific polling margin: The question asks for a very specific margin (between 2 and 3 points). This narrow range makes the probability lower, as even if Trump is leading, it might not fall precisely in this range. 5. Time frame: The short time frame between Biden's hypothetical announcement and the polling date (July 15, 2024) means there would be limited time for polls to fully adjust to the new reality. Given these factors, I believe there's a small but not negligible chance of this scenario occurring. If Biden were to withdraw, it would likely boost Trump's numbers in the short term.

Political landscape: The Republican opposition, including the potential return of Donald Trump as a candidate, may motivate Biden to run again to prevent a Republican victory. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively late in the election cycle. By this time, primary elections will have already begun, making it highly unlikely for an incumbent to drop out so late. 7. Historical precedent: It is extremely rare for an incumbent president to decline nomination this late in the process. The last time this happened was with Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, under very different circumstances. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he will not accept the nomination before July 15, 2024. While concerns about his age and health are valid, his current actions and statements, along with party support and the late timing specified in the question, all point towards him continuing his re-election bid."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "6520da8a-818c-449b-b777-be84551409ec", "title": "Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?", "body": "Resolves **Yes** if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\n\n - Donald Trump\n - Donald Trump Jr.\n - Eric Trump\n - Ivanka Trump\n - Tiffany Trump\n - Melania Trump\n - Barron Trump", "resolution_date": "2024-07-15T22:20:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2020-05-09T10:00:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of a Trump family member becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential election, we need to consider several factors: 1.

From 2015 to 2023, Greece qualified 7 out of 8 times (excluding 2020 when the contest was cancelled), while Lithuania qualified 4 out of 8 times. 7. Consistency: Greece has been more consistent in qualifying for the final over the past two decades, suggesting a stronger Eurovision strategy and fan base. Given these factors, especially Greece's stronger historical performance and more consistent qualification record, there is a good chance that Greece would qualify if Lithuania does.

Semi-final allocation: The semi-final allocation for 2024 hasn't been announced yet, which could impact their chances. Some semi-finals can be more competitive than others. 4. Quality of entry: We don't know the song or artist for 2024 yet, which is a crucial factor in determining qualification chances. 5. Voting patterns: Armenia often benefits from diaspora voting and has good relationships with several countries that consistently vote for them. 6. Competition level: The overall quality of entries from other countries in 2024 is unknown, which could affect Armenia's relative standing. 7. Potential changes in format or voting system: Any changes to the Eurovision format or voting system could impact qualification chances, but no major changes have been announced for 2024. Given Armenia's strong historical performance, recent success, and consistent ability to qualify, there's a good reason to be optimistic about their chances. However, the uncertainties surrounding the specific entry, semi-final allocation, and competition level for 2024 prevent us from being overly confident.

Biden's intention to serve: Biden has consistently expressed his intention to serve his full term and has not shown any signs of planning to step down. 5. Planned medical procedures: There are no publicly known major medical procedures scheduled for Biden during this time frame that might necessitate a transfer of power. 6. Political climate: Barring any unforeseen circumstances, it's unlikely that there would be any political pressure for Biden to step down or transfer power so close to the 2024 election. 7. 25th Amendment invocation: While this could theoretically happen, it's typically used for very short periods (hours or days) during planned medical procedures. The likelihood of it being invoked for an extended period in this specific timeframe is low.

Likelihood of Biden not remaining President: While this is hypothetical in the question, we need to consider the realistic probability of such an event occurring. Biden is currently 80 years old and will be 81 by July 2024. While his health has generally been reported as good, advanced age does increase health risks. 3. Time frame: The period in question is relatively short (from the creation date to July 26, 2024), which reduces the likelihood of unforeseen events. 4. Political stability: The U.S. has a stable political system with clear succession rules, making it highly likely that if Biden were to leave office, Harris would immediately assume the role. 5. Historical precedent: In U.S. history, every time a President has left office mid-term (through death or resignation), the Vice President has immediately assumed the role. Given these factors, if Biden were to leave office before the end of July 2024, it is extremely likely that Kamala Harris would become either President or Acting President before July 26, 2024. The constitutional mechanisms for this transition are clear and well-established, and there are no foreseeable obstacles that would prevent or significantly delay Harris from assuming the role.

Given that the deadline is July 5, 2024, which is more than a year away, there's a significant amount of time for the EU to complete its investigations and make a decision. The growing pressure from European automakers and the need to protect the EU's automotive industry make it more likely that some form of tariffs will be announced.

Their recent improvement (qualifying in 2021 and 2022) is a positive sign, but the failure to qualify in 2023 and the lack of information about their 2024 entry make it difficult to be overly optimistic.

Trump vs. Biden vs. Generic Democrat: Historically, incumbent presidents tend to have an advantage over generic opponents due to name recognition and a concrete record to run on. However, Joe Biden is a known quantity, and opinions about him are likely to be more firmly set than those about a generic Democrat. 3. Current political climate: As of July 2024, the political landscape may be significantly different from what it is now (July 2023). Factors such as the economy, foreign policy issues, and domestic policies could greatly influence public opinion. 4. Trump's position: Trump's legal issues and controversies might affect his standing, but he also maintains a strong base of support. His performance against Biden vs. a generic Democrat could depend on how polarizing Biden is perceived to be compared to an unnamed alternative. 5.

Trump vs. Biden vs. Generic Democrat: The question asks about Trump's performance against Biden compared to a generic Democrat. Historically, named candidates often perform differently than generic party representatives in polls. 3. Manifold respondents: The polls are specifically among Manifold respondents, who may have different characteristics or biases compared to the general population. 4.

He has a record to defend and a known personality, which could work for or against him. - Trump, having been president before, might perform better against a known quantity (Biden) than against an undefined 'generic' Democrat who could be imagined as an ideal candidate by some voters. - However, the 3% threshold is quite high.

National politics: The performance of Green parties varies significantly across EU member states. While they have seen some success in countries like Germany and France, they are not dominant forces in many other EU countries. 5. Competing issues: While climate change remains a significant concern, other issues such as economic recovery post-COVID, inflation, and security concerns related to the war in Ukraine may take precedence for many voters. 6. Electoral system: The proportional representation system used in European Parliament elections makes it difficult for any single group to gain a dominant position. 7. Time until the election: With the election still about a year away, there's potential for significant shifts in public opinion. However, such a dramatic shift as would be required for the Greens\u2013EFA to become the largest group seems unlikely. Given these factors, it appears highly improbable that the Greens\u2013EFA will hold the most seats after the 2024 European Parliamentary Elections.

Historical performance: GUE/NGL has never been the largest group in the European Parliament since its formation. It typically represents far-left and communist parties, which have limited appeal across the broader European electorate. 3. Political trends: There's no strong indication of a major shift towards far-left politics across Europe that would suggest GUE/NGL could become the largest group. 4. Condition of Greens-EFA not holding the most seats: This condition doesn't significantly impact the likelihood of GUE/NGL holding the most seats, as Greens-EFA is also not one of the largest groups (currently 72 seats). 5. Other major groups: Even if there were significant shifts in voting patterns, it's more likely that one of the currently larger groups (EPP, S&D, Renew Europe) or a rising populist right group would gain the most seats rather than GUE/NGL. 6. Fragmentation of the left: The left-wing vote in Europe is often split between multiple groups (S&D, Greens-EFA, GUE/NGL), making it less likely for any single left-wing group to dominate.

Democratic lawmakers pressuring Biden: The political climate described in the Politico report suggests growing discontent among Democrats regarding Biden's re-election prospects. However, publicly calling for a sitting president to drop out is a significant and rare move. While there are drafts of letters circulating, it's uncertain if 5 named lawmakers will actually sign and send such a letter. The requirement for all 5 to be part of the same group message makes this even more challenging. Given the high stakes and potential backlash, many lawmakers might be hesitant to take such a bold step. 2. Nvidia vs Apple market cap: As of July 2023, Apple's market cap is significantly larger than Nvidia's (Apple ~$3 trillion, Nvidia ~$1 trillion). For Nvidia to surpass Apple by July 2024, it would require extraordinary growth for Nvidia and/or a significant decline for Apple. While Nvidia has shown impressive growth due to AI advancements, overtaking Apple within a year is a tall order. Apple's diverse product line and strong brand loyalty provide it with stability.

Let's break it down: 1. First, we need to consider the likelihood of Vivek Ramaswamy becoming the Republican nominee. As of now (2023), this seems highly unlikely. Ramaswamy is a relatively new face in politics and lacks the widespread recognition and support that other potential Republican candidates have. 2. However, for the sake of this question, we are assuming that Ramaswamy does become the nominee. This hypothetical scenario would likely indicate a significant shift in the Republican party's dynamics and voter preferences. 3. Now, we need to consider how Trump's polling numbers against Biden would look in this scenario. This is challenging because: a) Trump is not the Republican nominee in this scenario. b) We're looking at a very specific polling lead range (between 3 and 4 points) on a specific date (July 15, 2024). 4. Given that Trump is not the nominee, his polling numbers against Biden would likely be hypothetical or based on general popularity rather than an actual head-to-head election matchup. 5. The specificity of the polling lead (3-4 points) makes this scenario even less likely. Polls can fluctuate significantly, especially months before an election, and pinpointing such a narrow range is challenging. 6. Additionally, the political landscape could change dramatically between now and July 2024, affecting both Trump's and Biden's popularity in ways we cannot predict. 7. It's also worth noting that if Ramaswamy were to become the nominee, it might significantly alter Trump's standing within the Republican party and among voters, potentially affecting his polling numbers against Biden in unpredictable ways. Given all these factors, the likelihood of this specific scenario occurring seems extremely low. The combination of Ramaswamy becoming the nominee (already a low probability event) and Trump having a lead over Biden in a very specific 1-point range on a specific date, despite not being the nominee, is a highly improbable scenario."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "4deb920c-fa3e-47e6-b79d-7cfb3f282851", "title": "Given Vivek Ramaswamy is not the Republican nominee, will Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Vivek Ramaswamy is not selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Potential for other candidates: The question allows for any Republican nominee other than Ramaswamy, which could include candidates who might perform differently against Biden compared to Trump. 7. 538's methodology: 538 is known for its rigorous polling aggregation, which tends to smooth out outliers and provide a balanced view of the race. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that Trump's lead will fall exactly in the 3 to 4 point range on the specific date mentioned. While it's certainly possible that Trump could be leading Biden in July 2024, the range is too narrow to assign a high probability. There's a much higher chance that Trump's lead (if he has one) would be either smaller or larger than this specific range.

This gives them a historical qualification rate of about 43%. 2. Recent performance: Latvia has failed to qualify for the Grand Final in the last seven consecutive contests (2017-2023). This recent track record is not favorable. 3. Quality of entry: As of now, we don't know what Latvia's entry for 2024 will be. The song and performer quality are crucial factors in determining qualification chances. 4. Semi-final draw: The distribution of countries in each semi-final can affect qualification chances. We don't know this information for 2024 yet. 5. Voting patterns: Latvia sometimes benefits from votes from neighboring Baltic countries and the Nordic region, but this hasn't been enough to secure qualification in recent years. 6. Changes in format or voting system: Any changes to the Eurovision format or voting system could impact Latvia's chances, but no significant changes have been announced for 2024 as of now. 7. Potential for improvement: Given their recent poor performance, Latvia may be motivated to send a stronger entry to improve their chances. Considering these factors, Latvia's chances of qualifying are not particularly high based on recent history. However, Eurovision results can be unpredictable, and a strong entry could significantly improve their odds. Without knowing the specifics of their 2024 entry or the semi-final distribution, it's difficult to be very confident in either direction. Given the recent trend and historical performance, but also accounting for the potential for improvement and the inherent unpredictability of the contest, I would estimate the probability of Latvia qualifying for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024 to be slightly below 50%."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "93f1fa46-2c97-4f57-9714-7bf862b14e15", "title": "Conditional on Latvia qualifying for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024, will Australia also qualify?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Latvia participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

Eurovision participation: Both Latvia and Australia have been regular participants in Eurovision in recent years. Latvia has participated since 2000, while Australia has been a participant since 2015. 2. Qualification process: Eurovision typically has two semi-finals, from which countries qualify for the Grand Final. The 'Big Five' (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) and the host country automatically qualify for the Grand Final. 3. Historical performance: Latvia has struggled to qualify for the Grand Final in recent years, last qualifying in 2016. Australia has had a strong track record, qualifying for the Grand Final in all but one of their appearances (2021). 4. Conditional nature of the question: The question assumes Latvia qualifies, which is less likely based on recent history. This doesn't directly affect Australia's chances but might indicate a potentially more competitive year. 5. Australia's consistent performance: Despite not qualifying in 2021, Australia has generally been well-received in Eurovision, often finishing in the top 10. 6. Time until the event: As of the question's creation date, there's still about a year until Eurovision 2024. This leaves time for changes in national selection processes, song quality, and other factors that could influence qualification. 7. Number of qualifiers: Typically, 10 countries qualify from each semi-final. Australia's consistent performance suggests they have a good chance of being among these 10, regardless of Latvia's performance. 8. Voting patterns: While not directly related, Australia tends to receive votes from a diverse range of countries, which helps its chances of qualification. Given Australia's strong track record in Eurovision, their consistent qualification for the Grand Final (with only one exception), and their generally well-received entries, I believe there is a high probability that Australia will qualify for the Grand Final if they participate in Eurovision 2024.

Historical performance: Ireland has a strong Eurovision history, having won the contest seven times. However, their recent performance has been less impressive. They last qualified for the final in 2018 and have failed to qualify in the last four contests (2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023). 2. Competition format: Eurovision typically has two semi-finals, with 10 countries from each semi-final advancing to the Grand Final. The failure of Cyprus to qualify doesn't directly impact Ireland's chances, as they would likely be in different semi-finals. 3. Current Irish music scene: The strength of Ireland's entry will depend on the artist and song chosen, which is unknown at this time. However, Ireland has a rich musical tradition and could potentially send a strong entry. 4. Voting patterns: Ireland often receives support from the UK and other countries with large Irish diaspora populations. This could help their chances, but it hasn't been enough in recent years. 5. Unpredictability of Eurovision: The contest can be unpredictable, with results often influenced by factors beyond just the quality of the song, such as staging, running order, and geopolitical considerations. 6. Time until the event: As the question is being asked almost a year before the contest, there's a lot of uncertainty about the quality of Ireland's entry and the overall competitive landscape. Given these factors, Ireland's chances of qualifying are not particularly high based on recent performance, but they're not negligible either. The country has the potential to qualify with a strong entry, effective staging, and a bit of luck. However, their recent track record suggests they're more likely to miss out than to qualify. Probability: 0.35 This probability reflects that while Ireland has a chance to qualify, based on recent performance and the competitive nature of Eurovision, it's more likely than not that they will fail to reach the Grand Final.

While names like Harris, Newsom, and Whitmer are mentioned, they have not indicated any intention to run against Biden. 4. Party unity: The Democratic Party is likely focused on presenting a united front against the Republican nominee rather than fostering internal competition. 5. Biden's campaign strategy: Given his incumbency and age, Biden's campaign may prefer to limit his debate appearances to conserve energy and avoid potential gaffes. 6. Precedent: In recent history, when an incumbent president runs for re-election, their party typically does not hold primary debates. However, there are a few factors that could slightly increase the chances of a debate: 1. Concerns about Biden's age and fitness for office might prompt calls for a debate to demonstrate his capabilities. 2. An unexpected challenger could emerge, leading to pressure for a debate. 3. A symbolic or policy-focused debate could be organized to energize the Democratic base, even if Biden's nomination is not seriously contested.

Media landscape and competition: Major news outlets are in fierce competition to break significant stories first. If Biden were to drop out, it would be an enormous news event that all major outlets would be scrambling to report. 3. White House leaks and insider information: Despite efforts to maintain secrecy, the White House and political circles often experience leaks of sensitive information. A decision as momentous as dropping out of the presidential race would likely be known by multiple individuals, increasing the chances of a leak. 4. Media relationships with sources: Reputable news organizations often have well-established relationships with insider sources who might provide early information about such a decision. 5. Time frame: The question specifies at least 6 hours of advance coverage. This is a significant amount of time in the fast-paced world of political news, but not unreasonable for such a major story. 6.

Precedent: In similar situations of late candidate withdrawals, parties have sometimes organized quick debates or forums to allow remaining candidates to present their cases. 4.

Current geopolitical tensions: The relationship between Israel and Iran is historically hostile, with ongoing tensions over Iran's nuclear program and support for groups that oppose Israel. 2. Recent events: The April 13, 2024 Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel has significantly escalated tensions. Israel has vowed to respond, increasing the likelihood of retaliatory action. 3. Time frame: The question gives a relatively short window (about 2.5 weeks) for such an attack to occur. This limits the probability somewhat, as planning and executing a significant attack within this timeframe may be challenging. 4. Historical precedent: Israel has been accused of carrying out covert operations within Iran in the past, including assassinations and sabotage of nuclear facilities. However, these have typically been more targeted and less likely to result in multiple casualties. 5. International pressure: The international community, particularly the United States, may attempt to discourage Israel from escalating the conflict further. This could potentially reduce the likelihood of a large-scale attack. 6. Israeli capabilities: Israel has advanced military capabilities and intelligence networks, making it technically feasible to carry out such an attack if deemed necessary. 7. Risk of wider conflict: A direct attack on Iranian soil with multiple casualties could risk sparking a wider regional conflict, which Israel may want to avoid. 8. Alternative responses: Israel might opt for less direct forms of retaliation, such as cyber attacks or strikes on Iranian proxies in other countries, which would not satisfy the conditions of this question. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of Israel carrying out an attack within Iran before May 1, 2024. The recent Iranian attack on Israel has created a situation where some form of retaliation seems likely. However, the short timeframe, potential international pressure, and the risk of escalation somewhat reduce the probability of an attack meeting the specific criteria (within Iran, causing at least five deaths)."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "02e2bdde-d08b-4cbd-942c-d12aa9a5c290", "title": "If Joe Biden drops out, will a reliable media outlet cover the story at least 6 hours in advance?", "body": "Question resolves YES if a big and reliable media outlet like Associated Press News, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fox News, Reuters, or Washington Post covers the dropout with an unofficial confirmation at least 6 hours before President Joe Biden officially announces his dropout via letter, speech, etc.\n\nLocal news, conspiracy websites, or comments by individual users on Manifold will not be sufficient.\n\nThis market will be resolved as N/A if President Joe Biden does not drop out before the end of the National Democratic Convention.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-22T21:10:22Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-13T22:04:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.75, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of this scenario, we need to consider several factors: 1.

Historical precedent: While it's rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election race, when major political news breaks, it's common for reliable media outlets to report on it ahead of official announcements. Given these factors, if Biden were to drop out, it seems more likely than not that at least one of the mentioned reliable media outlets would cover the story at least 6 hours in advance. The competitive nature of news media, the significance of such an event, and the likelihood of leaks all contribute to this probability.

Given that the question is conditional on Georgia qualifying, which is already a less likely event, and considering Czechia's improved performance in recent years, I believe there's a moderate chance that Czechia would also qualify if Georgia does.

Historical performance: Czechia has had mixed results in Eurovision. They've qualified for the Grand Final 3 times out of 10 attempts since their debut in 2007. This gives them a 30% qualification rate historically. 2. Recent performance: In the last few years, Czechia has shown improvement. They qualified in 2018, 2019, and 2022, missing out in 2021 and 2023. This recent track record is better than their overall history. 3. Competition level: The level of competition in Eurovision can vary year to year. Without knowing the specific competitors and their songs for 2024, it's hard to gauge the exact level of competition Czechia will face. 4. Georgia's non-qualification: The question is conditional on Georgia not qualifying. While this doesn't directly affect Czechia's chances, it could potentially make the competition slightly easier if Georgia was considered a strong contender. 5. Semi-final allocation: The semi-final in which Czechia competes can affect their chances. Some semi-finals can be more competitive than others. 6. Song quality and performance: The quality of Czechia's entry for 2024 is unknown at this time, which is a significant factor in determining qualification chances. 7. Voting patterns: Czechia doesn't have strong voting blocs or diaspora voting, which can sometimes be a disadvantage in Eurovision. Given these factors, I would say Czechia has a moderate chance of qualifying. Their recent performance has been better than their overall history, which is a positive sign.

Public opinion polls vs. Manifold respondents: The prompt mentions that public opinion polls show Biden losing to Trump, while other Democrats fare better. However, we need to determine if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. Manifold users are likely to be more politically engaged and potentially more informed than the average voter, which could lead to different results. 2. Perception of Joe Biden vs. a generic Democrat: Biden has been in office for several years now, and voters have had time to form opinions about his presidency. A generic Democrat, on the other hand, allows voters to project their ideal candidate onto the ballot. This could potentially lead to a higher preference for the generic Democrat over Biden. 3. Trump's performance against Biden vs. a generic Democrat: Given Biden's current approval ratings and the public opinion polls mentioned, it's reasonable to assume that Trump might perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat. However, the question is whether this difference will be 3% or more among Manifold respondents. 4. Manifold user demographics and political leanings: Without specific information about Manifold's user base, it's difficult to predict how they might lean politically. However, users of prediction markets tend to skew younger and more tech-savvy, which could influence their political preferences. 5. Time until poll closure: The polls close on July 6, which is still some time away.

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Trump will gain at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat. The specific nature of Biden's presidency and the current political climate suggest that Trump might indeed perform better against Biden.

Precedent: In previous legal matters, Trump has often avoided testifying or given depositions only under court order. 4.

Current political climate: Trump's base remains loyal, but his legal troubles have been a consistent issue. Testifying might not significantly change opinions that are already largely formed. 3. Comparison to a generic Democrat: Generic candidates often poll better than specific ones because they lack negative associations. Biden, as an incumbent with mixed approval ratings, might poll worse than a generic Democrat. 4. Manifold respondents: These are likely to be more politically engaged and informed than the general public. They might be less swayed by media spectacles and more focused on policy positions. 5.

Trump's involvement in the January 6th events: Trump's actions surrounding the Capitol riot have been scrutinized, and some argue they could fall under the 'insurrection or rebellion' clause of Section 3. 3.

It would remove a significant obstacle to his re-election. 4. Democratic Party dynamics: The party has largely rallied behind Biden as their candidate. A last-minute change would be highly disruptive and unusual. 5. Precedent: There is no historical precedent for an incumbent president dropping out of a race so close to the election, especially when their main opponent faces legal challenges. 6. Biden's health: While concerns about Biden's age and health have been raised, there's no indication that he plans to step down due to health reasons. 7. Ethical considerations: Biden dropping out immediately after Trump is blocked might be seen as opportunistic or unfair, which could damage the Democratic Party's image. 8. Time constraints: Five days is an extremely short period for such a monumental decision, especially considering the need for party consultations and potential replacement candidate selection. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would drop out of the race in this scenario.

Looking at recent trends: - In 2023, monthly increases in Core CPI were often around 0.2% to 0.4%. - In early 2024, the increases have generally been between 0.3% and 0.5%. 3. Federal Reserve's monetary policy: The Federal Reserve has been actively working to control inflation. Their target is 2% annual inflation, which would translate to about 0.17% monthly increase. They may continue to adjust interest rates to achieve this goal. 4. Economic conditions: By July 2024, we might expect some cooling in the economy due to the prolonged effects of higher interest rates. However, the labor market remains strong, which could continue to put upward pressure on prices. 5.

Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that the Core CPI will increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024.

Semi-final allocation: We don't know which semi-final each country will be in, which could affect their chances.

Margin of error: Polls typically have a margin of error, which means small changes within 1-2 points are not uncommon and could easily push the lead in or out of our target range. 6. Regression to the mean: If the current 2.4 point lead is seen as somewhat of an outlier, there might be a tendency for it to move slightly closer to previous averages. Given that the current lead (2.4 points) is already within our target range (>2 and \u22643), and considering the short time frame, it seems reasonably likely that the lead will remain in this range. However, there's also a significant chance it could move slightly above or below this range. The narrow range we're looking for (just a 1-point window) makes this less likely than if we were considering a broader range. There's a good chance the lead could be slightly less than 2 points or slightly more than 3 points. Considering all these factors, I would estimate there's about a 30-40% chance that Trump's lead will be in the specified range on July 15, 2024."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "d55f0246-11f4-4de5-a091-00c338bdaaf8", "title": "Will the  CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS)\t\n be higher Year-over-Year on July 20, 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve based on reporting by the St. Louis Fed here: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VXVCLS.

Historical context: The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) measures the market's expectation of future volatility. It tends to increase during periods of uncertainty and decrease during stable periods. Current economic conditions: As of July 2023, the global economy is still recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential recession. Future outlook: By July 2024, we might expect some of the current economic uncertainties to have resolved, potentially leading to lower volatility. However, new challenges could emerge. Cyclical patterns: Market volatility can follow cyclical patterns, but these are not always predictable. Geopolitical factors: International tensions or conflicts can significantly impact market volatility. Technological advancements: Rapid technological changes can create both opportunities and uncertainties in the market. Climate change: Increasing concerns about climate change and its economic impacts could contribute to market volatility. Election year: 2024 is a U.S. presidential election year, which typically introduces some level of market uncertainty. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher chance that the VXVCLS will be lower in July 2024 compared to July 2023.

Georgia doesn't have as strong a voting bloc, which could make qualification more challenging. 4. Semi-final allocation: The question doesn't specify which semi-finals Estonia and Georgia are in. If they're in different semi-finals, Estonia's qualification wouldn't directly impact Georgia's chances.

Current status: As of now, Tucker Carlson is not a declared candidate for the Republican nomination. He recently left his position at Fox News, which has sparked speculation about his political ambitions. 2. Established candidates: There are already several high-profile Republicans who have declared their candidacy or are expected to run, including Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others. These candidates have significant support within the party and established political networks. 3. Lack of political experience: Carlson has never held elected office, which could be a significant disadvantage in a presidential race. Voters and party officials often prefer candidates with governing experience. 4. Media background: While Carlson has a strong media presence and a dedicated following, transitioning from media personality to presidential nominee is extremely rare and challenging. 5. Time constraints: The Republican National Convention typically occurs in July or August of the election year. Given that it's already 2023 and Carlson hasn't announced any intention to run, he would have limited time to build a campaign infrastructure and gain support among delegates. 6. Party dynamics: The Republican Party leadership and major donors have not shown any significant push for Carlson as a candidate. The party typically rallies around candidates who have been active in party politics. 7. Polling: Current polls do not show Carlson as a top contender for the nomination, with most support going to established political figures. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Tucker Carlson would become the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Genetic and environmental factors: The Kalenjin people are known for their running prowess, which is attributed to a combination of genetic factors, high-altitude training, and cultural emphasis on running. 5. Competition: While Kalenjin athletes are strong contenders, there are excellent marathon runners from other ethnicities and countries who could potentially win. 6. Unpredictability of sports: Olympic events can be unpredictable, with factors like weather conditions, injuries, or unexpected performances playing a role. 7.

Historical precedent: Swimming has traditionally been one of the sports where athletes can win multiple medals in a single Olympics. This is due to the various stroke types and distances, as well as relay events. 2. Recent Olympic performances: In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), Caeleb Dressel (USA) won 5 gold medals in swimming, which was the highest individual gold medal count. However, he didn't win the most overall medals, as that honor went to Emma McKeon (AUS) with 7 medals (4 gold, 3 bronze) in swimming. 3. Dominant swimmers: Currently, there are several exceptional swimmers who could potentially win multiple gold medals, such as Caeleb Dressel (USA), Katie Ledecky (USA), and Ariarne Titmus (AUS). 4. Competition from other sports: The main competition for most gold medals usually comes from gymnastics, athletics (track and field), and sometimes cycling. However, these sports generally offer fewer opportunities for multiple gold medals compared to swimming. 5. Schedule and events: The Olympic schedule and number of events for each sport can impact the potential for multiple medals. Swimming typically has a large number of events spread over several days, giving swimmers multiple opportunities for gold. 6. Team strength: The strength of a country's relay teams can significantly boost a swimmer's medal count. Countries with strong swimming programs like the USA and Australia often perform well in relays. 7. Emerging talents: There's always the possibility of new swimming talents emerging between now and the 2024 Olympics who could dominate the competition. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that a swimmer will win the most gold medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Given these factors, especially the combined star power, the integration into the MCU, and the summer release date, it seems highly likely that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will surpass the combined opening weekend box office of its predecessors.

This trend suggests that audience reception of his recent works has been declining. 2. Shyamalan's reputation: He's known for his twist endings and unique storytelling style. While this has garnered him a dedicated fanbase, it has also led to mixed receptions for many of his films. 3. Genre and expectations: 'Trap' is likely to be a thriller or horror film, given Shyamalan's typical style. These genres often receive lower CinemaScores due to their divisive nature. 4. Trailer reception: The question mentions a 'great trailer.' A well-received trailer can build positive expectations, potentially leading to a better initial audience response. 5. Shyamalan's ability to surprise: He has shown the ability to bounce back with critically and commercially successful films after periods of less well-received work (e.g., 'Split' after a series of poorly received films). 6. CinemaScore tendencies: CinemaScore tends to skew higher for mainstream films, with B being a relatively common score. However, Shyamalan's last two films fell below this mark. Considering these factors, there are reasons to be cautious about predicting a B or higher CinemaScore for 'Trap.' The downward trend in his recent films' scores is concerning, with his last two films falling below the B threshold. However, the positive reception of the trailer and Shyamalan's ability to surprise audiences provide some hope for a better reception.

Nvidia vs Apple market cap: As of September 2023, Apple's market cap is significantly larger than Nvidia's (Apple ~$2.7 trillion, Nvidia ~$1.1 trillion). For Nvidia to overtake Apple by July 2024: - Nvidia would need to continue its explosive growth, driven by AI advancements and chip demand. - Apple would need to underperform or face significant market challenges. While Nvidia has seen remarkable growth, overtaking Apple in less than a year would require an extraordinary shift in market dynamics. Apple's diverse product line and strong brand loyalty provide stability, making such a dramatic overtake less likely.

Consensus building: The WHO typically aims for consensus in its decision-making processes. The fact that the agreement is being put to a vote suggests that a reasonable level of consensus may have already been achieved. 6. Urgency: Given the recent experience with COVID-19 and the potential for future pandemics, there might be a sense of urgency to approve such an agreement. 7.

Current stance: OpenAI has not explicitly committed to the 'no retaliation for public risk disclosure' principle as of the question's creation date. This suggests that a change in policy would be required. 3. Industry trends: There's growing awareness and concern about AI safety and ethics in the tech industry. This could pressure companies like OpenAI to adopt more transparent and protective policies for whistleblowers and risk disclosures. 4. OpenAI's history: The company has shown some willingness to engage with AI safety concerns in the past, but has also faced criticism for lack of transparency. This mixed history makes it uncertain whether they would make such a commitment. 5. Potential benefits: Adopting this principle could improve OpenAI's public image and relationships with researchers and ethicists, which might incentivize them to make this commitment. 6.

It aims to strengthen global health security and improve pandemic preparedness and response. 4. Global health priorities: The approval of the Pandemic Agreement would likely depend more on global health concerns, geopolitical factors, and the specific terms of the agreement rather than AI governance issues. 5. Indirect influence: While OpenAI's commitment might not directly relate to the Pandemic Agreement, it could symbolize a broader trend towards responsible technology governance, which might indirectly influence some countries' perspectives on global cooperation. 6.

The timeline: The World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2024 precedes the July 1, 2024 deadline for OpenAI's potential commitment. This means the WHA decision will be made before we know if the condition is met. The current status of the Pandemic Agreement: As of now (2023), negotiations for the Pandemic Agreement are ongoing. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to have it ready for consideration at the 77th World Health Assembly in May 2024. Global health priorities: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for better global health coordination, which could increase the likelihood of approving such an agreement. Potential challenges: International agreements often face hurdles due to differing national interests, sovereignty concerns, and complex negotiations. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate to high chance that the Pandemic Agreement will be approved at the May 2024 WHA, regardless of OpenAI's actions. Here's why: The global experience with COVID-19 has created a strong impetus for better pandemic preparedness and response mechanisms. The WHO and many countries have invested significant time and resources into developing this agreement. There's likely to be substantial political pressure to show progress on global health security. However, there are also factors that could prevent approval: Potential disagreements among member states on specific provisions of the agreement. Possible concerns about national sovereignty or economic impacts. The complexity of the agreement might require more time for negotiations.

Election proximity: As we get closer to the election (November 2024), polls tend to become more stable and accurate. Given that Trump is already leading by 2.4 points, it's quite possible that this lead could increase slightly to fall within the 2-4 point range. However, it's also possible that it could remain stable or even decrease slightly.

Semi-final allocation: The countries are not always in the same semi-final, which could affect their chances independently. We don't know which semi-final each country will be in for 2024. 4. Quality of entries: The most crucial factor is the quality of each country's song and performance, which we don't know at this point for 2024. 5. Voting patterns: While there isn't a strong voting alliance between Cyprus and Malta, they do occasionally exchange points. 6. Number of qualifiers: Typically, 10 countries qualify from each semi-final. Malta's chances depend on the strength of the competition in their semi-final. 7. Recent performance: Malta qualified for the final in 2021 but failed to qualify in 2022 and 2023, showing a downward trend. Given that Cyprus has qualified, it suggests that the overall quality of entries might be comparable to recent years. However, Cyprus qualifying doesn't significantly increase Malta's chances, as their fates are largely independent. Malta's recent struggle to qualify (2022 and 2023) is a concern, but they have shown the ability to produce competitive entries in the past. Their qualification will primarily depend on the strength of their own entry and the competition in their semi-final. Considering all these factors, I would estimate that Malta has a slightly less than even chance of qualifying, even if Cyprus does."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "f96ae7d8-8f0c-4d0a-ab69-d2f163033a71", "title": "Given Cyprus fails to qualify for the Grand Final, will Malta qualify for Eurovision 2024 Grand Final?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Cyprus does not participate in a Semi-final or is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as not having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

The 76ers are a strong team, but winning the NBA Finals is extremely difficult. There are 30 teams in the NBA, and only one can win. Historically, the 76ers have won only 3 NBA championships (1955, 1967, 1983), and haven't won in 40 years. While they have star players like Joel Embiid, the competition in the NBA is fierce.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history.

Time frame: The market has from May 30 (creation date) to July 15, which is about 46 days. 3. Market topic: The embedded market is about predicting the number of traders in itself, which creates a self-referential and potentially viral dynamic. 4. Platform dynamics: Manifold Markets is a prediction market platform with an active community, but the growth rate of traders for a specific market can vary widely. 5. Incentives: The self-referential nature of the market creates an incentive for participants to share and promote the market to reach the target. 6. Historical data: Without specific data on typical growth rates for markets on Manifold, it's hard to make a precise estimate. However, gaining 78 traders in 46 days (about 1.7 traders per day) seems achievable for an engaging market. 7. Potential challenges: The market might experience rapid initial growth but could slow down as it approaches the target, as often happens with such challenges. 8. Creator's influence: The market creator mentions having \"extremely loyal followers,\" which could help in promoting the market. Given these factors, I believe there's a good chance the market will reach 377 traders by July 15.

Technological advancements: As technology in sports equipment, training methods, and performance analysis continues to improve, athletes are more likely to break world records. 4. Time since last Olympics: The Paris Olympics will take place three years after Tokyo, instead of the usual four. This shorter gap might mean slightly less time for significant improvements in some sports, potentially reducing the number of world records broken. 5.

The independence of results means that Switzerland's qualification doesn't directly affect Norway's chances, but it could indicate favorable conditions for similar countries.

Strategic importance: Chasiv Yar is considered strategically important due to its elevated position and proximity to other key locations in the Donetsk region. 3. Russian objectives: Russia has shown a continued interest in fully controlling the Donetsk Oblast, which includes Chasiv Yar. 4.

Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in multiple states to remove Trump from the ballot using this argument. The most prominent case is in Colorado, where a lawsuit has been filed to keep Trump off the 2024 ballot. 3.

US Core CPI increase: The Core CPI (Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy) is a key measure of inflation. In recent years, inflation has been a concern, but central banks have been working to bring it under control. By July 2024, it's likely that inflation will have moderated somewhat, but a 0.1% monthly increase is still quite possible. Historical data shows that monthly increases of 0.1% or more are common, even in periods of relatively stable inflation. 2. Nvidia's stock price: As of July 2023, Nvidia's stock price is well above $400 per share. For it to fall below $100 by July 31, 2024, would require a massive decline of over 75%. While stock prices can be volatile, such a dramatic drop for a leading technology company like Nvidia in a relatively short period is quite rare, barring exceptional circumstances. Factors to consider: a) Nvidia is a leader in AI and graphics processing technology, with strong market position and growth prospects. b) The company has shown resilience even during economic downturns. c) A Core CPI increase above 0.1% might lead to some market volatility, but it's unlikely to cause such a drastic drop in Nvidia's stock price alone. d) For Nvidia's stock to fall so dramatically, there would likely need to be a combination of factors such as a severe economic recession, company-specific problems, or a broader tech industry collapse. Given these considerations, while it's possible for the Core CPI to increase by more than 0.1% in July 2024, the probability of Nvidia's stock price falling below $100 by July 31, 2024, even under this condition, is extremely low.

Conditional nature of the question: The scenario is predicated on Core CPI increasing by 0.1% or less in July 2024, which would indicate very low inflation. 4. Nvidia's business and market position: Nvidia is a leader in GPU technology and has been benefiting greatly from the AI boom. Their business fundamentals are strong. 5.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Nvidia would close below $100 per share by July 31, 2024, even with the condition of low Core CPI increase: 1.

The difference in Trump's performance against Biden vs. a generic Democrat in Manifold polls. 2. The likelihood of Donald Trump Jr. becoming the Republican nominee for 2024. For the first part, we're assuming it's true that Trump gains less than 3% when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat. This condition is met, so we can focus on the second part. Regarding Donald Trump Jr. becoming the Republican nominee for 2024: 1. Current frontrunner status: As of now (2023), Donald Trump Sr. is the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination, not Donald Trump Jr. Other candidates like Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are also polling higher than Trump Jr. 2. Political experience: Donald Trump Jr. has never held elected office, which is typically a significant disadvantage for presidential candidates. Most nominees have experience as governors, senators, or high-ranking government officials. 3. Name recognition: While Trump Jr. benefits from his father's fame, he doesn't have the same level of personal brand recognition or political following. 4. Party dynamics: The Republican Party is likely to prefer candidates with more experience and broader appeal, especially given the controversies surrounding the Trump family. 5. Trump Sr.'s influence: If Donald Trump Sr. remains in the race, it's highly unlikely he would step aside for his son. If he drops out, he would more likely endorse an established politician than his son. 6. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still over a year away (as of 2023), and a lot can change in politics. However, for Trump Jr. to become the nominee, there would need to be a dramatic shift in current political dynamics. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that Donald Trump Jr. will be the Republican nominee for 2024.

Given these factors, while there is ongoing tension between the Philippines and China, the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring in the short time frame before June 1, 2024, seems relatively low.

Historical context: The Philippines and China have had ongoing tensions, particularly regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

If one country takes such action, it's common for the other to respond in kind. 3. Short timeframe: The question asks about a second incident occurring within a two-month window (June 1 to August 1, 2024). This is a relatively short period, which could work both ways - it might not allow enough time for tensions to cool, or it might not be enough time for another significant incident to occur. 4. Trigger event: The question is conditional on an initial expulsion or recall happening before June 1, 2024. This initial event would likely create a tense atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of further diplomatic actions. 5. Ongoing issues: The South China Sea dispute is a long-standing issue that is unlikely to be resolved quickly. This ongoing tension provides a backdrop for potential further incidents. 6. International pressure: The international community often tries to de-escalate such situations, which might reduce the likelihood of repeated incidents. 7. Domestic politics: Both countries might face internal pressure to appear strong in the face of perceived aggression, which could encourage further action. Considering these factors, I believe there is a moderately high chance of a second diplomatic expulsion or recall occurring within the given timeframe. The initial incident would create a tense atmosphere, and the ongoing territorial disputes provide ample opportunity for further disagreements. The short timeframe might not allow for full de-escalation, and there could be pressure for retaliation or further action from domestic audiences. However, the severity of diplomatic expulsions or recalls might also encourage both sides to exercise caution to prevent further escalation. International pressure could also play a role in preventing immediate follow-up actions.

Joe Biden's current status: As of now (July 2023), Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. 2. The conditional scenario: The question assumes there will be no Democratic party presidential debates. This could indicate a lack of serious challengers or a party decision to rally behind Biden. 3. Biden's age and health: Biden will be 81 at the start of a potential second term, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. Health concerns could potentially influence his decision. 4. Political landscape: The absence of debates might suggest strong party unity behind Biden, which would make it less likely for him to step aside. 5. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to decide not to seek re-election, especially this late in the process. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (usually held in August). Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he won't accept the nomination: 1. He has already announced his intention to run. 2. The lack of debates suggests party unity behind him. 3. While age is a concern, it hasn't stopped him from running so far. 4. It would be unprecedented and potentially damaging to the party to withdraw so late in the process. 5. The timeframe is very close to the convention, making a last-minute change even more unlikely.

While this shows he has some support within the party, he was ultimately unable to secure the nomination. 3. Current polling: Recent polls for the 2024 Republican primary consistently show Cruz polling in the low single digits, far behind Trump, DeSantis, and even other candidates like Nikki Haley and Mike Pence. 4. Fundraising and support: Cruz has not shown significant fundraising prowess or garnered major endorsements for a 2024 run, which are crucial for a successful campaign. 5. Public perception: Cruz's reputation was damaged among some Republicans due to his initial refusal to endorse Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention, and later for his perceived role in the January 6th events. 6.

The exact lead varies by poll and aggregator. 2. Historical precedent: Polling averages tend to fluctuate over time, especially as we get closer to the election. A year out from the election, polls are not highly predictive of the final outcome. 3. Potential events: Many things can happen between now and July 2024 that could significantly impact polling numbers, such as economic changes, international events, scandals, or major policy decisions. 4. Specific range: The question asks about a very narrow range (greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points lead for Trump). This is a precise window that requires a specific set of circumstances to occur. 5. 538's methodology: 538 is known for its robust polling aggregation and weighting system, which tends to smooth out outliers and rapid fluctuations. 6. Polarization: The US electorate is highly polarized, which could lead to relatively stable polling numbers with less dramatic swings. 7. Incumbent factor: While Biden is the incumbent, which typically provides an advantage, his approval ratings have been relatively low, which could offset this advantage. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Trump would have a lead in this specific range.

The timing: This is very close to the Republican National Convention, which typically occurs in July or August of the election year. 3. Ted Cruz's position in the Republican Party and his relationship with Trump. 4. Historical precedents for changing nominees late in the process. First, the fact that Trump has a lead over Biden so close to the election suggests that he would be a strong candidate for the Republicans. This makes it less likely that the party would want to switch candidates at the last minute. Second, by July 15, 2024, the primary process would be long over, and Trump would likely have secured the necessary delegates to be the nominee. Changing the nominee at this late stage would be extremely unusual and disruptive. Third, while Ted Cruz has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party, he has had a complicated relationship with Trump. They were rivals in the 2016 primary, and while Cruz has sometimes supported Trump, he's also been critical at times. It's unlikely that Trump would willingly step aside for Cruz. Fourth, there is very little historical precedent for a major party changing its nominee so close to the election, especially when the presumptive nominee is polling well. The last time anything similar happened was in 1972 when the Democratic vice-presidential nominee was replaced, but the presidential nominee remained the same.

Conditional scenario: The question is based on a specific polling condition in July 2024. This suggests that something significant might happen between now and then that could affect Trump's candidacy. 3. Republican Party dynamics: For Ted Cruz to become the nominee, there would need to be a major shift in the party's support away from Trump.

Joe Biden's current health status: As of the creation date of this question (July 14, 2024), there have been no reports of Joe Biden facing any severe health issues that would suggest an imminent threat to his life. While he is the oldest serving U.S. president at 81 years old, he has maintained an active schedule and has not shown signs of critical health problems. 3. Time frame: The question asks about Biden's potential death before Saturday, July 26th, which is less than two weeks from the question's creation date. The probability of a sudden, unexpected death for any individual in such a short time frame is generally very low, barring any known severe health issues or external threats. 4. Secret Service protection: The Secret Service is responsible for protecting the President. Even if the head of the Secret Service resigns, the organization would continue to function and protect the President. A change in leadership does not typically result in an immediate degradation of protection quality. 5. Correlation between events: There is no inherent causal link between the resignation of the Secret Service director and the President's health or safety.

Given these factors, the probability of Joe Biden dying before Saturday, July 26th, even assuming the resignation of the Secret Service director, is extremely low.

While he has had some health concerns in the past, there have been no recent reports of severe health issues that would suggest an imminent risk of death. 3. Presidential protection: The Secret Service is responsible for protecting the President. Their primary mission is to ensure the President's safety, which makes a sudden death less likely. 4. Short time frame: The question asks about Biden's potential death within a very short time frame (less than two weeks from the question's creation date to the resolution date). The probability of any specific individual dying within such a short period is generally very low, barring known severe health issues or external threats. 5. Official announcement: Even if an unexpected health emergency were to occur, there might be a delay between the actual event and an official announcement, potentially pushing it past the specified deadline. 6.

Timeline: The arrest warrants need to be issued before July 1, 2024, which is before the potential terrorist attack would occur. Given these factors, we need to consider: a) The likelihood of the ICC issuing arrest warrants for these Israeli leaders, independent of the terrorist attack condition. b) The current political climate and ongoing investigations into Israeli actions. c) The timeline of ICC investigations and warrant issuances. As of February 2024, the ICC has been investigating alleged war crimes in Palestinian territories. There have been calls for investigations into Israeli actions in Gaza, particularly following the October 2023 conflict. However, ICC investigations and subsequent actions typically take a considerable amount of time. The ICC operates independently of specific events like terrorist attacks, so the conditional nature of the question doesn't directly affect the likelihood of arrest warrants being issued. The warrants would need to be issued based on evidence and investigations that are already underway or concluded by July 1, 2024. Given the current political climate and the ongoing investigations, there is a possibility that the ICC might issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. However, several factors make this unlikely by July 1, 2024: 1. The ICC's investigative process is typically slow and thorough. 2.

For this to happen, there would need to be a significant shift in Republican party dynamics. 2. Trump's lead over Biden: In this scenario, Trump is not the Republican nominee, yet we're asked about his lead. This implies that Trump would be running as an independent or third-party candidate. 3. Specific polling margin: The question asks for a very narrow range (between 3 and 4 points) in Trump's lead. Given these factors: a) If Christie were to become the nominee, it would likely be due to a major upheaval in the Republican party, which could significantly change the political landscape. b) Trump running as a third-party candidate would split the Republican vote, potentially benefiting Biden. c) Christie as the official Republican nominee might attract some traditional Republican voters who are wary of Trump, further complicating the polling. d) The specific time frame (July 15, 2024) is relatively close to the election, where polls tend to be more volatile. e) The narrow range specified (3-4 point lead) makes this even less likely, as polls often have margins of error larger than this range. f) Historical precedent suggests that third-party candidates typically poll worse as the election approaches, which could work against Trump in this scenario.

Name recognition: While Christie has national name recognition from his time as New Jersey Governor and his 2016 run, he has been less prominent in national politics recently compared to other potential candidates. 5. Fundraising ability: Christie would need to demonstrate strong fundraising capabilities to compete with well-funded candidates like Trump and DeSantis. There's currently no indication that he has this level of financial support. 6. Party dynamics: The Republican Party has shifted significantly since Christie's last run, becoming more aligned with Trump's policies and rhetoric. Christie's more moderate positioning may not resonate with the current party base. 7.

Let's break it down: 1. European Parliament Elections: The Greens\u2013EFA not holding the most seats after the 2024 European Parliament elections is highly likely. Historically, they have never been the largest group in the European Parliament. The European People's Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) have traditionally been the largest groups. It's improbable that the Greens\u2013EFA would suddenly become the largest group, so we can assume this condition will be met. 2. US Presidential Election Polling: Predicting polling numbers for a specific date (July 15, 2024) more than a year in advance is challenging. However, we can consider some factors: a) Historical trends: In recent elections, polls have often underestimated Republican support. b) Current political climate: As of 2023, there's significant dissatisfaction with the Biden administration, particularly regarding the economy and inflation. c) Trump's legal issues: Ongoing investigations and potential indictments could affect his popularity, but they might also galvanize his base. d) Election cycle timing: July 15, 2024, is about 3.5 months before the election. At this point, both parties will have likely chosen their nominees, and campaigning will be in full swing. e) Polling volatility: A lead between 2 and 3 points is relatively narrow and could easily fluctuate. Given these factors, it's plausible that Trump could have a lead over Biden, but the specific range of 2-3 points is a narrow window. Trump having any lead is more likely than not, but the exact margin is hard to predict. The combination of these two events (Greens\u2013EFA not holding the most seats AND Trump leading by 2-3 points) reduces the overall probability.

A sudden reversal would be surprising and likely indicate a significant change in circumstances. 2. The relationship between not seeking re-election and incapacitation: Deciding not to run for re-election does not necessarily imply incapacitation. Presidents have chosen not to seek second terms for various reasons, including political calculations or personal preferences. 3. The high bar for invoking the 25th Amendment: Invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment is an extremely serious action, typically reserved for situations where the President is clearly unable to perform their duties due to severe physical or mental incapacitation.

Current situation: As of June 2023, the Prime Minister of France is \u00c9lisabeth Borne, who belongs to the Renaissance party, which is part of the Together (Ensemble) coalition. 2. Political stability: France has a history of relatively frequent changes in Prime Ministers, especially when the President faces challenges or seeks to change political direction. 3. Time frame: The question asks about the situation on July 30, 2024, which is more than a year away from the current date. 4. Presidential term: Emmanuel Macron's second term as President will still be ongoing in July 2024, and he has historically favored Prime Ministers from his own political alliance. 5. Electoral schedule: There are no scheduled national elections between now and July 2024 that would directly impact the Prime Minister's position. 6. Coalition strength: The Together coalition, while facing challenges, remains the primary support base for President Macron. Given these factors, it seems likely that the Prime Minister on July 30, 2024, will still belong to the Together coalition. The main reasons for this are: a) Macron's presidency continues until 2027, and he's likely to maintain support from his coalition. b) There are no scheduled events that would necessarily lead to a change in the coalition of the Prime Minister. c) Even if there's a change in the individual serving as Prime Minister, it's probable that the replacement would come from the same coalition to maintain policy continuity. However, we must also consider potential risks: a) Unexpected political crises or scandals could force a change. b) Macron might decide to appoint a Prime Minister from outside the coalition to broaden his support base, though this is less likely.

Nate Silver's model: Silver is known for his data-driven approach to political forecasting. His models typically incorporate polling data, economic indicators, and historical trends. 4. The specific threshold: The question states that Harris's odds need to exceed 46.6% in Silver's model for a YES resolution. 5. Time frame: The scenario gives about three weeks between Biden's potential announcement (by July 15) and the measurement date (August 9). Given these factors: a) If Biden were to withdraw, Harris would likely see an immediate boost in her chances. As VP, she has high name recognition and would be seen as a natural successor. b) However, her current approval ratings are not particularly high, which could limit her potential in Silver's model. c) The three-week timeframe would allow for some polling to be conducted, which would influence Silver's model. This period might not be long enough for a full reassessment of the race. d) Other potential Democratic candidates might emerge, potentially splitting the field and affecting Harris's odds. e) The 46.6% threshold is relatively high, considering it's for winning the general election, not just the Democratic nomination. f) Silver's models tend to be conservative and slow to react to sudden changes, preferring to wait for more data. Given these considerations, I believe there's a moderate chance that Harris's odds would exceed 46.6% in Silver's model under this scenario. The sudden withdrawal of an incumbent president would be a major shock to the political system, and Harris would be well-positioned to benefit initially. However, the high threshold and the relatively short timeframe make it far from certain."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "630d9fcc-4ebf-43b4-b3f8-4b53f471600b", "title": "Given Joe Biden does not announce he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination, will Kamala's odds of winning increase according to Nate Silver's model?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Joe Biden does not make a definitive, public, official announcement before 00:00 Eastern on July 15, 2024, that he will not seek and will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2024 cycle.

Larry Elder, while known in conservative circles, is not a frontrunner for the Republican nomination. The likelihood of him becoming the nominee over more prominent figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, or others is very low. 2. Trump's lead over Biden Even if Larry Elder were to become the nominee, we're asked about Trump's lead over Biden. This implies that Trump would still be running, likely as an independent or third-party candidate. This scenario would likely split the Republican vote, significantly reducing the chances of a substantial Trump lead over Biden. 3. Specific polling margin We're looking for a very narrow range of outcomes: Trump leading Biden by more than 3 but not more than 4 points. This is an extremely specific range, which further reduces the probability. 4. Timing The poll we're interested in is for July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the election. By this time, campaigning would be in full swing, and polls would be more volatile. 5. 538's national polling average 538 is known for its rigorous polling methodology, which tends to be more accurate than individual polls. However, even their averages can have some margin of error. Given these factors, the probability of this specific scenario occurring is extremely low.

While not impossible, it requires a specific set of circumstances to fall within this exact range.

The specific lead we're looking for is between 2 and 3 percentage points. 4. The date in question is July 15, 2024, well after the typical time for primaries and conventions. Several factors make this scenario highly unlikely: 1. If Tim Scott is the Republican nominee, it would be unusual for polls to still be measuring Trump's performance against Biden. Typically, polls would focus on the actual nominees (Scott vs. Biden in this case). 2. For Trump to have a lead over Biden when he's not the nominee suggests a highly unusual political situation. It could imply that Trump is running as an independent or that there's significant confusion among voters. 3. The specific range of 2-3 percentage points is quite narrow, making it even less likely to occur. 4. By July 2024, the general election campaign would be in full swing, and voters would likely be more focused on the actual nominees rather than Trump if he's not the candidate. 5. The scenario where Tim Scott becomes the nominee over Trump is itself quite unlikely, given Trump's current strong position in the Republican party. However, there are a few factors that could slightly increase the probability: 1. Trump has maintained a strong base of support within the Republican party, which could potentially translate to continued polling even if he's not the nominee. 2. If Trump were to run as an independent or third-party candidate, polls might continue to measure his performance against Biden. 3. The political landscape in 2024 could be highly unconventional, potentially leading to unusual polling scenarios.

Trump's popularity among Republicans: Despite legal challenges and controversies, Trump maintains a strong base of support within the Republican Party. 3. The hypothetical scenario: The question posits a scenario where Trump gains at least 3% more support when facing Joe Biden compared to a generic Democrat. This suggests that Trump would be seen as a stronger candidate against Biden specifically, which could further solidify his position as the preferred Republican nominee. 4. Other Trump family members: While Donald Trump is the most likely Trump family member to be the nominee, the question allows for other family members to fulfill the condition. However, none of the other Trump family members have shown significant political ambitions or support for a presidential run at this time. 5. Potential challenges: There are ongoing legal issues and investigations involving Donald Trump that could potentially impact his ability to run or his popularity. However, these have not significantly diminished his support among Republicans so far. 6. Time until the nomination: The Republican nominee will be officially selected in 2024, leaving some time for potential changes in the political landscape. Given these factors, especially the hypothetical scenario where Trump gains additional support against Biden, it seems highly likely that a Trump family member (most likely Donald Trump himself) would be the Republican nominee.

However, we are asked to assume this scenario occurs for the purpose of answering the main question. 2. Current political landscape: As of now (2023), Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential election. He has a significant lead over other potential candidates in most polls. 3. Trump family influence: The Trump family has maintained a strong presence in Republican politics since Donald Trump's presidency. However, other than Donald Trump himself, no other family member has shown serious intent to run for president. 4. Republican party dynamics: While the Trump brand remains strong among a significant portion of Republican voters, there's also a growing desire among some party members for new leadership. 5. Legal challenges: Donald Trump is facing several legal challenges, which could potentially impact his ability to run or his appeal to voters. 6.

This could be interpreted as a sign of Trump's continued strength within the Republican party, even if he might face challenges in a general election. While there are potential obstacles (legal issues, party fatigue with Trump), his current lead in polls and the strong support he maintains among a significant portion of Republican voters make him the most likely nominee at this point.

More prominent candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others are leading in polls and media attention. 2.

While he has some appeal as a young, Hispanic conservative, his name recognition is limited outside of Florida. 3.

Historical performance: Both Iceland and Albania have participated in Eurovision for many years. Iceland has qualified for the final 11 times out of 16 attempts since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004. Albania has qualified 10 times out of 19 attempts in the same period. This suggests that both countries have a reasonable chance of qualifying, with Iceland having a slightly better track record. 2. Recent performance: In Eurovision 2023, Iceland qualified for the final, while Albania did not. This might indicate that Iceland currently has a stronger position, but it's important to note that Eurovision results can vary significantly from year to year. 3. Conditional probability: The question is conditional on Iceland qualifying, which means we're already assuming a scenario where Iceland performs well enough to reach the final. This could suggest a generally favorable voting climate for smaller or less prominent countries, which might benefit Albania. 4. Semi-final allocation: The allocation of countries to different semi-finals can significantly impact their chances of qualification. Without knowing which semi-final each country is in, it's difficult to assess their relative chances accurately. 5. Song quality and performance: The quality of the song and the stage performance are crucial factors in Eurovision success. Without knowing the details of the 2024 entries, we can't make a definitive judgment. 6. Voting blocs: While not officially recognized, voting patterns in Eurovision often show regional or cultural affiliations. Iceland and Albania don't typically belong to the same voting blocs, so Iceland's success doesn't necessarily indicate a higher chance for Albania. 7. Number of qualifiers: Typically, 10 countries qualify from each semi-final. This means that if there are two semi-finals, 20 out of approximately 35-40 countries in the semi-finals will qualify, giving each country a reasonable chance. Given these factors, I believe Albania has a fair chance of qualifying if Iceland does, but it's far from certain.

Historical volatility: Presidential polling averages tend to fluctuate, but major shifts usually occur over longer periods unless there are significant events. 4. Proximity to the election: July 15, 2024, is close to the 2024 presidential election (typically held in early November).

The conditional nature of the question: We're only considering scenarios where Trump's lead is either \u22642 points or >4 points on July 15, 2024. This excludes the scenario where Trump leads by 2-4 points. 2. The short time frame: We're looking at a change over just 4 days (July 15 to July 19). In general, polling averages and forecasts don't tend to shift dramatically over such a short period unless there's a major event. 3. FiveThirtyEight's methodology: Their forecasts consider more than just polling averages. They include economic indicators, historical trends, and other factors. 4. The polarized nature of the current political climate: This tends to make large swings less likely. Let's consider the two possible scenarios: Scenario 1: Trump's lead is \u22642 points on July 15 In this case, the race is very close. Given the short timeframe and FiveThirtyEight's comprehensive model, it's quite likely that Biden would be projected as the favorite on July 19, especially if he's within 2 points or even leading. Scenario 2: Trump's lead is >4 points on July 15 This is a significant lead in a presidential race. It would be unlikely for Biden to become the favorite in just 4 days unless there was a major event that dramatically shifted public opinion. The question resolves to 'Yes' only if Biden has a higher probability on July 19. Given that one scenario strongly favors a 'Yes' resolution and the other strongly favors a 'No' resolution, and we have no information about which scenario is more likely, we might be tempted to say it's a 50-50 chance. However, I believe there's a slight edge for a 'Yes' resolution for two reasons: 1. The incumbent advantage: Biden is the incumbent, which historically provides a small boost in elections. 2. FiveThirtyEight's model complexity: Their model considers factors beyond just polling, which could give Biden an edge even if he's slightly behind in polls. These factors make me think that in the \u22642 point scenario, Biden is very likely to be favored, while in the >4 point scenario, there's still a small chance he could be favored due to other factors in the model."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.008698081890257447, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.002174520472564362, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.17907200706655454, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Even if Luxembourg were to participate, their lack of recent experience in the contest and the absence of established voting blocs supporting them would make qualification challenging. Slovenia's non-qualification doesn't significantly affect Luxembourg's chances.

Trump's history of legal strategies: Historically, Trump has been reluctant to testify in legal proceedings, often citing executive privilege or attempting to delay or avoid testimony.

This might make Trump more cautious about testifying, as any statements could be used against him in criminal proceedings. 3. Legal advice: Trump's lawyers are likely to advise against testifying, as it could expose him to potential perjury charges or provide prosecutors with damaging statements. 4. Trump's personality: Despite legal advice, Trump has a history of being outspoken and believing in his ability to persuade others. This could potentially increase the chances of him deciding to testify. 5. Trial strategy: If Trump's legal team believes that his testimony could sway the jury or public opinion in his favor, they might consider allowing him to testify. 6. Timing: The trial is scheduled for March 25, 2024, which is before the resolution date of this question. This gives ample time for the trial to proceed and for Trump to potentially testify. 7. Political considerations: As the trial will occur during an election year, Trump might see testifying as an opportunity to rally his base or present his side of the story to the public. 8. The condition of no Iranian military response: This condition doesn't directly affect the likelihood of Trump testifying, but it does ensure that external geopolitical events won't interfere with the trial proceeding as scheduled. Weighing these factors, I believe it's more likely that Trump will not testify. The legal risks and potential for self-incrimination outweigh the potential benefits of testifying. His lawyers are likely to strongly advise against it, and historically, Trump has often followed legal advice in high-stakes situations despite his public bravado.

A public call from 10 or more senators for Biden to drop out would be seen as extremely divisive and potentially damaging to the party's chances in the general election. 5.

Johnson decided not to seek re-election due to the Vietnam War. 6. Potential alternatives: While there are other prominent Democrats (e.g., Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg), none have positioned themselves as clear alternatives to Biden or shown any indication of challenging him. 7. Biden's performance and approval ratings: While Biden's approval ratings have fluctuated, they haven't reached a level that would typically prompt such a drastic action from his party.

The Republicans would still choose their nominee based on their primary elections and caucuses. 4.

These candidates have higher national recognition and stronger support bases. 3. Polling: Current national polls show Suarez with very low support, often not even registering above 1%. This indicates a significant uphill battle for him to gain traction. 4. Fundraising: As a relatively new entrant, Suarez's fundraising capabilities are likely to be limited compared to established candidates who have been preparing for longer. 5. Experience: While Suarez has executive experience as a mayor, he lacks national political experience, which could be seen as a disadvantage in a presidential race. 6.

Song quality and performer: As of now, we don't know what song Czechia will send or who will perform it. This is a significant unknown factor that could greatly influence their chances. 4. Competition level: The overall quality of entries from other countries can affect Czechia's chances, but this is also unknown at this point. 5. Voting patterns: Czechia doesn't have strong voting blocs or consistent allies in Eurovision, which can be a disadvantage. 6. Semi-final allocation: The distribution of countries in each semi-final can impact qualification chances, but this information is not available yet. 7. Commitment to the contest: Czechia has shown continued interest in Eurovision, suggesting they will likely put effort into their entry. Given these factors, Czechia's chances of qualifying are somewhat uncertain. Their historical qualification rate of 40% provides a baseline, but their improved performance in recent years (before 2023) suggests they might have a slightly better chance than their overall history indicates. Without knowing the specifics of their 2024 entry or the competition they'll face, it's difficult to be more precise. However, considering their recent performances and continued commitment to the contest, I would estimate their chances as slightly better than their historical average, but still below 50% due to the competitive nature of Eurovision and their lack of consistent voting allies."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "bd6906b5-dd2f-4759-8f82-80d3fb50abf7", "title": "Will San Marino qualify for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if San Marino participates in a Semi-final and is officially announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as having qualified for the Eurovision 2024 Grand Final.

This could slightly increase the chances for Czechia as well. Given that Czechia has a better historical record of qualification than San Marino, if San Marino manages to qualify, it might suggest a favorable year for countries that traditionally struggle to qualify.

The conditional nature of the question: The main question only applies if the linked market gets fewer than 377 traders by the end of July 15, 2023. Without access to the linked market, we can't be certain about this condition. However, given that this is a specific condition, we should assume it's met for the purpose of our analysis. 2. Meta's track record on AI transparency: Meta (formerly Facebook) has shown some commitment to AI transparency in the past. They've published research papers and some information about their AI models, but they haven't always been at the forefront of external auditing or red-teaming. 3. Increasing pressure for AI safety: There's growing public and regulatory pressure on big tech companies to ensure AI safety and transparency. This could motivate Meta to conduct and publish external red-teaming results. 4. Timeframe: The question gives almost a full year (until June 30, 2024) for Meta to publish such a report. This is a reasonable amount of time to conduct external red-teaming and prepare a report. 5. Meta's AI development: Meta is actively developing AI models, including large language models. As they continue to advance their AI capabilities, they may see increasing value in external safety assessments. 6. Competition and industry trends: Other major AI companies like Google and OpenAI have published some information about their safety practices. Meta might feel pressure to keep up with industry standards. 7. Potential drawbacks: Publishing external red-teaming results could expose vulnerabilities or limitations in Meta's AI models, which might make them hesitant. Considering these factors, I believe there's a moderate to good chance that Meta will publish such a report by the given deadline. The growing importance of AI safety, the relatively long timeframe, and industry trends all point towards this being likely.

EU-China relations and the impact of new tariffs: The announcement of new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles by the EU could have mixed effects. On one hand, it might be seen as protecting European industries, which could appeal to nationalist sentiments. On the other hand, it could potentially lead to economic repercussions if China retaliates, which might affect Hungary's economy. 3. Fidesz-KDNP's stance on EU policies: Fidesz-KDNP has often been at odds with EU policies, positioning itself as a defender of Hungarian interests against Brussels. New tariffs on Chinese products might be used by Fidesz-KDNP to reinforce this narrative, potentially strengthening their support. 4. Hungary's economic ties with China: Hungary has been cultivating closer economic ties with China as part of its \"Eastern Opening\" policy. New tariffs might be seen as detrimental to this strategy, which could potentially be used by opposition parties to criticize Fidesz-KDNP. 5. Timing of the announcement: The tariff announcement would come very close to the European Parliament elections, leaving little time for it to significantly impact voter preferences. 6. Fidesz-KDNP's current popularity: Despite controversies and criticism from the EU, Fidesz-KDNP has maintained strong support domestically, largely due to its populist policies and control over much of the media landscape. 7.

Competition: The level of competition in Eurovision has been increasing, with more countries taking the contest seriously and sending high-quality entries. 5. Semi-final draw: The semi-final allocation draw has not taken place yet, so we don't know which countries Denmark will compete against in their semi-final. 6.

Conditional probability: The question assumes Denmark has already qualified, which might indicate a strong year for Nordic countries or a general shift in voting patterns that could benefit Poland as well. 4.

Song quality and performance: Without knowing the specific songs and performers for 2024, it's difficult to assess their chances accurately. 6. Voting blocs: While not as strong as some other countries, Poland can sometimes benefit from diaspora voting and regional support. Given that Denmark has qualified (which is not guaranteed based on recent performance), it suggests that the overall quality of entries might be high, or that there's a favorable voting pattern for countries in that region.

Current political landscape: As of June 2023, the Republican field for the 2024 nomination is already crowded with high-profile candidates like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others. Will Hurd, while having announced his candidacy, is not considered a frontrunner. 2. Will Hurd's profile: Hurd is a former CIA officer and congressman from Texas. He's known for being a moderate Republican who has been critical of Donald Trump. This stance might appeal to some voters but could be a significant disadvantage in a party where Trump still holds considerable influence. 3. Polling data: Current polls do not show Will Hurd as a leading contender for the Republican nomination. He consistently polls in the low single digits, far behind frontrunners like Trump and DeSantis. 4. Fundraising and resources: As a relatively lesser-known candidate, Hurd may struggle to raise the funds necessary to compete with better-established candidates in a long primary campaign. 5. Party dynamics: The Republican Party has been trending towards more conservative positions in recent years, which may not align well with Hurd's more moderate stance. 6. Historical precedent: It's rare for a candidate polling so low at this stage to surge and win the nomination, especially in a crowded field with well-known alternatives. 7. Time until convention: While there is still time for dynamics to change before the Republican National Convention in 2024, it would require a significant shift in the political landscape for Hurd to become the frontrunner. 8. The condition about Biden: The stipulation about Joe Biden not announcing he won't seek re-election doesn't significantly impact the Republican nomination process, so it doesn't materially affect Hurd's chances. Given these factors, it appears highly unlikely that Will Hurd will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

This is within the range we're considering, but there's still over a month for this to change. 3. Political landscape: The period between June and mid-July could see significant events that might shift public opinion, such as debates, policy announcements, or unforeseen controversies. 4. Economic factors: The state of the economy often plays a crucial role in presidential approval ratings and voting intentions. Any major economic news could sway the polls. 5. International events: Global issues or foreign policy crises could impact how voters view the candidates' leadership capabilities. 6. Campaign strategies: Both campaigns will be in full swing, and their effectiveness could influence polling numbers. 7. Margin of error: Polls typically have a margin of error, which means small fluctuations within a few points are common and not always indicative of real changes in public opinion. Given that Trump already leads by 2.4 points as of early June, it's plausible that this lead could persist within the 2-3 point range. However, there's also a significant chance that it could move outside this narrow band in either direction due to the factors mentioned above.

Growth trajectory: Nvidia has been experiencing rapid growth, especially due to the AI boom. Its stock price has more than doubled in 2023 alone. Apple, while still growing, has a more stable and mature growth rate. 3. AI and technology trends: Nvidia is at the forefront of AI chip manufacturing, which is a rapidly growing sector.

Unexpected events or market corrections could significantly impact either company's valuation. 5. Apple's diversification: Apple has a more diversified product line and revenue stream, which could provide more stability but might limit explosive growth compared to Nvidia. 6.

Global economic factors: Economic conditions, interest rates, and geopolitical events could impact both companies differently. Given these factors, while Nvidia has shown impressive growth and is well-positioned in the booming AI sector, overtaking Apple's market cap in just one year seems like a tall order. The gap between their market caps is still very large, and Apple's strong market position and diversified portfolio provide a significant buffer.

Nvidia vs. Apple market cap: As of June 2023, Apple's market cap is significantly larger than Nvidia's (Apple ~$2.8 trillion, Nvidia ~$1 trillion). For Nvidia to surpass Apple by June 2024, it would require extraordinary growth or a significant decline in Apple's value. While Nvidia has been growing rapidly due to AI advancements, overtaking Apple within a year seems unlikely but not impossible. 2. Trump's lead over Biden: As of June 2023, most polls show a close race between Trump and Biden, with neither having a consistent lead of 2-3 points. Political landscapes can change rapidly, but a lead of this specific magnitude for Trump is a relatively narrow range. Combining these factors: - The Nvidia market cap condition is unlikely but possible. - The specific Trump lead condition is also relatively unlikely, given the narrow range and the volatility of political polling.

The last major Magic Kingdom ride announcement at D23 was TRON Lightcycle Run in 2017. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of Disney announcing a new Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024.

This indicates a strong performance and high audience interest in the film, which could potentially influence the overall mood in the film industry. 2. The relationship between box office success and critical reception: While there's often a correlation between box office success and critical reception, it's not always the case. Many blockbusters perform well at the box office but receive mixed or poor reviews from critics. 3. The nature of 'Twisters' (2024): 'Twisters' is a sequel to the 1996 film 'Twister.' The original film was a commercial success but received mixed reviews from critics, with a 57% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Sequels often struggle to match the quality of their predecessors, especially when there's a significant time gap. 4. Current trends in disaster movie reception: Disaster movies often prioritize spectacle over critical acclaim. Recent disaster films have had mixed receptions from critics. For example, 'Moonfall' (2022) has a 36% on Rotten Tomatoes, while 'Greenland' (2020) has a 78%. 5. The 75% threshold: A 75% score on Rotten Tomatoes is quite high and would qualify the film as 'Certified Fresh.'

However, there's always a chance that 'Twisters' could surprise critics with its quality, innovative approach, or timely themes related to climate change.

This short timeframe might not allow for significant shifts in opinion or for users to fully engage with the polls. 5. 3% threshold: The question asks if Trump will gain at least 3% when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat. This is a significant margin, especially considering the short timeframe. 6. Current political climate: As of July 2023, Biden faces some challenges in public perception, including concerns about his age and handling of various issues.

Comparison of Trump vs. Biden and Trump vs. Generic Democrat: Generally, incumbent presidents tend to perform better than generic party candidates because they are known quantities. A generic Democrat might actually perform better than Biden in polls, as voters can project their ideal candidate onto this unnamed figure. 4.

Time frame: The question covers a relatively short period (about 2.5 weeks from the creation date to the resolution date), which limits the window for such an attack to occur. 4. Escalation risks: A direct, deadly attack by Israel within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation and could potentially lead to a wider regional conflict. This risk might make Israel hesitant to carry out such an operation. 5. International pressure: The ongoing conflict in Gaza has already put Israel under international scrutiny. A direct attack on Iran might further isolate Israel diplomatically. 6. Iranian defenses: Iran has been improving its air defenses and cyber capabilities, which could make it more challenging for Israel to carry out a successful attack. 7. Alternative strategies: Israel might prefer to continue its strategy of covert operations, cyber attacks, or targeted assassinations outside of Iran's borders, which are less likely to result in multiple casualties within Iran. 8. Recent events: The April 13, 2024 Iranian attack on Israel using drones and missiles has significantly increased tensions between the two countries, making some form of Israeli retaliation more likely. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024. The recent Iranian attack on Israel has dramatically increased the likelihood of retaliation, but the short time frame and the potential for wider escalation may still give Israel pause. Israel might opt for a more limited response or one that doesn't meet the specific criteria of the question (e.g., an attack outside Iran's borders or one with fewer casualties)."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "9738e523-976c-4810-9e72-af67330a4d22", "title": "Given Israel carries out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, will Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Israel carries out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024.

Time factor: The hypothetical attack would occur before May 1, 2024, while the polling average is measured on July 15, 2024. This gives over two months for public opinion to shift and stabilize. 5. Specific polling range: The question asks about a very narrow range (Trump leading by >2 and \u22643 points). Given these factors: 1. An Israeli attack on Iran would likely dominate news cycles and could shift focus away from domestic issues where Trump may have an advantage. 2. Biden, as the incumbent, might initially benefit from a rally-around-the-flag effect, potentially narrowing Trump's lead. 3. However, if the situation in the Middle East deteriorates or if Biden's handling of the crisis is perceived negatively, it could benefit Trump in the longer term. 4. The time gap between the event and the polling date allows for multiple developments and shifts in public opinion. 5. The narrow range specified (>2 and \u22643 point lead) makes this a precise prediction, reducing the likelihood of it being exactly in this range. 6. Trump's current lead and the potential for international events to solidify support for him among his base suggest that a lead in this range is plausible, but not highly probable.

Impact of Israel-Iran relations: The question assumes Israel does not carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024.

Haley's background: She has experience as a former governor of South Carolina and as UN Ambassador under Trump, which gives her some credibility and name recognition. 4. Party dynamics: The Republican Party is still heavily influenced by Trump and his supporters. Haley has tried to position herself as both a Trump ally and a fresh alternative, which is a difficult balance to maintain. 5. Time until convention: There is still a considerable amount of time until the Republican National Convention in 2024. This allows for potential shifts in public opinion, unforeseen events, or changes in the candidate field. 6. Fundraising and campaign strength: While Haley has shown some fundraising ability, she is not matching the financial power of Trump or some other potential candidates. 7. Delegate allocation: The Republican primary process and delegate allocation rules favor candidates who can win pluralities in individual states, which currently seems to benefit Trump more than Haley. 8. Potential for consolidation: If other candidates drop out, their supporters might not necessarily flock to Haley, as many are likely to support Trump or other alternatives. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for Nikki Haley to become the nominee, it appears highly unlikely at this point. Trump's dominance in the race, the party's current dynamics, and Haley's relative position all suggest that her chances are quite low.

Historical context: The VXVCLS is a measure of expected volatility in the S&P 500 index over the next 3 months. It tends to increase during periods of market uncertainty and decrease during periods of stability. Current market conditions: As of April 2024, we're experiencing a relatively stable market with moderate volatility. The exact VXVCLS value for July 20, 2023, would be needed for a precise comparison, but we can assume it was at a moderate level. Potential future events: By July 2024, several factors could impact market volatility: a) The U.S. presidential election in November 2024 could create uncertainty. b) Ongoing geopolitical tensions might escalate or subside. c) Economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and global trade could shift. Market cycles: Volatility tends to be cyclical, and periods of low volatility are often followed by higher volatility. Time frame: The question asks about a specific date (July 20, 2024) rather than an average over a period, which makes the prediction more challenging due to potential short-term fluctuations. Mean reversion: Over long periods, volatility tends to revert to its mean. If the current volatility is below average, there's a higher chance it will increase. Given these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher than 50% chance that the VXVCLS will be higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024. The upcoming U.S. election and the potential for economic shifts or geopolitical events could increase market uncertainty. Additionally, if we're currently in a period of relatively low volatility, there's a chance it may increase by next year due to mean reversion. However, this prediction comes with significant uncertainty. The specific date comparison and the numerous unpredictable factors that can influence market volatility make this a challenging forecast."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "c2b31058-557e-4f27-b8f8-88d363b81c96", "title": "Will Israel carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves **Yes** if, following the date of this question's publication and before May 1, 2024, credible reports indicate that an attack attributed to Israel and occurring within Iran's borders has led to the death of at least five individuals.", "resolution_date": "2024-05-01T18:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-13T22:04:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.35, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, we need to consider several factors: 1. Current geopolitical tensions: The relationship between Israel and Iran has been highly strained for years, with both countries viewing each other as significant threats. The recent attack by Iran on Israel (April 13-14, 2024) has dramatically escalated tensions. 2. Historical precedent: Israel has been known to conduct covert operations and targeted strikes against Iranian targets in the past, including assassinations of nuclear scientists and sabotage of nuclear facilities. However, these operations have typically been more limited in scope and casualties. 3. Time frame: The question gives a relatively short window of about two weeks from the creation date to the resolution date. This limited timeframe reduces the likelihood of such an attack being planned and executed. 4. Israeli strategy: Israel often prefers covert operations or targeted strikes rather than large-scale attacks within Iranian territory. A deadly attack causing at least five casualties would be a significant escalation. 5. International pressure: Given the recent Iranian attack on Israel, there might be increased international pressure on both sides to de-escalate the situation, potentially reducing the likelihood of immediate retaliation. 6. Israeli capabilities: Israel has advanced military capabilities and intelligence networks, making such an attack possible if deemed necessary. 7. Potential consequences: A direct attack on Iranian soil with multiple casualties could lead to further escalation and potentially a wider regional conflict, which Israel might want to avoid. 8. Alternative responses: Israel may choose other forms of retaliation or deterrence that don't involve a direct attack on Iranian soil, such as cyber attacks, economic measures, or diplomatic efforts. Considering these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of some form of Israeli response to the recent Iranian attack. However, the specific conditions of this question (at least five deaths, within Iran's borders, before May 1, 2024) make it less likely. Israel may opt for less overt or less deadly forms of retaliation in the short term. That said, the situation is highly volatile, and a rapid escalation cannot be ruled out entirely.

Time frame: The hypothetical attack would occur before May 1, 2024, but the volatility index comparison is for July 20, 2024. This gives about 2.5-3.5 months for markets to potentially stabilize after the initial shock. 3. Historical precedent: Major geopolitical events often cause short-term spikes in volatility, but markets tend to adjust over time unless the situation continues to escalate. 4. Current volatility levels: As of April 2024, the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index is relatively low. An attack could cause a significant increase from these levels. 5. Broader economic factors: Other economic indicators and global events between May and July 2024 could also influence volatility. 6. Market adaptation: Markets often price in geopolitical risks over time, potentially reducing long-term volatility impacts. 7. Potential for continued conflict: An Israeli attack on Iran could lead to ongoing tensions or even broader conflict, which would sustain higher volatility levels.

The initial shock of the attack would likely cause a significant spike in volatility. While this might subside somewhat by July, the ongoing tensions and potential for further conflict in the region would likely keep volatility elevated compared to the previous year. However, there's also a chance that markets could adapt to the new geopolitical reality, especially if there's no further escalation between May and July. Additionally, other economic factors could potentially overshadow the impact of this event by July.

Historical volatility: Looking at the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) over the past few years, we can see that it tends to fluctuate based on various economic and geopolitical factors. However, there's no consistent year-over-year pattern. 3. Economic factors: By July 2024, we'll be further along in the economic cycle. Current concerns about inflation, interest rates, and potential recession might have evolved or resolved, which could affect market volatility. 4. Upcoming U.S. Presidential Election: The U.S. will be heading into a presidential election in November 2024. Historically, election years can bring increased market volatility, especially in the months leading up to the election. 5. Unpredictable events: While the question rules out one specific geopolitical event, other unforeseen global events could still occur and impact market volatility. 6. Current volatility levels: As of April 2023, the VXVCLS is relatively low compared to its historical range. This suggests that there's more room for it to increase than decrease by July 2024. 7. Long-term market trends: Over very long periods, the stock market tends to grow, which can lead to periods of lower volatility.

Given these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher chance that the VXVCLS will be higher on July 20, 2024, compared to July 20, 2023. The main reasons for this are: - The upcoming U.S. presidential election, which could increase market uncertainty. - The current relatively low levels of the VXVCLS, which provide more room for increase. - The potential for other geopolitical or economic events to emerge and increase volatility.

Established candidates: There are already several high-profile Republicans who have announced their candidacy or are strongly considering running, including Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and others. These candidates have more political experience and established bases of support within the party. 3. Carlson's lack of political experience: While he is a well-known media figure, Carlson has never held public office or run a political campaign. This lack of experience would be a significant hurdle in securing the nomination. 4. Time constraints: Given that the resolution date is August 1, 2024, and the Republican National Convention typically occurs in July or August of election years, there is very little time for Carlson to mount a successful campaign if he hasn't already started. 5. Conditional nature of the question: The condition of Republicans retaining Ohio's 6th district doesn't have a strong direct correlation with Carlson's chances of becoming the nominee. While it might indicate some level of Republican support, it's not a determining factor for the presidential nomination. 6. Media influence vs. political support: While Carlson has a significant media presence and influence among conservatives, this doesn't necessarily translate to broad support within the Republican Party establishment or among primary voters. 7. Potential for unexpected events: In politics, unexpected events can dramatically change the landscape. However, for Carlson to become the nominee at this point would require a series of highly improbable events. Given these factors, the probability of Tucker Carlson being the Republican nominee for the 2024 Presidential Election is very low. While not impossible, it would require a dramatic and unlikely series of events to occur in a very short time frame."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "e8fa4ccf-ec03-4b2a-ad93-696c6d4ec57e", "title": "Given the Republican Party loses Ohio's 6th district in the 2024 special election, will Tucker Carlson be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where the Republican Party loses Ohio's 6th congressional district, previously held by Bill Johnson, in the 2024 special election.

The likelihood of Republicans losing Ohio's 6th district: Ohio's 6th district has been a Republican stronghold for years. While special elections can sometimes produce surprising results, it would be unusual for Republicans to lose this seat. However, for the purpose of this question, we assume this loss occurs. 2. The impact of losing OH-6 on the Republican presidential nomination: Losing a traditionally Republican seat might cause some concern within the party, but it's unlikely to dramatically alter the course of the presidential nomination process, which is typically influenced by much broader national trends and dynamics. 3. Tucker Carlson's current position and likelihood of running: As of now, Tucker Carlson is not an announced candidate for the 2024 Republican nomination. He left his position at Fox News in April 2023, which could potentially free him up for a political run. However, he has not indicated any serious intention to run for president. 4. The current Republican field: The Republican field already includes several high-profile candidates, such as Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others. These candidates have been campaigning, raising funds, and building support for months. 5. The timeline: The question resolves on August 1, 2024, which is after the typical timeframe for primary elections and before the Republican National Convention usually takes place. This means the nominee would likely be determined by this point. 6. The likelihood of a late entry: It's extremely rare for a major party to nominate someone who hasn't gone through the primary process. The last time this happened for Republicans was in 1940 with Wendell Willkie. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Tucker Carlson would become the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, even in the scenario where Republicans lose OH-6. While the loss of a traditionally Republican seat might cause some consternation within the party, it's not likely to be so catastrophic as to cause them to completely abandon their existing candidates in favor of someone who hasn't campaigned or participated in the primary process. The scenario described would be an extremely low probability event, requiring not only the loss of OH-6 but also a complete upheaval of the normal nomination process and the sidelining of all current candidates in favor of Carlson."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.006218548205278371, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Time frame: We're looking at the polling average for July 15, 2024, which is about 10 days from the last known data point. This is a relatively short period, so dramatic changes are less likely. 3. Historical volatility: Presidential polling averages tend to fluctuate, but usually not drastically over short periods unless major events occur. 4. Proximity to the election: July 15, 2024, is relatively close to the November 2024 election. Polling tends to become more stable and potentially more accurate as the election approaches. 5. Potential events: We don't know of any specific events scheduled between July 5 and July 15 that could significantly impact the polls. 6. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points, which means small fluctuations are common and expected. Given that Trump's lead is already within the specified range (2.4 points on July 5), and considering the relatively short time frame, it seems quite possible that his lead could remain within this range on July 15. However, there's also a chance it could move slightly above or below this range. The current lead being so close to the lower bound (2 points) introduces some uncertainty. A small shift in Biden's favor could push Trump's lead below 2 points, while a shift in Trump's favor could push it further into the specified range or potentially above it.

Upcoming events: Any scheduled debates, major policy announcements, or unforeseen events in the next 10 days could impact the polls. 6. Aggregation method: 538's polling average is weighted and adjusted, which tends to smooth out sudden changes and extreme polls. Given that Trump is already leading by 2.4 points, it's not implausible that his lead could increase to the 3-4 point range. However, for the question to resolve as YES, the lead needs to be specifically greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points. This is a relatively narrow range. Considering the current trend and the short time frame, it's possible that Trump's lead could increase slightly. However, the specific range required makes it less likely. It's more probable that the lead will either remain close to its current level (below 3 points) or, if it does increase, it might exceed 4 points. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate but not high chance of the lead falling exactly in this range."}}}, "P_given_Q": {"question": {"id": "35aeeb70-ef8a-4725-a3ff-bd7c625ca6dd", "title": "Given Trump's lead over Biden is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, will Joe Biden have an in-person interview on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's national polling average for the 2024 presidential election is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, as reported by Metaculus on July 17, 2024.

Time until the election: July 15, 2024, is relatively close to the election, so polls at that time are likely to be more accurate than earlier polls. 4. Potential Republican nominees: The question assumes Glenn Youngkin is not the nominee, which likely means Trump or another high-profile Republican would be. 5. Biden's age and performance: By July 2024, Biden will be 81, and concerns about his age and mental acuity may impact his polling numbers. 6. Economic and geopolitical factors: The state of the economy and any major world events could significantly influence polling numbers. 7. 538's methodology: 538 is known for its rigorous polling aggregation, which tends to smooth out outliers. Given these factors, I believe it's possible but not highly likely that Trump's lead will fall within the specific 3-4 point range: - Trump having a lead is plausible given current trends and Biden's challenges. - A lead of more than 3 points is significant but not unrealistic given the factors mentioned. - However, the range is quite narrow (between 3 and 4 points), which makes it less likely to occur. - There's a good chance the lead could be smaller or larger than this range.

Individual Neutral Athletes' performance: The question assumes that Individual Neutral Athletes win 15 or more gold medals. This is a significant number of gold medals for a group of athletes not representing a specific country. This could potentially reduce the number of gold medals available for other countries, especially smaller or less competitive nations. 2. Historical context: At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, only three countries won their first-ever gold medals (Bermuda, Philippines, and Qatar). In Rio 2016, five countries won their first gold (Fiji, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, and Singapore). This shows that it's relatively rare for multiple countries to win their first gold in a single Olympics. 3. Remaining countries without gold: As of 2023, there are still over 70 countries that have never won an Olympic gold medal. However, many of these are smaller nations or those with less developed sports programs. 4. Competition level: The Olympics are becoming increasingly competitive, making it harder for new countries to break through and win their first gold. 5. Potential candidates: Some countries that might be in contention for their first gold include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Nepal, or Syria. However, predicting which specific countries might achieve this is challenging. 6. Impact of Individual Neutral Athletes: The strong performance of Individual Neutral Athletes (winning 15+ golds) could potentially take away opportunities from some of these first-time contenders. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that 5 or more countries would win their first-ever gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics, especially considering the strong performance of Individual Neutral Athletes. The historical precedent suggests that 2-3 countries winning their first gold is more common. The assumption of Individual Neutral Athletes winning many golds further reduces the likelihood of this event occurring. However, there's always a possibility for surprises in sports, and the Olympics often produce unexpected results. While it's improbable, it's not impossible for 5 or more countries to achieve this milestone."}}}, "P_given_not_Q": {"question": {"id": "7ec31382-dcd5-4bea-90a0-04b20981b593", "title": "Given Individual Neutral Athletes win fewer than 15 gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, will at least 5 countries win their debut gold medal?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where Individual Neutral Athletes collectively win fewer than 15 gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

Number of countries yet to win gold: As of 2023, there are still over 70 countries that have never won an Olympic gold medal. This provides a large pool of potential first-time winners. 4. Paris 2024 specifics: - New sports: Breakdancing is being introduced, which could provide opportunities for countries strong in this discipline but not traditionally successful in Olympics. - Increased participation: The IOC aims for gender parity, which might lead to more diverse representation and increased chances for new countries to win. 5. Time factor: The question is asked about a month before the Olympics, which means we have recent performance data and team announcements to consider. However, despite these factors, achieving 5 debut gold medals is still a high bar: 1. Olympic success tends to concentrate among a relatively small group of countries due to factors like funding, training infrastructure, and sporting culture. 2. Even with INA winning fewer medals, established sporting powerhouses are likely to claim most of the golds. 3. While there's a large pool of countries without gold, many of these are smaller nations with limited Olympic programs. 4. Historical trends suggest that 1-3 new countries winning gold in a single Olympics is more common than 5 or more.

Given these factors, I believe it's possible but not highly probable that Trump will have a lead in this specific range. Here's why: - Trump maintaining a lead over Biden is plausible given current political dynamics and potential voter fatigue with the incumbent. - However, the specific range of 2-3 points is quite narrow, making it less likely to fall exactly within this range. - There's still a lot of time for events to unfold that could significantly impact polling numbers. - The economy's state in mid-2024 is uncertain and could swing polls in either direction.

This suggests that if Trump's performance in polls is either very strong (>3 points lead) or relatively weak (\u22642 points lead), there might be a scenario where the Republican Party considers an alternative candidate. 3. Ted Cruz's position: Cruz ran for the Republican nomination in 2016 and came second to Trump. He has maintained a high profile in the Senate and has been critical of the Biden administration, keeping his name in the national conversation. 4.

The unpredictability of marathons and the possibility of emerging talent from other regions also need to be considered.

Night Shyamalan's 'Trap' and the IMDB rating of 'House of the Dragon' Season 2, Episode 8. Let's break this down: 1. M. Night Shyamalan's 'Trap': Shyamalan has a history of mixed reception for his films. CinemaScore is based on audience reactions on opening night, which can be unpredictable. A score of B- or lower is quite possible for a Shyamalan film, given his track record. 2. 'House of the Dragon' Season 2, Episode 8: This is the season finale, which typically garners more attention and higher ratings. Season 1 of 'House of the Dragon' was generally well-received. The first season's finale (Episode 10) has an IMDB rating of 9.3. Most episodes of Season 1 were rated above 8.5 on IMDB. 3. Correlation between the two events: There is no apparent direct correlation between these two events. The condition about 'Trap' seems to be a way to add uncertainty to the question rather than having any causal relationship with 'House of the Dragon'. 4. IMDB rating considerations: IMDB ratings tend to be inflated for popular shows, especially for finales. Two days after release is enough time for a significant number of fans to rate the episode, potentially leading to a higher initial score. An 8.5+ rating is high but achievable for a highly anticipated season finale of a popular show. Given the success of the first season of 'House of the Dragon' and the tendency for season finales to be highly rated, there's a good chance that the Season 2 finale will receive a rating above 8.5 on IMDB.

Donald Trump Jr. has not announced any intentions to run for president, and he is not considered a frontrunner or even a serious contender for the 2024 Republican nomination. The current frontrunners are his father, Donald Trump, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. 2. ISS's history with Tesla: Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has a history of recommending against certain Tesla proposals. In the past, they have advised shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's compensation package and Kimbal Musk's re-election to the board. 3. Concerns about Elon Musk's compensation: Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package has been controversial and has faced legal challenges. In January 2023, a Delaware court ruled that the package was excessive. This suggests that ISS might continue to recommend against such large compensation packages. 4. Kimbal Musk's position on the board: Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother, has been criticized for his lack of relevant experience and potential conflicts of interest. ISS has previously recommended against his re-election. 5. Tesla's corporate governance: Tesla has faced ongoing criticism for its corporate governance practices, including the composition of its board and executive compensation. ISS, as a proxy advisor focused on good governance, is likely to continue scrutinizing these aspects. 6. Time frame: The resolution date is set for August 1, 2024, which gives ample time for ISS to make recommendations regarding Tesla's 2024 shareholder meeting. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that ISS will advise against either Elon Musk's compensation package or Kimbal Musk's re-election, or both.

Existing charges: Prosecutors may feel they already have a strong case with the current charges and may not want to complicate it further. 2. Legal strategy: Trump's legal team is likely advising him to be cautious about making statements that could be construed as witness tampering. 3. Public attention: The high-profile nature of the case may make prosecutors more cautious about bringing additional charges without extremely strong evidence. 4.

Probability of Kamala Harris becoming President by July 26, 2024, if Trump is charged: Even if Trump is charged, this doesn't directly lead to Harris becoming President.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would both drop out of the race and announce his resignation from the presidency: 1. There's no current indication of such plans. 2. A strong dollar would generally be seen as positive for his re-election chances. 3. The timeframe is very tight between the potential announcement and the currency condition. 4. Such a drastic move would be unprecedented in modern US politics without extreme circumstances (e.g., severe health issues), which we have no reason to anticipate.

Political landscape: The 2024 election will be approaching, and Biden's approval ratings and party support will be crucial factors in his decision-making. 4. Precedent: It's extremely rare for a sitting US president to drop out of a re-election campaign and resign, especially this close to an election. The last president to not seek re-election was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, but he didn't resign. 5. Conditional nature of the question: The currency condition adds an extra layer of uncertainty, as it's difficult to predict both the economic situation and Biden's response to it. 6.

This recent track record is strong and suggests they have been consistently producing competitive entries. 3. Cultural impact: Iceland has a unique musical culture that often resonates well with Eurovision audiences. They've had some memorable entries that have gained popularity beyond the contest. 4. Selection process: Iceland typically uses a national selection process called S\u00f6ngvakeppnin to choose their entry. This allows them to select a song that has already proven popular with domestic audiences, potentially increasing its chances internationally. 5. Competition level: The level of competition can vary from year to year, and we don't yet know the quality of other entries for 2024.

Competition level: The overall quality of entries from other countries and the competitiveness of Ireland's particular semi-final will affect their chances. 5.

However, this hasn't been enough to secure qualification in recent years. 6. Staging and performance: The visual presentation and live vocal performance on the night of the semi-final can greatly influence voting. 7. Changes in approach: After several years of non-qualification, Ireland may be motivated to make significant changes to their selection process or overall Eurovision strategy to improve their chances. 8. Unpredictability: Eurovision results can be unpredictable, with surprises and upsets occurring regularly.

First, we need to consider the likelihood of Donald Trump being charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024. Given the ongoing investigations and the seriousness of the allegations, there is a non-trivial chance this could happen. However, legal processes can be slow, and the specific charge of witness tampering may not be the focus of the prosecution. Assuming Trump is charged as specified, we then need to consider the probability of Joe Biden both dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and resigning from the presidency before the end of July 2024. This is an extremely unlikely scenario for several reasons: a) Joe Biden has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election in 2024. b) There is no clear connection between Trump being charged and Biden's decision to continue in office or run for re-election. c) Resigning from the presidency is an extraordinarily rare event in U.S. history, having happened only once with Richard Nixon. d) Biden dropping out and resigning would likely be seen as a major victory for his political opponents, which he would be highly reluctant to grant. e) Such a decision would be hugely disruptive to the Democratic Party and the country as a whole, especially so close to a presidential election. The timeframe for these events is also quite tight. Even if Trump were charged, Biden would have less than two months to make and announce such a monumental decision. There are no current indications that Biden is considering either dropping out of the race or resigning from the presidency, let alone both.

Biden's age and health: Biden will be 81 in 2024, and concerns about his age and fitness for office have been raised. However, he has maintained that he is capable of serving another term. 4. Political landscape: A sudden decision to both drop out of the race and resign would be extremely unusual and would likely only occur under extraordinary circumstances, such as a severe health crisis or a major political scandal. 5. Succession implications: If Biden were to resign, Vice President Kamala Harris would become President. This would be a significant political shift that Biden and the Democratic Party would not take lightly. 6.

Historical precedent: The Democratic Party has never nominated a woman for president in its general election history, with Hillary Clinton in 2016 being the only exception. This suggests a historical bias towards male candidates. 3. Potential female candidates: While there are several prominent female Democrats who could potentially run (e.g., Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar), none have announced their candidacy or shown strong indications of challenging Biden. 4. Incumbent advantage: Historically, incumbent presidents rarely face serious primary challenges from their own party. This further strengthens Biden's position. 5. Vice President Kamala Harris: As the current Vice President, Harris would be the most likely female candidate if Biden decides not to run. However, her approval ratings have been relatively low, which could impact her chances if she were to run. 6. Time until nomination: With the nomination still over a year away, there is some possibility for unexpected events or changes in the political landscape that could affect the outcome. 7.

Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in several states to remove Trump from the ballot using this argument. Colorado and Maine have already made decisions to remove Trump from their primary ballots, though these decisions are being appealed. 3.

The Colorado and Maine decisions, although under appeal, show that there is willingness in some states to take this action. Even if the Supreme Court rules against Colorado's decision, it's possible that another state might find a way to distinguish their case or interpret the ruling differently. However, the Supreme Court's decision will be pivotal. If they rule decisively against removing Trump from ballots, it would significantly reduce the likelihood of this outcome. Conversely, if they uphold Colorado's decision or leave room for interpretation, it increases the chances of at least one state maintaining such a ban by the resolution date.
