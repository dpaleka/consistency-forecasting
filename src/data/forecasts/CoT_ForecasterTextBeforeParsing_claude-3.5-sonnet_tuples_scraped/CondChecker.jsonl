Incumbent advantage: Historically, sitting presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless facing significant health issues or extremely low approval ratings. Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There are concerns about his age and stamina, which could potentially lead to a decision not to run. 3. Current intentions: As of now (July 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has already launched his 2024 campaign. 4. Democratic Party support: The Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden, and there is no strong push from within the party for him to step aside. 5. Political landscape: The Republican field is still taking shape, and Biden may see himself as the strongest candidate to defeat potential Republican nominees. 6. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is relatively late in the election cycle. Most candidates, especially incumbents, would have made their intentions clear well before this date. 7. Potential for unexpected events: While unlikely, there's always a possibility of unforeseen circumstances (health issues, family concerns, or major political scandals) that could cause Biden to reconsider his candidacy. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he will not accept the nomination before July 15, 2024. He has already launched his campaign, has party support, and barring any major unforeseen circumstances, is likely to continue his bid for re-election.

Current political landscape: Joe Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee for 2024. His decision not to run would significantly shake up the Democratic primary race. 2. Kamala Harris's position: As the current Vice President, Harris would likely be seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination if Biden were to step aside. 3. Timing: The scenario gives us about a month between Biden's potential announcement (by July 15, 2024) and the date we're checking Harris's odds (August 9, 2024). This is a relatively short time frame in political terms, but enough for initial reactions and adjustments in polling and forecasting models. 4. Nate Silver's model: Silver's models are known for being data-driven and responsive to changing political dynamics. A major event like an incumbent president stepping aside would likely cause significant shifts in the model's predictions. 5. The specific probability threshold: 46.6% is a relatively high bar for a candidate's Electoral College probability, especially this far out from the election and in a potentially crowded field. 6. Harris's current standing: While she's the VP, Harris has faced some challenges in popularity and hasn't always polled strongly as a potential presidential candidate. 7. Potential competitors: Other Democratic figures might enter the race if Biden steps aside, potentially splitting the vote and affecting Harris's chances. Given these factors, I believe there's a good chance Harris's odds would increase above 46.6% in this scenario, but it's not certain. The sudden absence of Biden would likely boost Harris's position as the most prominent Democratic figure, and her role as VP would give her a significant advantage in name recognition and perceived experience. However, the high threshold of 46.6% and the potential for a crowded field introduce some uncertainty. Additionally, Harris's own popularity challenges could limit her surge in the model.

Legal precedent: There have been attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates, but they have rarely been successful. The most notable recent case was the attempt to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene from the ballot in Georgia, which failed. 2. Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in multiple states to remove Trump from the ballot using the 14th Amendment. The most prominent cases are in Colorado and Minnesota, where lawsuits have been filed. 3. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which gives ample time for legal challenges to be filed, argued, and potentially appealed through various court levels. 4. Political climate: The use of the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump is highly controversial and politically charged. This could lead to intense scrutiny and potential intervention from higher courts, including the Supreme Court. 5. State-by-state variation: Different states may interpret and apply the 14th Amendment differently, increasing the chances that at least one state might remove Trump from the ballot. 6. Trump's actions on January 6th: The argument for disqualification hinges on whether Trump's actions related to the January 6th Capitol riot constitute 'engaging in insurrection or rebellion.' This is a matter of legal interpretation and debate. 7. Potential Supreme Court involvement: Given the high-stakes nature of this issue, it's likely that any successful attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would be quickly appealed, possibly reaching the Supreme Court before the resolution date. 8. Precedent-setting nature: Courts may be hesitant to set a precedent of removing a major presidential candidate from the ballot, which could influence their decisions. Considering these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that at least one state will attempt to remove Trump from the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. However, the likelihood of this removal being upheld through potential legal challenges and remaining in effect by July 15, 2024, is lower. The unprecedented nature of such an action, combined with the likely intense legal battles and potential Supreme Court involvement, makes it more probable that Trump will remain on the ballots in all states by the resolution date. However, given the multiple ongoing efforts and the possibility of success in at least one state, I don't think the probability is negligible.

However, such a serious legal obstacle could cause some party leaders and delegates to reconsider their support. 3. Precedent and constitutionality: There's no modern precedent for invoking Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify a presidential candidate. The situation would likely lead to intense legal battles and constitutional debates. 4. Alternative candidates: If Trump is blocked, other Republican candidates might gain more traction and support from delegates who previously supported Trump. 5. Timing: The scenario specifies July 15, 2024, which is very close to the typical timing of the Republican National Convention (usually held in July or August). This leaves little time for legal challenges to be fully resolved. 6. Party unity concerns: Nominating a candidate who has been officially removed or blocked from a ballot could be seen as a significant risk for the party's chances in the general election. 7. Delegate loyalty: Many delegates might remain loyal to Trump despite the legal challenges, arguing that the removal is politically motivated or unconstitutional. 8.

Donald Trump being removed or blocked from a primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024: - There have been attempts to use the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running, but so far, these efforts have not been successful at the state level. - The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on this issue, which could provide clarity on the matter. - Even if some states attempt to remove Trump from the ballot, it's likely that legal challenges would ensue, potentially reversing such decisions before July 15, 2024. - The probability of this occurring and remaining in effect by July 15, 2024, seems relatively low, perhaps around 20-30%. 2. Donald Trump being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: - Trump is currently the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. - He has a strong base of support within the Republican Party. - However, there are still primary elections to be held, and other candidates could potentially gain momentum. - Legal issues and potential convictions could impact his candidacy. - The probability of Trump becoming the nominee is higher, perhaps around 70-80%. For both conditions to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities. However, there's an important consideration: if Trump is removed from ballots, it could significantly impact his ability to become the nominee. Conversely, if he becomes the nominee, it might make states more reluctant to remove him from ballots.

The probability of death in such a short timeframe is generally low for any individual, barring known severe health issues or external factors. 4.

Kennedy in 1963, and none have died of natural causes while in office since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945. Given these factors, the probability of Joe Biden dying before Saturday, July 27th, 2024, is very low.

This reinforces that we're dealing with a full transfer of power, not a temporary situation. 5. Historical Precedent: In past cases of presidential deaths (e.g., Kennedy, Roosevelt), the Vice President was sworn in as the new President very quickly, often within hours.

Several points to consider: a) The timeframe is very short - less than two weeks between the potential Harris presidency and Biden's potential dropout. b) For Harris to become President or Acting President, something significant would have to happen to Biden. This could be a serious health issue, a scandal, or some other major event that would force him to step aside. c) If such an event were to occur, it's highly likely that it would also cause Biden to drop out of the race almost immediately. d) The 25th Amendment allows for a temporary transfer of power to the Vice President if the President is unable to discharge their duties. If this were invoked, it might not necessarily mean Biden would drop out of the race, especially if it were seen as a temporary measure. e) However, given the proximity to the election and the potential political fallout, even a temporary transfer of power might effectively end Biden's campaign. f) The Democratic Party would likely put immense pressure on Biden to officially drop out quickly to allow for a smooth transition and to present a united front. g) The timing of the question (created on July 8, 2024) suggests this is a hypothetical scenario rather than based on any current events or known health issues of President Biden.

Former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are generally considered the leading contenders. 3. Individual standings: a. Vivek Ramaswamy is a political newcomer with limited name recognition. While he has gained some attention, he's not considered a top-tier candidate. b. Mike Pence, despite being a former Vice President, has struggled to gain significant traction in early polling and fundraising efforts. 4. Party dynamics: The Republican Party is unlikely to nominate two candidates who are not at the forefront of the race. Additionally, the party typically seeks to balance the ticket, which nominating two similar candidates would not achieve. 5. Logistical and legal issues: The U.S. electoral system is set up for a single presidential candidate from each major party. Nominating two candidates would create significant complications in terms of ballot access and electoral college votes. 6. Timing: The question specifies that this would be decided at the Republican National Convention, which typically occurs after a clear front-runner has emerged through the primary process. Given these factors, it is extremely improbable that both Ramaswamy and Pence would be selected as the Republican nominees. The scenario described in the question would require a complete upheaval of the traditional nomination process and the current political landscape, which is highly unlikely."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0024116422328756245, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(b) 10 or more Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out before July 20: 1. This is a much more dramatic action than signing a letter opposing early nomination. 2. Calling for the sitting president of your own party to drop out is extremely rare and politically risky. 3. There's no indication in the provided information that such a movement is currently underway among Democratic Senators. 4. The timeframe is even shorter for this part (until July 20th). 5. It would require a significant and rapid shift in the political landscape for this to occur. This part seems highly unlikely. I'd estimate the probability at less than 5%.

However, the question is conditional on at least 5 countries winning their first medal, which is an unusual scenario. 2. Number of participating countries: There are over 200 National Olympic Committees, but many have already won medals. The pool of potential first-time medalists is smaller than it used to be. 3. Difficulty of winning gold vs. any medal: Winning a gold medal is significantly more challenging than winning any medal (bronze or silver). This makes it less likely for countries to win their first gold compared to their first medal of any kind. 4. Competitive landscape: Some sports have dominant countries that consistently win gold, making it harder for newcomers to break through. 5. Emerging sports: The introduction of new Olympic sports can sometimes provide opportunities for countries to excel in areas where traditional powerhouses haven't established dominance. 6. Conditional probability: The question is asking about a scenario that's already unusual (5+ countries winning first medals), which might indicate a Games where more countries are breaking through. Given these factors, if we assume the condition is met (5+ countries win their first medal), it does increase the likelihood of multiple countries also winning their first gold. However, the jump from any medal to a gold medal is significant. Let's say hypothetically 7 countries win their first medal. It's plausible that 1-3 of these might be gold, but it's less likely that 5 or more would be gold. The condition being met suggests an Olympics with more breakthrough performances, but gold medals are still the hardest to achieve. Considering all these factors, I would estimate that even in this scenario, there's less than a 50% chance that 5 or more countries would win their first gold medal.

The time frame (about a year from now) seems sufficient for OpenAI to navigate regulatory challenges. Given these factors, I'd estimate a high probability (around 80-85%) that ChatGPT will be generally available in the EU by June 30, 2024. (b) Regarding the market reaching 377 traders by July 15, 2024: The market has over a year to accumulate traders. Manifold Markets is growing in popularity among forecasters. The topic (ChatGPT availability in the EU) is likely to remain relevant and interesting to traders. 377 traders is a significant but not unreasonable number for a long-running, interesting question. However, we don't have information about the current number of traders or the typical growth rate of traders on Manifold Markets. Considering these factors, I'd estimate a moderate to high probability (around 70-75%) that the market will reach 377 traders by July 15, 2024. For the overall question to resolve as YES, both (a) and (b) need to occur.

The current situation in Ukraine: As of April 2024, the war in Ukraine is ongoing, and the front lines have been relatively stable for some time. Chasiv Yar is a strategically important town in the Donetsk region, close to Bakhmut. Russian control of this area would represent a significant advance. 2. Impact on US foreign policy: If Russia were to gain control of Chasiv Yar by June 1, 2024, it would likely be seen as a failure of US and NATO support for Ukraine. This could potentially damage Biden's foreign policy credentials. 3. Biden's current stance on re-election: As of April 2024, Joe Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024 and is the presumptive Democratic nominee. 4. Timing of the hypothetical scenario: The scenario occurs very close to the Democratic National Convention, which is typically held in July or August. 5. Biden's age and health: Biden would be 81 at the start of a second term, and concerns about his age and fitness for office have been ongoing topics of discussion. Given these factors, it's unlikely that Biden would suddenly decide not to accept the nomination based solely on this development in Ukraine. Here's why: a) While the loss of Chasiv Yar would be a setback, it's not likely to be catastrophic enough to cause Biden to abandon his re-election bid. b) Biden has consistently supported Ukraine, and withdrawing from the race might be seen as abandoning that commitment. c) The Democratic Party would be left in a difficult position if their presumptive nominee withdrew so close to the convention. d) Biden has shown determination to run despite ongoing concerns about his age and criticisms of his performance. However, there is a small chance that this event, combined with other factors (such as a sudden health issue or a dramatic shift in polling), could lead to Biden reconsidering his candidacy.

Impact of Ramaswamy's hypothetical nomination: If Ramaswamy were to become the nominee, it might actually increase the likelihood of charges against Trump. This is because it would indicate that the Republican party has moved away from Trump, potentially reducing political pressure against prosecuting him. 6. Ongoing investigations: The Georgia investigation is already well underway, and prosecutors have indicated they are considering various charges, including racketeering and solicitation of election fraud. However, there are also factors that make this scenario less likely: 1. Legal caution: Trump and his legal team are likely aware of the risks of witness tampering and may be more cautious about making public statements. 2. Prosecutorial discretion: Prosecutors might choose to focus on other, potentially stronger charges rather than witness tampering. 3. Time constraints: The legal process can be slow, and while the investigation is ongoing, bringing formal charges by June 1, 2024, is not guaranteed. Given these factors, I believe there is a moderate probability that Trump could be charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024, assuming Ramaswamy is the Republican nominee.

(a) Taylor Swift cameo in Deadpool and Wolverine: Taylor Swift is known for making surprise appearances and cameos in various media. She has a connection to the Marvel universe through her friendship with Ryan Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively. There have been rumors and fan theories about her potential involvement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, no official announcement or credible leak has confirmed her appearance in this specific movie. The movie's plot and full cast are still largely under wraps. Given Swift's popularity and the potential marketing boost her cameo would provide, it's possible but not certain. (b) Deadpool & Wolverine having the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie: The current record for an R-rated movie opening weekend is held by 'Joker' (2019) at $234 million globally. Deadpool and Wolverine are both extremely popular characters with established fan bases. The movie combines two major franchises (X-Men and Deadpool) which could amplify interest. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are major stars with significant box office draw. The Marvel brand typically performs very well at the box office. However, the R-rating limits the potential audience compared to PG-13 superhero movies. The movie needs to surpass $284.5 million globally, which is a significant increase from the current record. The global box office has been somewhat unpredictable post-pandemic. Combining these factors: While both events are possible, they each face significant hurdles. The Taylor Swift cameo is speculative at this point, reducing the overall probability. The box office performance, while likely to be strong, needs to break the existing record by a substantial margin. The probability of both events occurring together is lower than either event occurring individually.

Current intentions: Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election in 2024, and he officially launched his campaign on April 25, 2023. 3.

This has raised some concerns about his fitness for office. 4. Approval ratings: While Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, they are not catastrophically low to the point where it would be unprecedented for him to run again. 5. Democratic Party support: Despite some concerns about Biden's age, the Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind him, and there are no strong challengers within the party. 6.

It's highly unlikely for an incumbent president to drop out so late in the process. 7.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he will not accept the nomination before July 15, 2024. He has already launched his re-election campaign and has the support of his party. While concerns about his age persist, they are not new and have not deterred him so far.

Political landscape: The district is largely rural and has traditionally favored conservative candidates. In the 2020 presidential election, Trump won this district by a significant margin. 3. Impact of Biden's hypothetical withdrawal: If Biden were to announce he's not accepting the Democratic nomination, it could potentially energize Republican voters and demoralize some Democratic voters. However, it might also motivate Democrats to rally behind a new candidate. 4. Timing of the special election: The special election would likely occur before the 2024 general election, meaning it would happen in a political climate where Republicans might have an advantage due to the uncertainty in the Democratic presidential race. 5. Local factors: Local issues and candidate quality can play a significant role in special elections. Without knowing the specific candidates, it's hard to account for this factor. 6. National political climate: While Biden's hypothetical withdrawal could shake up the national political scene, the effects on a local special election might be limited. 7. Midterm election trends: Typically, the party not in control of the White House tends to perform better in midterm and off-year elections. This could favor Republicans in a special election. Given these factors, especially the historical voting patterns of the district and its rural, conservative-leaning composition, it seems highly likely that the Republicans would retain this seat even in the scenario where Biden withdraws from the presidential race. The district's strong Republican lean and the potential for increased Republican enthusiasm following such a major Democratic shake-up would likely outweigh any potential Democratic surge.

While there has been some speculation about his age and fitness for office, he has consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. It would be highly unusual for a sitting president to withdraw from seeking re-election, especially this late in the process.

The Guardian Council, which vets candidates, has rejected his candidacy in the past. Impact of a hypothetical Israeli attack: Such an attack would likely escalate tensions between Iran and Israel, potentially shifting Iran's political landscape towards a more hardline stance. Ahmadinejad's appeal in crisis: In times of heightened conflict, Ahmadinejad's anti-Israel rhetoric and hardline positions might become more appealing to the Iranian establishment. Guardian Council's considerations: The Council might view Ahmadinejad as a strong voice against Israel in the wake of an attack, potentially increasing his chances of approval. Internal politics: Despite potential external factors, internal power dynamics and the Supreme Leader's preferences still play a crucial role in candidate approval. Timing: The hypothetical attack occurs close to the election, which could influence decision-making processes. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance the Guardian Council would approve Ahmadinejad as a candidate under these circumstances.

The recent attack on Iran's consulate in Damascus, attributed to Israel, has significantly escalated tensions. However, a direct, overt attack by Israel on Iranian soil would be a major escalation and could potentially lead to a wider regional conflict. The timeframe is relatively short (less than three weeks from the question's creation date), which reduces the likelihood of such a significant event occurring.

Name recognition: While Ramaswamy has gained some attention, he still lacks the widespread name recognition that other candidates possess. This can be a significant hurdle in a national primary race. 3. Political experience: Ramaswamy is a businessman and author with no prior political experience. Historically, candidates with political backgrounds (governors, senators, etc.) tend to have an advantage in presidential primaries. 4. Fundraising: While Ramaswamy has personal wealth, his campaign fundraising efforts may not match those of more established candidates, which can limit his ability to compete effectively across multiple states. 5. Policy positions: Ramaswamy has taken some unconventional stances that may appeal to certain segments of the Republican base but might not have broad appeal across the entire party. 6. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still many months away, which theoretically gives Ramaswamy time to build support. However, it also means there's time for other candidates to consolidate their positions. 7.

Let's break it down: 1. Condition: Vivek Ramaswamy becomes the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election. - This is highly unlikely. Ramaswamy is a political outsider with limited experience and name recognition compared to other potential Republican candidates. 2. Outcome: Rishi Sunak fails to be elected as a Member of Parliament in the July 4, 2024 UK general election. - Rishi Sunak is currently the Prime Minister of the UK and leader of the Conservative Party. - UK Prime Ministers typically run in safe seats to ensure their election to Parliament. - Sunak currently represents Richmond (Yorks), a constituency he won with a large majority in 2019. 3. Connection between the condition and outcome: - There's no direct causal link between Ramaswamy's nomination and Sunak's electoral prospects. - However, if Ramaswamy were to become the nominee, it might signal a global shift towards political outsiders, which could potentially influence UK politics. 4. UK political landscape: - The Conservative Party has been in power since 2010 and is facing challenges due to economic issues and political scandals. - Recent polls show Labour leading the Conservatives, indicating a potential change in government. - However, this doesn't necessarily mean Sunak would lose his own seat. 5. Timing: - The US Republican nomination typically occurs in July-August of the election year. - The question specifies a UK general election on July 4, 2024, which would likely precede the Republican nomination. Given these factors, even if the unlikely event of Ramaswamy's nomination occurs, it's still improbable that Sunak would fail to be elected as an MP. Prime Ministers typically run in safe seats, and Sunak has a strong majority in his current constituency. While the Conservative Party may face challenges nationally, losing his own seat would be an extreme outcome. The timing issue also makes the connection between the two events less relevant, as the UK election would likely occur before the Republican nomination."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "8033a088-5728-42df-9770-4407ef6d574f", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Vivek Ramaswamy be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election and (b) Rishi Sunak fail to be elected in the 2024 UK General Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met: (1) Vivek Ramaswamy is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, and (2) Rishi Sunak fails to be elected as a Member of Parliament in the July 4 2024 UK general election. \n\nFor condition (1), it is not relevant who receives the Republican nomination on the day of the 2024 US election; it is solely determined by who is selected by the delegates of the [Republican National Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention).\n\nFor condition (2), the question resolves as **Yes** if for any reason Rishi Sunak fails to be elected as a Member of Parliament in the July 4 2024 UK general election.

As of now, more established figures like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and Nikki Haley are leading in polls and have more name recognition. While Ramaswamy has gained some attention, his chances of securing the nomination are quite low. I would estimate the probability of this occurring at around 0.05 or 5%. 2.

Let's break it down: 1. Legal basis: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies individuals who have 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' against the United States from holding federal office. Some argue that Trump's actions surrounding the January 6th Capitol riot could fall under this category. 2. Current legal challenges: As of now, there are ongoing efforts in several states to use the 14th Amendment to keep Trump off the ballot. Colorado and Maine have already made decisions to remove Trump from their primary ballots, though these decisions are being appealed. 3. Supreme Court involvement: The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the Colorado case, with arguments scheduled for February 8, 2024. Their decision will likely set a precedent for other states. 4. Timeline: The question specifies July 15, 2024, as the date of resolution. This gives ample time for legal processes to unfold, including potential Supreme Court rulings. 5. State-by-state decisions: Even if the Supreme Court rules against Trump, individual states may still need to make their own determinations, which could lead to variations across the country. 6. Political considerations: Some states, particularly those with Republican-controlled governments, may be reluctant to remove Trump from the ballot regardless of court rulings. 7. Potential for reinstatement: The question specifies that if Trump is removed and then reinstated by July 15, 2024, it resolves negatively. This adds an extra layer of uncertainty. Given these factors, I believe there is a significant chance that Trump will be removed from at least one state's ballot by July 15, 2024. The Supreme Court's decision will be crucial, but even if they rule against disqualification, some states may still attempt to keep him off the ballot. The fact that two states have already made this decision (albeit under appeal) suggests that there's a real possibility of it happening in at least one state by the specified date. However, there are also substantial uncertainties. The Supreme Court could rule definitively in Trump's favor, making it difficult for states to justify removal. Additionally, political pressures and the potential for reinstatement add to the uncertainty.

There have been discussions and some legal attempts to use the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running, based on his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot. However, as of now, no state has successfully removed him from the ballot on these grounds. Several factors make this condition less likely: a) Legal challenges: Any attempt to remove Trump from the ballot would face significant legal challenges and likely end up in the Supreme Court. b) Time constraints: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which is relatively close to the general election. Many primaries will have already occurred by then. c) Political considerations: States might be hesitant to take such a controversial step, fearing backlash or accusations of interfering with the democratic process. However, there are also factors that increase the possibility: a) Ongoing investigations: Trump is facing several legal challenges, which could potentially provide more evidence to support a 14th Amendment case. b) Precedent: In 2022, a New Mexico court removed a county commissioner from office under the 14th Amendment for participating in the January 6th events.

This internal pressure could accelerate decision-making processes. 5. Precedent: The EU has previously imposed tariffs on other Chinese goods in various sectors, showing a willingness to use such measures. 6. Economic considerations: The EU must balance protecting its domestic industry with maintaining good trade relations with China and ensuring affordable EVs for consumers. 7.

While she has gained some support from moderate Republicans and Democrats, she has faced significant backlash from the Republican base. She lost her House seat in Wyoming due to her stance against Trump, which indicates a lack of support from her own party.

While there have been concerns about his age and some polls showing low approval ratings, Biden and his team have consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running.

This suggests a long-standing struggle to reach the highest level of success. 6.

Breaking this record is a significant challenge, as it has stood for over a decade. While athletes continue to improve, such a breakthrough is not guaranteed. 2. The status of Individual Neutral Athletes (INA): INAs are typically athletes from countries facing international sanctions or other issues preventing them from competing under their national flag. In recent years, this has primarily applied to Russian and Belarusian athletes due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. 3. Historical performance of Russian athletes (as they are likely to make up a significant portion of INAs): Russia has traditionally been a strong performer in the Olympics, often ranking in the top 5 in the medal table. However, their participation as INAs would likely reduce their overall medal count due to restrictions in team events and potentially fewer athletes competing. 4. The number of gold medals required (15): This is a substantial number of gold medals for a group of neutral athletes. For context, in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) won 20 gold medals competing as a team. 5. The conditional nature of the question: The question only applies if the men's 100m dash record is broken, which itself is a relatively low probability event. This condition doesn't directly affect the performance of INAs but does add another layer of uncertainty. Given these factors, I believe the probability of INAs winning 15 or more gold medals, conditional on the 100m record being broken, is relatively low. The record being broken doesn't substantially impact the likelihood of INA success, and 15 gold medals is a high bar for a group of neutral athletes who may face restrictions on participation.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for new leadership, there hasn't been a significant movement within the party to push him out. For this to happen, there would need to be a major shift in party dynamics or a significant event that drastically reduces Biden's viability as a candidate. Given the relatively short timeframe (before July 20th, 2024) and the potential political consequences of such a move, this seems unlikely. I'd estimate this probability at around 10%.

Voting patterns: Neither country has strong diaspora voting or consistent voting allies, which can be a disadvantage. 5. Song quality and performance: We don't know the songs or performers for 2024 yet, which adds uncertainty. 6. Participation confirmation: As of now, we don't have official confirmation of their participation in 2024. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that both countries will qualify. Czechia's qualification rate is relatively low, while Georgia's has been declining in recent years. The uncertainty about their 2024 entries and the competitive nature of Eurovision make it difficult to predict a dual qualification confidently. However, surprises do happen in Eurovision, and both countries have shown the ability to qualify in the past. If both countries send strong entries and perform well, there's a chance they could both make it through. Considering all these factors, I would estimate a relatively low probability of both countries qualifying."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.008645088936490741, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0028816963121635806, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.2181320621539169, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, was a swimmer who dominated multiple Olympics. 2. Nature of swimming events: Swimming has many events (different strokes, distances, and relays) allowing talented swimmers to compete in multiple races, increasing their chances of winning multiple medals. 3. Current swimming stars: We need to consider the current top swimmers who are likely to compete in 2024. For example, Caeleb Dressel (USA) won five gold medals in Tokyo 2020, showing the potential for swimmers to dominate. 4. Competition from other sports: We must also consider strong contenders from other sports, particularly those with multiple events like gymnastics, athletics, or cycling. 5. Team sports vs. individual sports: Individual sports like swimming generally offer more opportunities for a single athlete to win multiple medals compared to team sports. 6. Recent Olympic trends: In Tokyo 2020, swimmers did very well, with Caeleb Dressel (USA, swimming) and Emma McKeon (AUS, swimming) among the top medal winners. 7. Time until the Olympics: With the Olympics about a year away, current form and potential injuries could still affect the outcome. Given these factors, swimmers have a strong historical and structural advantage in winning multiple medals. The nature of swimming events and the presence of multi-event swimmers like Dressel give swimming a high chance of producing the top gold medal winner. However, there's always the possibility of exceptional performances in other sports or unexpected developments. The main competition likely comes from gymnastics and athletics, but these sports typically don't offer as many gold medal opportunities to a single athlete as swimming does.

This demonstrates her ability to perform at the highest level in major competitions. Competition: The women's 100m field is highly competitive, with strong contenders like Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Elaine Thompson-Herah, and Shericka Jackson. Richardson will need to maintain her peak form to outperform these athletes. Multiple opportunities: Richardson has two chances to win gold - in the individual 100m event and potentially in the 4x100m relay. This increases her overall probability of winning a gold medal. Age and experience: At 24 years old during the 2024 Olympics, Richardson will be in her prime athletic years. She has also gained valuable experience from her recent success, which could help her handle the pressure of the Olympics. Consistency: While Richardson has shown brilliance, her performances have been somewhat inconsistent in the past. She'll need to maintain her top form throughout the Olympic cycle and during the Games. Potential for improvement: Given her age and trajectory, there's a possibility that Richardson could further improve her times before the Olympics, enhancing her chances of gold. Olympic pressure: The Olympics present a unique pressure environment. While Richardson has performed well at the World Championships, the Olympics are a different stage that can affect athletes differently. Relay team strength: If Richardson participates in the 4x100m relay, the strength of the US team as a whole will impact her chances of winning gold in that event. Considering these factors, Richardson has a strong chance of winning a gold medal, particularly in the 100m event.

Public opinion polls vs. Manifold respondents: The prompt mentions that public opinion polls show Biden losing to Trump, while other Democrats perform better. However, we need to consider if Manifold respondents are representative of the general public. Manifold users are likely to be more politically engaged and potentially more informed than the average voter, which could lead to different results. 2. Current poll standings: As of now, we don't have access to the current standings of the two polls mentioned. This makes it difficult to predict the final outcome accurately. 3. Time frame: The polls close on July 6, which is only a few days from the creation date of this question (July 4). This short time frame limits the potential for significant shifts in opinion. 4. 3% threshold: The question asks if Trump will gain at least 3% when facing Biden compared to a generic Democrat. This is a significant threshold, especially considering the short time frame. 5. Perception of Biden vs. generic Democrat: Generally, a generic Democrat tends to perform better in polls than a specific candidate because people can project their ideal qualities onto the generic option. Biden, being a known quantity with both strengths and weaknesses, might perform worse than a generic Democrat. 6. Trump's consistent base: Trump has a relatively consistent and loyal base of supporters. This could mean that his performance might not vary as much between facing Biden or a generic Democrat. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that Trump will perform better against Biden than against a generic Democrat among Manifold respondents. However, the 3% threshold is quite high for such a short time frame, and without knowing the current poll standings, it's difficult to be certain.

The time frame between the poll (July 6, 2024) and the target date (August 9, 2024). Let's break it down: 1. The condition is assumed to be met, so we don't need to evaluate its likelihood. 2. If Trump gains significantly against Biden, it could be seen as increasing the likelihood of a Trump victory in the 2024 election. This perception could impact the forex market, but the direction is not entirely clear. Trump's policies during his previous term were mixed for the USD - his tax cuts and deregulation were generally positive, but his trade wars and unpredictability sometimes caused volatility. 3. As of July 2023, the USD/JPY rate is around 144-145. Historical data shows that the rate has been volatile but has generally stayed within the 100-150 range over the past decade. 4. Factors influencing the USD/JPY rate include: - Interest rate differentials between the US and Japan - Economic growth in both countries - Geopolitical events - Trade balances - Central bank policies 5. The month between the poll and the target date is relatively short in macroeconomic terms, but political events can cause short-term volatility. Given these factors, I believe that while Trump's increased polling could have some impact on the USD/JPY rate, it's unlikely to be the dominant factor. The Japanese yen has been relatively weak against the dollar recently due to the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy compared to the Fed's tightening. Unless there's a significant shift in these policies, the trend is likely to continue. However, reaching and maintaining a level of 145 or higher is still a relatively strong position for the dollar. While it's certainly possible, especially given recent trends, it's not a certainty. There's always the potential for unexpected events or policy changes that could strengthen the yen or weaken the dollar.

Let's analyze each part separately: (a) Trump gaining at least 3% among Manifold respondents when facing Biden instead of a generic Democrat: Public opinion polls consistently show Biden losing to Trump outside the margin of error, while other Democrats perform better against Trump. This suggests that Biden is currently a weaker candidate than a generic Democrat. The polls on Manifold are set to close on July 6, which is very soon from the creation date of this question (July 4). Given the short timeframe, it's likely that current public sentiment will be reflected in the Manifold polls.

However, predicting currency movements over a year in advance is highly uncertain. I estimate there's about a 55% chance of this part occurring.

Kamala Harris as the presumptive nominee: If Biden were to drop out, Harris would likely become the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, but it's not guaranteed she would automatically become the nominee. 3.

Recent trends: Ireland has struggled to qualify for the Grand Final in recent years. Since 2013, they have only qualified three times (2013, 2018, and 2021). Selection process: The quality of the song and performer chosen by Ireland will play a crucial role. As of now, we don't know who will represent Ireland or what song they will perform.

Ireland's chances are lower, perhaps around 40% based on recent struggles but potential for improvement. For both to qualify, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26 or 26%.

Let's break it down: 1. Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average: - Current polling data (as of July 2023) shows Trump and Biden in a close race, with slight leads alternating between them. - Predicting a specific lead range for a specific date over a year in advance is extremely difficult and subject to many variables. - While it's possible for Trump to have a lead in this range, the specificity of the condition makes it relatively unlikely. 2. Vivek Ramaswamy being the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: - Vivek Ramaswamy is a relatively new face in national politics and is considered a long-shot candidate for the Republican nomination. - As of mid-2023, polls consistently show Donald Trump as the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, followed by Ron DeSantis. - Other established politicians like Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, and Tim Scott are also in the race and polling higher than Ramaswamy. - The likelihood of Ramaswamy securing the nomination is very low given his current standing and the strength of other candidates. For both of these events to occur simultaneously, we would need two unlikely events to happen together. The probability of this is the product of the individual probabilities, which would be very low. The specific polling condition for Trump is somewhat arbitrary and difficult to predict, but might have a probability around 0.1 to 0.2. The probability of Ramaswamy winning the nomination is even lower, perhaps around 0.01 to 0.05.

Electoral performance: Both parties have faced challenges in recent elections, which might push them to consider alliances to remain competitive. 4. Ideological differences: While both parties are on the right of the political spectrum, there are significant ideological gaps between them, particularly on issues like European integration and immigration. 5. Public perception: An alliance with RN could alienate moderate LR voters and damage the party's reputation as a mainstream conservative force. 6. Time frame: The question specifies a deadline of June 30, 2024, which is relatively close to the potential election date, leaving limited time for negotiations and agreement. 7. Recent trends: There have been some instances of local cooperation between LR and RN, but a national-level alliance would be unprecedented. 8. Party leadership: The current leadership of both parties would need to be open to such an alliance, which is not clearly the case based on recent statements. Given these factors, while it's not impossible for an alliance to form, it seems unlikely. The ideological differences, potential backlash from moderate voters, and the historical separation of these parties present significant obstacles. However, electoral pressures and the changing political landscape in France do provide some possibility for unexpected alliances."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "991ec358-19c6-49da-9518-fbe4152f142e", "title": "Given the Republicans Party of France forms an alliance with the National Rally, will the Prime Minister of France belong to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The Republicans Party of France (Les R\u00e9publicains) forms a political alliance with the National Rally for the 2024 French legislative election.

Current political landscape in France: As of 2023, the current ruling coalition is 'Together' (Ensemble), led by President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party. The main opposition includes the left-wing NUPES alliance (which includes the New Popular Front) and the far-right National Rally. 2. Hypothetical alliance between The Republicans and National Rally: This would be a significant shift in French politics, as The Republicans have traditionally been a center-right party, while the National Rally is far-right. Such an alliance could potentially create a strong right-wing bloc. 3. French political system: In France, the President appoints the Prime Minister, who is usually from the party or coalition with the majority in the National Assembly. If no party has an absolute majority, coalitions are formed. 4. Timing of events: The question assumes this alliance forms before June 30, 2024, and we're looking at the situation on July 30, 2024. This gives only a month for political dynamics to shift after the alliance announcement. 5. Current polls and trends: As of 2023, Macron's coalition has been struggling, while both left-wing and right-wing parties have been gaining ground. However, predicting political outcomes over a year in advance is challenging. Given these factors, here's my analysis: - The alliance between The Republicans and National Rally would likely strengthen the right-wing bloc in French politics. - However, this doesn't guarantee they would win a majority in the National Assembly or that the President would appoint a Prime Minister from this alliance. - The current 'Together' coalition might still maintain power, especially given the short timeframe between the alliance formation and the date in question. - The left-wing coalition (including New Popular Front) could also potentially gain power, though this seems less likely given the right-wing alliance. - There's also a possibility of a different coalition forming that's neither the current 'Together' nor the New Popular Front. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that the Prime Minister on July 30, 2024, would be from a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together. The right-wing alliance increases this probability, but there are many uncertainties and the timeframe is short."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "014fcbe6-a240-4f1d-a876-09bcadaef020", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The Republicans Party of France (Les R\u00e9publicains) forms a political alliance with the National Rally for the 2024 French legislative election (b) The Prime Minister of France belongs to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together on July 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **Yes** if both of the following are true: (a) Before June 30, 2024, an electoral alliance or coalition agreement is officially announced between the Republicans Party (Les R\u00e9publicains) and National Rally (Rassemblement National) for the upcoming French legislative election, according to credible sources.

Recent events, such as Iran's support for Hamas and other militant groups, have further strained this relationship. 2. Israel's past actions: Israel has a history of conducting covert operations and targeted strikes against perceived threats, including those within Iran. These have included assassinations of nuclear scientists and sabotage of nuclear facilities. 3. Time frame: The question gives a relatively short time frame (less than three weeks from the creation date to the resolution date), which reduces the likelihood of such an attack occurring. 4. Escalation risks: A direct attack by Israel within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation, potentially leading to a wider regional conflict. This risk might make Israel hesitant to carry out such an operation. 5. International pressure: The current global focus on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza might discourage Israel from opening another front of tension, as it could lead to international condemnation and potential diplomatic consequences. 6. Iran's defensive capabilities: Iran has been improving its air defense systems and cybersecurity, which could make it more challenging for Israel to carry out a successful attack. 7. Definition of 'attributed to Israel': The question specifies that the attack must be attributed to Israel, which allows for some ambiguity. Israel often maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity regarding its operations. 8. Threshold for casualties: The requirement of at least five deaths sets a specific bar for the attack's impact, which narrows the scope of potential incidents that would qualify. Given these factors, I believe the probability of such an attack occurring is low but not negligible. The short time frame and the potential for severe consequences make it unlikely that Israel would carry out such an operation unless there was an immediate and severe threat perceived.

Joe Biden dropping out (conditional on the attack occurring): If such an attack were to happen, it would likely create a complex international situation. However, it's unlikely that this alone would cause Biden to drop out, especially given his commitment to his re-election campaign. The probability of Biden dropping out due to this specific reason is quite low, perhaps 5-10%. 3.

Israel has a history of covert operations against Iran, including assassinations and sabotage. However, a direct, attributable attack by Israel on Iranian soil causing at least five deaths would be a major escalation. The timeframe is relatively short (less than three weeks from the question's creation date). Such an attack could potentially lead to a wider regional conflict, which Israel might want to avoid.

(b) If Joe Biden drops out, a reliable media outlet covers the story at least 6 hours in advance: As of now, there are no strong indications that Biden intends to drop out of the race. Biden is the incumbent president and the presumptive Democratic nominee. If he were to drop out, it would be a major news story. Major media outlets often have insider sources and might get wind of such a decision before an official announcement.

(a) Chris Christie being the Republican nominee: Chris Christie has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican nomination, but he faces significant challenges. He's polling very low compared to frontrunners like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. Christie's anti-Trump stance, while appealing to some Republicans, alienates him from a large portion of the party base that still strongly supports Trump. Given the current political landscape and polling data, Christie's chances of securing the nomination appear extremely slim. (b) Biden dropping out before July 13, 2024: While there have been concerns about President Biden's age and some calls for him to step aside, he has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. Biden and his team have been actively preparing for the 2024 campaign. Barring any severe health issues or unforeseen circumstances, it seems unlikely that Biden would drop out, especially this close to the election. However, given his age, there is a non-negligible chance of health-related issues arising. Combining these factors: For this question to resolve as YES, both of these unlikely events must occur. The probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities, which in this case would result in an extremely low likelihood. Given Christie's very low chances of securing the nomination (let's generously say 1%) and the relatively low but not insignificant chance of Biden dropping out (perhaps 10%), the combined probability would be even lower than either individual event.

(a) Regarding the Manifold polls: Public opinion polls consistently show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump, while other Democrats perform better against Trump. Manifold is a prediction market platform, and its users might be more informed about political trends than the general public. The 3% threshold is significant and requires a notable shift in preferences. The time frame (until July 6) is relatively short for a major shift in opinion. Given these factors, it's possible but not highly likely that Trump will gain 3% or more against Biden compared to a generic Democrat on Manifold. I'd estimate this part has about a 40% chance of occurring. (b) Regarding Trump testifying at the hush money trial: Trump has a history of avoiding direct testimony in legal proceedings. However, this is a high-profile criminal case, and Trump may see testifying as an opportunity to defend himself publicly. The decision to testify will likely depend on his legal team's strategy and the progress of the trial. There's still time before the resolution date for the trial to progress to a point where Trump might testify. Considering these factors, I'd estimate the probability of Trump testifying at around 50%. For both (a) and (b) to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.40 * 0.50 = 0.20 or 20%.

It's highly unusual for a sitting VP to choose a running mate, as they are typically on the ticket with the incumbent president. 2. Timing: The question states that Kamala will choose before August 7th, 2024. This timing doesn't align with the typical presidential election cycle, where VP picks are usually announced closer to the party conventions. 3. Candidates mentioned: a. Mark Kelly: A Democratic Senator from Arizona, former astronaut, and husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. While he has a strong profile, he's currently serving as a Senator and hasn't been widely discussed as a potential VP candidate. b. Josh Shapiro: The current Governor of Pennsylvania, elected in 2022. He's a rising star in the Democratic Party but hasn't been prominently featured in VP discussions. 4. Lack of credible sources: The question doesn't cite any reputable sources suggesting that Harris is actively considering VP picks or that these two individuals are frontrunners. 5. Constitutional considerations: The 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits electors from casting votes for president and vice president from the same state. While this doesn't strictly prevent Harris from choosing a running mate from California, it would complicate the electoral process. 6. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for a sitting VP to be replaced on the ticket, and there's no indication that Biden intends to do so. Given these factors, it seems highly improbable that Kamala Harris will be choosing a VP pick at all, let alone choosing between Kelly and Shapiro. The premise of the question appears to be based on misinformation or a misunderstanding of the U.S. electoral process. The most likely scenario is that no VP pick will be announced by Harris, which would result in a NO resolution.

Biden's health: As of now (July 2024), there are no public indications of severe health issues that would warrant invoking the 25th Amendment.

While it's possible he could drop out due to unforeseen health issues or political pressure, it's relatively unlikely given his current stance and the lack of a clear Democratic alternative. Probability for this event: ~10% 2. Donald Trump being removed or blocked from any state's primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024: This is a more complex issue. There have been discussions and some legal attempts to use the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running due to his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot. However, as of now, no state has successfully removed him from the ballot on these grounds. While legal challenges are ongoing, it's uncertain whether any will succeed, especially given the potential for appeals and the politically contentious nature of such a move. Probability for this event: ~20% For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.10 * 0.20 = 0.02 or 2%. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent. If one occurs, it might slightly increase the likelihood of the other (e.g., if Trump is removed from ballots, it might reduce pressure on Biden to continue running). This could marginally increase the joint probability."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.004278920001349329, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.001426306667116443, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.12679829909832335, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

(a) Scotland holding an official, sanctioned referendum on independence before May 3, 2024: The likelihood of this happening is very low. Here's why: 1. The UK government has consistently opposed a second Scottish independence referendum. 2. The Supreme Court ruled in November 2022 that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate for a referendum without Westminster's consent. 3.

It's unlikely that Biden would wait until so late in the election cycle to make such a significant announcement. 5. Party support: The Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden, and there are no prominent challengers within the party. 6. Polling and approval ratings: While Biden's approval ratings have fluctuated, they haven't dropped to levels that would typically force an incumbent to step aside. 7. Policy agenda: Biden has ongoing policy initiatives and goals that he likely wants to continue pursuing in a second term. 8. International context: Given global challenges and the need for stability in U.S. leadership, there might be pressure for Biden to continue. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he won't accept the nomination.

(a) Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination: As of now (April 2024), Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. It's highly unusual for an incumbent president to withdraw from seeking re-nomination, especially this late in the election cycle. While Biden's age and approval ratings have been topics of discussion, there's no strong indication that he plans to step aside. The Democratic Party has not shown any significant push to replace him. Therefore, the probability of Biden announcing he won't accept the nomination before July 15, 2024, is very low. Estimated probability for (a): 0.05 (5%) (b) Russia having control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024: Chasiv Yar is a strategically important location in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine. As of April 2024, it's still under Ukrainian control, but it's close to the front lines. The war in Ukraine has been ongoing for over two years, and the front lines have been relatively static in recent months. While Russia has shown renewed offensive capabilities, taking control of Chasiv Yar would require a significant breakthrough. Given the timeframe (about 13 months from now) and the current situation, it's possible but not highly likely that Russia would gain control of this specific location.

This shows continued Kalenjin dominance in both categories. 3. Current top performers: As of 2023, many of the world's top marathon runners are of Kalenjin origin. This includes Eliud Kipchoge (men's world record holder) and Brigid Kosgei (former women's world record holder). 4. Genetic and environmental factors: The Kalenjin people are known for their natural endurance running abilities, attributed to both genetic factors and their high-altitude training environment in Kenya's Rift Valley. 5. Competition: While Kalenjin runners are strong, there are excellent marathon runners from other ethnicities and countries, including Ethiopia, Japan, and European nations. 6. Unpredictability of sports: Olympic performances can be affected by various factors such as weather conditions, injuries, or unexpected breakout performances from other athletes. 7.

Given these factors, I believe there is a strong chance of Kalenjin athletes winning both marathons, but it's not a certainty.

Kalenjin dominance in marathon running: The Kalenjin tribe from Kenya is known for producing exceptional long-distance runners, particularly in marathons. If both the men's and women's marathon winners are of Kalenjin descent, it confirms their continued dominance in this event. 2. Swimming events at the Olympics: Swimming is one of the sports with the most medal events at the Olympics. In Tokyo 2020, there were 35 swimming events (18 for men, 18 for women, and 3 mixed relays). 3. Multiple medal opportunities in swimming: Unlike marathon running, where an athlete typically competes in only one event, swimmers often compete in multiple events, increasing their chances of winning multiple medals. 4. Historical performance: In recent Olympics, swimmers have often been among the top medal winners. For example, Michael Phelps (USA) and Katie Ledecky (USA) have been dominant forces in swimming, winning multiple gold medals in single Olympic Games. 5. Current swimming stars: While we don't know the exact form of swimmers in 2024, there are several talented swimmers who could potentially win multiple gold medals, such as Caeleb Dressel (USA), Emma McKeon (Australia), or emerging talents. 6. Competition from other sports: We should consider potential multiple gold medal winners from other sports like gymnastics, athletics (track and field), or cycling. However, swimming generally offers more opportunities for multiple medals than most other sports. 7. Timing of the question: The question is asked after the marathon events but before the end of the Olympics, suggesting that swimming events (which typically occur earlier in the Olympic schedule) have likely already taken place. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that a swimmer would win the most gold medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The multiple event nature of swimming, combined with the historical precedent of swimmers being top medal winners, makes this a strong possibility. The fact that Kalenjin athletes won both marathon events doesn't significantly impact this likelihood, as marathon runners typically only compete in one event.

They have dominated these events in recent Olympics and other international competitions. However, while their chances are strong, it's not guaranteed they will win both races. Other nations like Ethiopia also have strong contenders. The probability of Kalenjin athletes winning both marathons is high, but not certain - let's estimate it at around 70%. 2. A swimmer winning the most gold medals: Swimming typically offers more opportunities for multiple medals than many other sports due to the variety of events (different strokes, distances, and relays). Historically, swimmers like Michael Phelps have often been the top medal winners at Olympics. However, this is not always the case, and exceptional athletes in other sports (like gymnastics or athletics) can sometimes win the most golds. The probability of a swimmer being the top gold medalist is also high, perhaps around 75%. For both of these events to occur simultaneously, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.70 * 0.75 = 0.525. This calculation suggests that the probability of both events occurring is just over 50%. However, we should also consider that these events are not entirely independent.

Past behavior: OpenAI has temporarily restricted access in some regions (like Italy) due to regulatory concerns but has worked to restore access quickly. Given these factors, it seems more likely than not that ChatGPT will be generally available in the EU on June 30, 2024. OpenAI has demonstrated a commitment to both expansion and regulatory compliance. While there might be new regulations in place by then, OpenAI is likely to work towards meeting these requirements to maintain their market presence in the EU.

However, Inflection is still developing its products and may not be ready for external red-teaming by June 2024. While it's possible they might do this, there's no strong indication that they will.

However, OpenAI has shown a strong interest in complying with regulations and expanding its services globally. The EU's AI Act is expected to be finalized soon, which will provide clearer guidelines for AI companies. OpenAI has already worked to address concerns in specific countries like Italy. Given the importance of the EU market and OpenAI's resources, it's likely they will work to become compliant and available in the EU by June 2024. I'd estimate the probability of this at around 80%.

Fundraising: As a relatively unknown candidate, Suarez would likely struggle to raise the necessary funds to compete in a national campaign against well-established politicians with large donor networks. 5. Experience: While Suarez has executive experience as a mayor, he lacks national political experience, which could be seen as a disadvantage in a presidential race. 6. Time: With the Republican National Convention typically held in the summer before the election (likely July or August 2024), there is limited time for Suarez to build a national profile and campaign infrastructure. 7.

This shows a moderate success rate in recent years. 2. Recent results: Malta qualified for the Grand Final in 2021 and 2023, but failed to qualify in 2022. Their most recent performance (2023) saw them finish 11th in the Grand Final, which is a strong result. 3. Selection process: Malta typically uses a national final or internal selection to choose their entry. The quality of their selection process can impact their chances. 4. Eurovision trends: The contest has seen a shift towards more modern, radio-friendly pop songs in recent years. Malta's ability to adapt to these trends could affect their qualification chances. 5. Semi-final draw: The distribution of countries in each semi-final can impact qualification chances. This information is not available yet for 2024. 6. Voting patterns: Malta often receives support from countries like Italy and Australia due to diaspora voting, which can help in qualification. 7.

Malta's chances are less certain due to their recent failures to qualify, but they have shown the ability to reach the final in the past. For both countries to qualify, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. If we estimate Serbia's chances at around 80% (0.8) based on their strong track record, and Malta's at a more conservative 50% (0.5) due to recent performances, the combined probability would be 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 or 40%.

Historical performance: The SENSEX has shown strong growth over the past decades. In recent years, it has sometimes achieved annual growth rates exceeding 15%. However, such high growth rates are not consistent and often followed by corrections. 3. Economic factors: India's economy is one of the fastest-growing major economies globally. Continued economic growth, foreign investments, and government policies supportive of the stock market could drive the SENSEX higher. 4. Global economic conditions: The global economic outlook for 2024 is uncertain due to factors like inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. These could impact the Indian stock market positively or negatively. 5. Specific range: The question asks for a very specific range (75,000-76,000), which is a narrow window. Even if the SENSEX grows significantly, the probability of it landing in this exact range is relatively low. 6. Time until resolution: There's about a year until the resolution date, which provides time for significant market movements, but also increases uncertainty. 7.

As of July 2024, the election will be just a few months away, and polls tend to become more accurate closer to the election. However, national polling averages can fluctuate, and a lead of 2-3 points is not uncommon in a close race. Given the polarized nature of US politics, a close race is quite possible.

Predicting volatility a year in advance is challenging, as many unforeseen events can occur. However, 2024 is an election year in the US, which often brings increased market uncertainty. Additionally, there are ongoing global economic challenges and geopolitical tensions that could contribute to higher volatility. Given these factors, there's a reasonable chance of higher volatility, perhaps around 40-45%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. Even if we take the higher estimates for each (25% for part a and 45% for part b), the combined probability would be 0.25 * 0.45 = 0.1125 or about 11.25%.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would drop out before July 20 if Tucker Carlson were the Republican nominee. The premise itself (Carlson as the nominee) is improbable, and even if it occurred, it would not likely cause Biden to exit the race. Biden and the Democratic Party would likely see Carlson as a beatable opponent and would be motivated to stay in the race.

He is not currently a politician and has no experience in elected office. The Republican field already has several established politicians like Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and others who have declared their candidacy or are expected to do so. The likelihood of the Republican Party choosing a media personality with no political experience over established politicians is very low. Probability for (a): Approximately 0.01 (1%) (b) Biden dropping out before July 20: Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls from within the Democratic Party for new leadership, it is highly unusual for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election race, especially this early in the process. Biden has consistently stated his intention to run, and his team is actively preparing for the campaign. Barring any severe health issues or unforeseen circumstances, it's unlikely he would drop out before July 20. Probability for (b): Approximately 0.05 (5%) For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.01 * 0.05 = 0.0005 (0.05%) This extremely low probability reflects the unlikelihood of both these unusual events occurring simultaneously.

Reynolds stars as Deadpool, which could potentially lead to a cameo opportunity. 2. Recent rumors and speculation: There have been rumors circulating about Swift potentially playing Dazzler, a mutant character in the X-Men universe. This speculation has gained traction among fans and media outlets. 3. Swift's acting experience: While primarily known as a musician, Swift has acted in films before, including 'Valentine's Day,' 'The Giver,' and most recently, 'Amsterdam.' This shows she's open to acting roles. 4. Marvel's history of surprise cameos: The Marvel Cinematic Universe is known for including unexpected cameos and Easter eggs in their films, which could make a Swift appearance more likely. 5. Swift's popularity and marketing potential: Including a global superstar like Swift, even in a small role, could generate significant buzz and potentially attract a broader audience to the film. 6. Time until resolution: With the resolution date set for July 24, 2024, there's still ample time for Swift to be cast or for a cameo to be arranged, even if it's not currently planned. 7. Secrecy in Marvel productions: Marvel is known for keeping details of their films under wraps, so even if Swift is involved, it might not be publicly known until closer to the release date. However, we should also consider some counterpoints: 1. Swift's busy schedule: She is currently on her highly successful Eras Tour, which could limit her availability for film projects. 2. Lack of official confirmation: As of now, there's no official confirmation from Marvel, the filmmakers, or Swift herself about her involvement in the film. 3. Possibility of over-speculation: Fans and media often speculate about potential cameos, many of which don't materialize.

Franchise popularity: Both Deadpool and Wolverine are extremely popular characters in the Marvel universe. Their combination in a single film is likely to generate significant buzz and attract fans of both characters. 2. Previous performance: 'Deadpool' (2016) had a strong opening of $132,434,639, while 'The Wolverine' (2013) opened at $53,113,752. The fact that we're comparing to their combined opening suggests there's already a high bar set. 3. Taylor Swift's involvement: Her cameo, even if minor, could attract a broader audience beyond typical superhero movie fans. Swift has a massive and dedicated fanbase that might turn out just to see her brief appearance. 4. Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) integration: With Disney's acquisition of Fox, this movie is likely to be part of the MCU, which could further boost its appeal to a wider audience. 5. Post-pandemic box office recovery: By 2024, the movie industry is likely to have further recovered from the pandemic's impact, potentially leading to higher box office numbers in general. 6. Inflation: The target number ($185,548,391) is based on 2013 and 2016 figures. Ticket prices are likely to be higher in 2024, making it easier to reach higher gross numbers. 7. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's star power: Both actors are hugely popular and their on-screen chemistry and off-screen friendship could be a major draw. 8. Marketing potential: The combination of these characters, plus Swift's cameo, gives the studio numerous marketing angles to promote the film widely. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will surpass the combined opening weekend box office of its predecessors. The combination of beloved characters, star power, potential MCU integration, and the added draw of Taylor Swift makes for a potent mix that could drive significant opening weekend attendance. However, there are some potential risks to consider: 1. Superhero fatigue: There's always a possibility that audiences might be experiencing superhero movie fatigue by 2024. 2.

(a) Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024: This is an extremely rare occurrence in U.S. history. The 25th Amendment has never been invoked in this manner. While there have been concerns about Biden's age and occasional gaffes, there's no concrete evidence of incapacitation. The administration and Biden's party would be highly resistant to such a move. The mention of a GOP lawmaker asking for this is more likely political posturing than a serious threat. The probability of this happening is very low. (b) Joe Biden dying before July 26th, 2024: Biden is currently 80 years old (born November 20, 1942). While his age puts him at higher risk of health issues, he has access to excellent healthcare and appears to be in relatively good health for his age. The average life expectancy for an 80-year-old American male is about 8 more years. The probability of him dying in the next year (until July 2024) is higher than average due to his age, but still relatively low. For both events to occur, we need (a) AND (b) to happen, which means multiplying their individual probabilities.

Incumbent advantage: Historically, sitting presidents rarely decline to run for a second term unless facing significant health issues or extreme unpopularity. Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in U.S. history. There have been concerns about his age and mental acuity, which could potentially lead to a decision not to run. 3. Current statements and actions: As of now (July 2023), Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election and has already launched his 2024 campaign. 4. Party support: The Democratic Party leadership has largely rallied behind Biden, and there's no strong push from within the party for him to step aside. 5. Polling and approval ratings: While Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, they're not at a level that would typically force an incumbent out of the race. 6. Lack of strong Democratic alternatives: There's no clear successor or alternative candidate who has emerged as a strong contender to replace Biden. 7. Time frame: The question asks about an announcement before July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely that a sitting president would wait until so late in the process to announce they're not running. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden will announce he's not accepting the nomination before July 15, 2024. While concerns about his age and health are real, the combination of incumbent advantage, his current campaign activities, party support, and the late date specified in the question all point towards him continuing his re-election bid.

The timeframe for potential action: The period between Biden's hypothetical announcement (before July 15, 2024) and the resolution date (August 3, 2024) is very short - less than three weeks.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden has consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of the race, especially this late in the election cycle.

Campaign activities: Both candidates are likely to be actively campaigning during this period, which could influence polls slightly. 5. Potential external factors: Any major news events, economic shifts, or international incidents could impact the polls, but these are unpredictable. 6. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points, which means small changes might not be statistically significant. Given that Trump is already leading by 2.4 points, for the question to resolve as YES, his lead would need to increase by at least 0.6 points (to reach >2) but not by more than 1.6 points (to stay \u22644). This is certainly possible, as it falls within a reasonable range of poll movement over a 10-day period. However, there are also possibilities that could lead to a NO resolution: - Trump's lead could remain stable or increase by less than 0.6 points. - Trump's lead could increase by more than 1.6 points. - Biden could gain ground, reducing Trump's lead or even overtaking him. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of the question resolving as YES, but it's not highly probable. The range for a YES resolution is relatively narrow (between 2 and 4 points), which limits the likelihood somewhat."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "3db17dcf-df99-4b4d-a6ba-73e2075cc488", "title": "Given Trump's lead over Biden is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, will the linked market get at least 377 traders by end of July 15?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: On July 15, 2024, Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 according to 538's national polling average.

Trump currently has a slight lead in some polls, but this can change. A lead between 2 and 4 points is a relatively narrow range, making it less likely.

However, there are also factors that reduce the likelihood: - The legal hurdles for such a disqualification are significant, and courts may be hesitant to set such a precedent. - Trump has substantial political support, which could make states reluctant to take such a drastic step. - The question specifically asks about primary ballots, which might have different rules than general election ballots.

Russian control of Chasiv Yar on June 1, 2024: Chasiv Yar is a strategically important town in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine, close to Bakhmut. As of September 2023, it is under Ukrainian control, but Russian forces have been attempting to advance in this direction. However, predicting the state of control nearly a year in advance is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the conflict. The Ukrainian forces have shown resilience in defending their territory, but Russia has also demonstrated persistence in its offensive operations.

Donald Trump being removed or blocked from primary election ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: This is a highly contentious and unprecedented legal issue. Several legal scholars have argued that Trump's actions related to the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot could potentially disqualify him under the 14th Amendment. Some states, like Colorado, have already seen attempts to remove Trump from the ballot, though these have not yet succeeded. The issue is likely to face significant legal challenges and may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. Given the legal and political complexities, I would estimate a lower probability of this occurring by July 15, 2024, at around 20%.

Incumbent disadvantage: Biden is the incumbent president, and historically, incumbent approval ratings tend to correlate with election performance. Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low, which could give Trump an advantage. 7. Legal issues: Trump is facing several legal challenges, which could potentially impact his polling numbers positively or negatively, depending on how they unfold. 8. Narrow range: The question asks specifically about a lead between 2 and 3 points, which is a relatively narrow range. Given these factors, it's certainly possible that Trump could have a lead in this range, but it's a specific outcome among many possibilities.

The current political landscape: As of now (2023), Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential election. 3. Historical precedent: It's rare for a party to change its nominee when an incumbent or former president is running and performing well in polls. 4.

Time until the nomination: The Republican nominee is typically decided well before July 2024, usually by spring or early summer of the election year. Given these factors, if Trump is leading Biden by 2-3 points in July 2024, it's highly likely that he would already be the Republican nominee. The strong polling would indicate that the Republican party had made the right choice in nominating him (assuming he was nominated earlier in the year, as is typical). The only scenario where this might not be the case is if some extraordinary event occurred after the nomination but before July 15, 2024, causing Trump to step down and be replaced by another family member.

The specific range (2-3 point lead) is quite narrow, making it less likely to occur. Polling averages tend to fluctuate, and predicting a specific range over a year in advance is challenging.

Such a drastic drop would likely indicate a broader economic problem. 2. Relationship between stock market and inflation: Generally, a severe stock market decline can be associated with economic uncertainty or a recession. In recessionary periods, inflation often decreases due to reduced consumer spending and economic activity. 3. Core CPI trends: The Core CPI (Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy) is a key measure of inflation. In recent years, the US has experienced higher than normal inflation, but efforts by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation have been ongoing. 4. Federal Reserve policies: If Nvidia's stock price were to fall so dramatically, it might prompt the Federal Reserve to take more aggressive action to stimulate the economy, which could potentially lead to increased inflation. 5.

This gives little time for economic conditions to significantly change following a hypothetical Nvidia stock crash. 6. Historical context: A month-over-month increase of more than 0.1% in Core CPI is not uncommon, even in periods of relatively stable inflation. Given these factors, if Nvidia's stock were to crash so severely, it would likely indicate significant economic troubles. However, the immediate impact on July's Core CPI might be limited due to the short time frame. The crash itself wouldn't directly cause inflation, but it could be symptomatic of broader economic issues that might influence inflation. That said, a 0.1% month-over-month increase in Core CPI is a relatively low bar. Even in times of economic uncertainty, it's not uncommon to see Core CPI increases of this magnitude or greater. Considering all these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that the Core CPI would increase by more than 0.1% in July, even if Nvidia's stock crashed.

He maintains a strong base of supporters within the party. 2. The relationship between market volatility and political uncertainty: The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) is a measure of market expectations of near-term volatility. Higher volatility often correlates with increased economic or political uncertainty. If the index is higher in July 2024 compared to July 2023, it could indicate a more uncertain political or economic environment. 3. Potential impact of market volatility on Trump's nomination: Increased market volatility could work in Trump's favor, as he often positions himself as a strong leader during times of uncertainty. His supporters might view him as better equipped to handle economic challenges. 4. Other factors affecting Trump's nomination: - Legal challenges: Trump is currently facing several legal issues, which could impact his eligibility or popularity. - Competition within the Republican Party: Other strong candidates might emerge, potentially challenging Trump's position. - Party unity: The Republican establishment might prefer a less controversial candidate to unite the party. 5. Time frame: By July 2024, the Republican nominee will likely have been decided or be very close to being finalized, as the Republican National Convention typically occurs in July or August of election years. Given these factors, I believe there's a strong possibility that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election, especially if market volatility is higher.

The probability of death occurring in such a brief period is generally low for someone not suffering from a terminal illness. 5.

It would be highly unusual and politically disruptive for an incumbent president to suddenly withdraw from the race, especially this close to the election. The likelihood of this happening is very low. 2. Another Democratic party presidential debate occurring: Given that Biden is the presumptive nominee and there are no significant challengers at this time, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has not scheduled any debates. Debates typically occur when there is a competitive primary race, which is not the case for the 2024 Democratic nomination. The only scenario where this might change is if Biden were to withdraw, which, as discussed, is unlikely. For this question to resolve as YES, both of these unlikely events must occur. The probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities, which would make the combined probability even lower. Even if Biden were to unexpectedly withdraw (which is already very unlikely), organizing a debate on such short notice before the convention would be challenging. The time between July 15, 2024, and the typical timing of the Democratic National Convention (usually in August) is very short for setting up a debate process. Given these factors, the probability of both events occurring is extremely low."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1522996021561092, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Recent trend: The ratings for Season 2 have been volatile, with the most recent episode (E5) receiving the lowest rating of the series at 7.6.

Considering these factors, there's a reasonable chance that S2E7 could score above 8.5, especially if it contains major plot developments or impressive sequences.

Given that polling averages tend to be relatively stable over short periods, especially when there are no major events, it's reasonably likely that Trump's lead will remain within this narrow range. However, there's also a significant chance it could move outside this range in either direction. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 40%. (b) Joe Biden having an in-person interview/conversation on camera for 45+ minutes before the end of July 2024: This condition seems more challenging. The question notes that Biden's recent interviews have been shorter than the required 45 minutes. Given that it's an election year, Biden might be more inclined to do longer interviews to reach voters. However, his team might also be cautious about extended unscripted appearances. The time frame (until the end of July) provides some opportunity, but it's not extensive. I'd estimate the probability of this condition being met at around 30%. For both conditions to be met, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.40 * 0.30 = 0.12 or 12%. This calculation assumes the events are independent, which is a reasonable assumption given that polling numbers and interview scheduling decisions are likely not closely related."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.006204839925416137, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Ongoing investigation: The ICC has already opened an investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories, which includes actions by both Israeli and Palestinian actors. 3. Current conflict: The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict since October 2023 has resulted in significant civilian casualties in Gaza, which has drawn international criticism and calls for investigation into potential war crimes. 4.

However, given the ongoing conflict in Gaza and international pressure, there's a non-negligible chance of warrants being issued. 2. Impact of arrest warrants on terrorist motivations: If arrest warrants are issued, it could inflame tensions between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian groups globally, potentially increasing the risk of terrorist activities. 3. France as a target: France has a history of being targeted by terrorist attacks and has a significant Jewish and Muslim population. The Olympics would provide a high-profile target for potential attackers. 4.

The recent conflict in Gaza has increased international scrutiny on Israel's actions. However, issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli officials is a significant step that would face substantial political pressure. The ICC moves slowly in such high-profile cases.

Donald Trump's legal situation: Trump is currently facing multiple legal challenges, including the hush money case involving Stormy Daniels.

Trump's typical approach to legal matters: Historically, Trump has been reluctant to testify in legal proceedings, often fighting subpoenas and attempting to delay or avoid appearing in court. He tends to view testifying as risky and prefers to communicate through his lawyers or public statements. 4. Impact of not being the nominee: If Trump is not the nominee (which is the condition in this scenario), he might be more inclined to testify as the political stakes would be lower. He wouldn't need to worry about how his testimony might affect his campaign. 5.

Current standing: As of now, Tim Scott has not officially announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential race. He has, however, formed an exploratory committee, which is often a precursor to a formal announcement. 2. Competition: The Republican field is expected to be crowded, with several high-profile candidates already announced or likely to run. This includes former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and others. These candidates currently have higher name recognition and polling numbers than Scott. 3. Fundraising: While Scott has proven to be a strong fundraiser for his Senate campaigns, it's unclear how he would fare in a presidential primary against well-funded opponents like Trump and DeSantis. 4. Political experience: Scott has served as a U.S. Senator since 2013 and has gained national attention for his work on police reform and economic opportunity zones. However, he lacks executive experience compared to some of his potential rivals. 5. Demographics: As the only Black Republican in the Senate, Scott could potentially broaden the party's appeal. However, it's uncertain how much this would influence primary voters. 6. Policy positions: Scott is generally aligned with mainstream Republican positions, which could help him avoid alienating large segments of the party. However, this also means he may struggle to differentiate himself from other candidates. 7. Time until convention: The Republican National Convention is still more than a year away, leaving ample time for the political landscape to shift dramatically. Given these factors, while Tim Scott is a respected figure within the Republican Party, he currently faces significant challenges in securing the nomination. He lacks the name recognition and polling numbers of frontrunners like Trump and DeSantis, and he hasn't yet officially entered the race. The field is likely to be crowded, further reducing his chances. However, it's important to note that political fortunes can change rapidly, and Scott does have some unique attributes that could potentially appeal to Republican primary voters. Still, based on the current political landscape, his chances of securing the nomination appear to be relatively low."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "0d9b5590-e478-478e-85c1-7623cb6422ce", "title": "If Tim Scott is the Republican nominee, will 538 project Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Tim Scott is selected by the Republican National Convention as the nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Let's break it down: 1. Tim Scott becoming the Republican nominee: Tim Scott is currently a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, his chances of winning the nomination appear to be quite low for several reasons: a) He is not as well-known nationally as other candidates like Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis. b) Current polling shows him significantly behind frontrunners like Trump and DeSantis. c) He lacks the fundraising power and established base of support that some other candidates have. While it's not impossible for Scott to win the nomination, it would require a significant shift in the political landscape or unforeseen events that dramatically alter the race. 2. FiveThirtyEight projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This condition is more plausible, as Biden is the incumbent president and historically, incumbents often have an advantage. However, several factors make this less certain: a) Biden's approval ratings have been relatively low throughout his presidency. b) Economic concerns and other issues could impact his popularity. c) The Republican nominee and overall political climate will greatly influence projections. If a strong Republican candidate emerges (which is unlikely to be Tim Scott based on current information), they might be favored over Biden.

Historical trends: In recent elections, polls have tended to tighten as Election Day approaches. However, this question is about mid-July, which is still several months before the election. 2. Current polling: As of now (2023), polls have shown a close race between Trump and Biden, with some variation depending on the pollster and timing. 3. Economic factors: The state of the economy in mid-2024 will likely play a significant role in voter preferences. 4.

Time frame: The question is asked very close to the start of the Olympics (created on July 28, 2024, with the Olympics starting shortly after), so we have a good idea of the participating athletes and their current form. 6. Competition format: The knockout format of Olympic tennis means that strong players are likely to progress far in multiple events. Given these factors, it seems highly likely that at least one athlete will win more than one medal in tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Top players often compete in both singles and doubles events, and many are skilled enough to be competitive in both. The historical precedent also supports this likelihood. However, we must also consider potential obstacles: 1. Upsets can happen, especially in a high-pressure environment like the Olympics. 2. Injuries or fatigue could prevent a player from performing well across multiple events. 3. The level of competition is extremely high, making it challenging to win multiple medals. Despite these potential obstacles, the opportunity to compete in multiple events and the historical precedent of players winning multiple medals make it more likely than not that at least one athlete will achieve this feat."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "32d74469-c7fc-4a2f-b133-e75a81bbe845", "title": "Given an athlete wins more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics, will the same nation win more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics?", "body": "This question explores the scenario where at least one athlete wins two or more medals in tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

In recent Olympics, we've seen players like Belinda Bencic (2020 Tokyo) and Andy Murray (2016 Rio) win multiple tennis medals.

Tucker Carlson as the Republican nominee: Tucker Carlson is a popular conservative media figure, but he has not announced any intention to run for president. He has no political experience as an elected official, which is typically a prerequisite for a major party nomination. The current frontrunners for the Republican nomination are Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and other established political figures. While surprises can happen in politics, it's extremely improbable that the Republican Party would nominate someone who hasn't even declared candidacy or shown interest in running. 2. Trump's lead over Biden between 3 and 4 points on July 15, 2024: This condition is very specific and narrow. While it's possible that Trump (or another Republican candidate) could be leading Biden in polls, the exact margin of 3-4 points on a specific date is a precise requirement. Polling averages can fluctuate widely, especially in the months leading up to an election. Additionally, this condition assumes that both Trump and Biden will be their respective party's nominees, which is not guaranteed. The combination of these two unlikely events makes the overall probability extremely low. The first condition (Carlson as nominee) is already highly improbable, and the second condition (specific polling margin on a specific date) adds another layer of improbability. Probability: 0.0001 (or 0.01%) This extremely low probability reflects the near-impossibility of both conditions being met simultaneously.

Any recession or significant economic downturn could hurt Biden's chances. 4. Political developments: Ongoing investigations into Trump, potential legal issues, or any major policy successes or failures for the Biden administration could sway public opinion. 5.

International events: Major international crises or conflicts could impact voter perceptions of leadership and foreign policy competence. 7. Third-party candidates: The presence and popularity of third-party candidates could affect the polling gap between Trump and Biden. 8.

Time frame: The question asks about the situation on July 30, 2024, which is only a month after the hypothetical alliance forms. This is a relatively short time for major political changes to occur. Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that the Prime Minister will still belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024. Here's why: - The time frame is quite short for a complete government overhaul. - Even if the new alliance puts pressure on the government, it would take time for this to translate into a change of Prime Minister. - Without early elections (which are not guaranteed), the current parliamentary majority would likely remain in place. - The Together coalition might adjust its strategy to counter the new alliance, potentially strengthening its position.

It would require a significant and sudden decline in Biden's health or cognitive abilities, which is possible but not highly probable given his current condition. 2. Timing: The scenario requires this to happen before August 2024, which is during the peak of the election season. This timing makes it even more unlikely, as there would be enormous political pressure to avoid such a drastic measure close to the election. 3. Biden's response: If such an unprecedented event were to occur, it would create a major political crisis. Biden would likely contest the declaration, as the 25th Amendment allows. This process could take time, potentially extending beyond July 15, 2024. 4. Political considerations: Even if declared incapacitated, Biden and his team might be reluctant to immediately announce he won't accept the nomination.

Nate Silver's model: Nate Silver is known for his data-driven approach and tends to be conservative in making dramatic changes to his model without substantial new information. 4. Current political climate: There are no major events scheduled in the next week that would likely cause a dramatic shift in the political landscape. 5. Time frame: The resolution date is only about a week from the creation date, which is a very short period for significant changes in electoral predictions. 6. Specific threshold: The question asks if Harris's probability will be >46.6%, which is quite high considering she's not currently a candidate. 7. Historical precedent: It's extremely rare for a sitting Vice President to challenge or replace the incumbent President of their own party for the nomination, especially this close to an election. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Kamala Harris's odds of winning the presidency would increase to over 46.6% in Nate Silver's model within a week. For this to happen, there would need to be a major, unexpected political event that dramatically changes the landscape of the 2024 election.

This could indicate a shift in public opinion or other factors favoring Harris. 3.

Given these factors, it's unlikely that Biden would suddenly announce he won't accept the nomination, even if Harris's odds improve. Here's why: 1. Incumbency advantage: Biden still holds the power of incumbency, which is traditionally seen as a strong position. 2. Late timing: July 15 is very close to the convention, making a last-minute change disruptive to the party. 3. Biden's commitment: He has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. 4. Party stability: Such a late change could be seen as destabilizing for the Democratic Party. 5. Harris's role: As VP, her improved odds might be seen as a positive for the Biden-Harris ticket rather than a reason for Biden to step aside. However, there are factors that slightly increase the probability: 1. Biden's age and potential health concerns could become more pressing. 2. A significant improvement in Harris's odds might indicate she's a stronger candidate. 3. Party pressure could mount if they believe Harris has a better chance of winning.

He has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election. For him to suddenly announce he won't accept the nomination would be a major political upheaval. Such decisions are typically made much earlier in the election cycle to allow the party to prepare an alternative candidate.

Potential female candidates: While there are several prominent female Democrats who could potentially run, such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Senator Elizabeth Warren, or Governor Gretchen Whitmer, none have announced intentions to challenge Biden for the nomination. 3. Historical precedent: The Democratic Party has never nominated a woman for president in its history, with Hillary Clinton in 2016 being the closest to achieving this milestone. 4. Time frame: The resolution date is set for August 6, 2024, which aligns with the typical timing of the Democratic National Convention. This leaves little time for unexpected changes in the nomination process. 5. Party unity: The Democratic Party is likely to prioritize unity and avoid a contentious primary battle that could weaken their chances in the general election. 6. Biden's age and health: While Biden's age (he would be 82 at the start of a second term) could be a factor, he has maintained that he intends to run for re-election. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that the Democratic Party will nominate a woman for the 2024 presidential election. The probability of this occurring is low, primarily due to Biden's incumbent status and the lack of any significant challenge from female candidates at this time. However, we must account for unforeseen circumstances, such as a sudden health issue for Biden or a major political scandal that could force him to withdraw. While these scenarios are unlikely, they are not impossible."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "cff7c477-6208-4306-a466-19d734b2c19c", "title": "Given the 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee is a Woman, will the same nation win more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: The Democratic delegates select a female presidential nominee for the 2024 election.\n\nThen, consider the following: Will the same National Olympic Committee (NOC) win more than one women's team sport at the 2024 Olympics?

Short time frame: The question is asked close to the Olympics (about a month before), which means current form and rankings are likely to be indicative of performance. 6. US focus on women's sports: The US has a strong system for developing women athletes, partly due to Title IX legislation, which could contribute to continued success across multiple sports.

The US has a strong chance in basketball (both formats), volleyball, and water polo. Even if they don't win all of these, winning two out of these four seems quite probable.

The role of the Vice President: In this scenario, the Vice President (Kamala Harris) would become Acting President. This could potentially split Democratic support or create confusion among voters. 4.

Democratic Party response: The party might scramble to put forward an alternative candidate, which could further complicate projections. 8. Trump's position: Trump's standing in the polls and public opinion at the time would also play a crucial role. Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would be projected as the favorite in this scenario. The declaration of incapacitation would be a major blow to his campaign, likely causing a significant drop in his polling numbers and overall support. Even if the Democratic Party rallied behind the Vice President or another candidate, the confusion and disruption caused by such an event would likely benefit the opposing party (Republicans and Trump) in the short term. FiveThirtyEight's projections, which are based on various data points and models, would likely reflect this shift. The unprecedented nature of the situation might introduce some uncertainty into their models, but it's hard to imagine a scenario where Biden remains the favorite after being declared incapacitated.

The 25th Amendment has never been invoked for this purpose in U.S. history. While Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history, there have been no serious indications of incapacity that would warrant such an extreme measure. His administration and party have consistently supported his leadership. The probability of this happening is very low. 2. 538 projecting Biden as the favorite on July 19, 2024: This is more plausible. As the incumbent president, Biden has certain advantages in the election. However, his approval ratings have been relatively low, and there's significant uncertainty about the 2024 election. It's possible that 538 could project Biden as the favorite, but it's far from certain. For both events to occur, we need the extremely unlikely event of Biden being declared incapacitated AND 538 still projecting him as the favorite for the election. This combination is even less likely than either event individually. If Biden were to be declared incapacitated, it would likely have a significant negative impact on his election prospects. It would be highly improbable for 538 to still project him as the favorite after such a major event.

Time frame: The window for this scenario to unfold is relatively short (about 5 days from the question's creation to the resolution date). 3. Early nomination plan: The question assumes there is a plan to virtually nominate Biden early. Such plans can be controversial, especially if they're perceived as circumventing the normal democratic process. 4. Party unity: Democrats generally try to present a united front, especially in election years. Public opposition to the party's presumptive nominee would be unusual. 5. Potential concerns: Some Democrats might have concerns about Biden's age or his ability to defeat the Republican nominee. However, these concerns have not led to widespread public opposition so far. 6. Number of signatories required: 20 is a significant number of elected officials to publicly oppose their party's presumptive nominee. It's not impossible, but it would represent a major break in party unity. 7. Conditional nature: The question is conditional on Biden still being president, which is likely but not certain.

Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that 20 or more Democratic House members or Senators would publicly sign a letter opposing an early nomination plan for Biden.

Incumbent advantage: Typically, incumbent presidents are renominated by their party without much contest. However, poor polling performance could lead to internal party dissent. 3. Biden's age and performance: By 2024, Biden will be 81 years old. If his performance is perceived as weak (as suggested by the polling), there might be increased pressure for an alternative candidate. 4.

Current polling trends would be highly indicative of the situation on July 15. However, without specific current polling data, we must rely on general trends and historical patterns: 1. Presidential races often tighten as Election Day approaches. 2. Incumbent presidents (in this case, Biden) often face challenges in polling, especially if the economy or other major issues are not favorable. 3. Trump, as a former president, has high name recognition and a dedicated base. Given these factors, it's plausible that Trump could have a lead, but the specific range of 2-4 points is quite narrow.

The last truly brokered convention for Democrats was in 1952. Several factors make a brokered convention unlikely: 1. The Democratic Party typically rallies around a presumptive nominee well before the convention. 2. As the incumbent, Biden would be the presumptive nominee unless he chooses not to run or faces significant challenges. 3. The party usually works to avoid the appearance of disunity that a brokered convention would suggest. Given these factors, I'd estimate the probability of a Democratic brokered convention at around 5-10%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities. Even taking the higher estimates, we get: 0.25 * 0.10 = 0.025 or 2.5%. This is likely an overestimate, as the events are not entirely independent.

It would be highly unusual for sitting senators from the same party to publicly call for the incumbent president to drop out, especially in such large numbers (10 or more). The deadline of July 20 is also relatively soon, leaving little time for such a dramatic shift in party dynamics. Given these factors, the probability of both events occurring is extremely low. The chance of Suarez winning the nomination is already very small, and the likelihood of 10+ Democratic Senators calling for Biden to drop out is also very low. The probability of both these unlikely events occurring together is even smaller."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 1.7100488522423722e-05, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 5.700162840807908e-06, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0030070462472850377, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

There have been no official announcements about their return as of the creation date of this question (April 12, 2024). 2. Historical performance: When Luxembourg was active in Eurovision (1956-1993), they had a strong track record, winning 5 times and finishing in the top 5 on 15 occasions. However, this historical success may not be directly relevant after such a long absence. 3. Current music scene: Luxembourg's modern music industry is relatively small compared to other European countries, which could impact their ability to produce a competitive entry. 4. Financial considerations: Eurovision participation can be expensive, and Luxembourg is a small country. This might be a factor in their decision to participate and the resources they can allocate if they do. 5. Qualification process: If Luxembourg does participate, they would likely need to go through a semi-final round. The qualification rate from semi-finals is typically around 50% (10 out of 20 countries usually qualify from each semi-final). 6. Lack of recent experience: After a 30-year absence, Luxembourg would be at a disadvantage in terms of recent Eurovision experience and established voting alliances. 7. Time frame: The resolution date (May 7, 2024) suggests that the semi-finals for Eurovision 2024 would occur around this time. However, as of the question creation date, there's no indication of Luxembourg's participation. Given these factors, the probability of Luxembourg qualifying for the Grand Final in Eurovision 2024 is very low.

Eurovision voting patterns: There isn't a strong voting alliance between Norway and Switzerland, so Norway's qualification doesn't directly impact Switzerland's chances. 3. Semi-final allocation: The countries are usually divided into two semi-finals. If Norway and Switzerland are in different semi-finals, their performances won't directly compete against each other. 4.

The potential impact of this scenario on the approval of the Pandemic Agreement at the May 2024 World Health Assembly (WHA). 3. The current status and support for the Pandemic Agreement. 4. The relationship between the European Parliament and the World Health Assembly. Let's break it down: 1. The ID group is a right-wing, Eurosceptic political group in the European Parliament. If they were to hold the most seats after the 2024 elections, it would represent a significant shift in European politics towards more nationalist and anti-EU sentiment. 2. The ID group is generally skeptical of international agreements and tends to prioritize national sovereignty. They would likely be opposed to a global Pandemic Agreement that could potentially limit national autonomy in health-related matters. 3. However, the European Parliament does not directly vote on or approve World Health Organization (WHO) agreements. The WHA is the decision-making body of the WHO, composed of representatives from all WHO member states, not just European countries. 4. The Pandemic Agreement, also known as the 'pandemic treaty,' is currently being negotiated by WHO member states. Its goal is to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response globally. 5. While European countries are influential in the WHO, they do not have a controlling majority. The agreement would need broad support from countries worldwide to be approved. 6. Even if the ID group gains significant power in the European Parliament, individual EU member states would still have their own representatives at the WHA, who may not necessarily align with the ID group's views. 7. The timeline is tight - the European Parliament elections are typically held in May, and the WHA is also in May. The potential influence of a newly elected parliament on member states' positions at the WHA would be limited due to this short timeframe. 8. There is currently strong support for a pandemic agreement among many countries, including from the current EU leadership. This momentum might be difficult to reverse quickly, even with a shift in European Parliament composition. Given these factors, while an ID group majority in the European Parliament could potentially influence some European countries' positions, it's unlikely to completely derail the Pandemic Agreement if there is broad global support. However, it could make approval more challenging or lead to a watered-down version of the agreement. The question assumes two conditions that are not necessarily related, making it difficult to establish a direct causal link.

Joe Biden's current stance: As of now, Joe Biden has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. He has not shown any signs of reconsidering this decision. 3. Biden's age and health: Biden would be 82 at the start of a second term, which has raised concerns about his ability to serve. However, he has maintained that he is fit for office. 4. Democratic Party dynamics: The Democratic Party has largely rallied behind Biden as the incumbent president. There's no significant push from within the party for him to step aside. 5. Strategic considerations: If Will Hurd were to become the Republican nominee (which is highly unlikely), it might actually strengthen Biden's position. Hurd is seen as a moderate Republican, which could potentially make him more competitive in a general election. However, this very moderation might also make him less threatening to Biden's re-election prospects compared to more polarizing candidates. 6. Timing: The question specifies a deadline of July 15, 2024, which is very close to the Democratic National Convention (typically held in August). It's unlikely that Biden would wait until so late in the process to make such a significant announcement if he were planning to step aside. Given these factors, it's highly improbable that this specific scenario would unfold. The condition of Will Hurd being the Republican nominee is extremely unlikely to be met in the first place. Even if it were, there's little reason to believe it would cause Biden to suddenly decide not to accept the nomination, especially so late in the process."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "0400a4dd-a979-4787-bb94-db99355eb3d4", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Will Hurd be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?

(a) Will Hurd being the Republican nominee: Will Hurd is a former U.S. Representative from Texas who has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. However, he is currently considered a long-shot candidate for several reasons: 1. Low name recognition compared to frontrunners like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. 2. Moderate stance on some issues, which may not appeal to the Republican base. 3. Lack of significant fundraising or polling numbers. 4. The current dominance of Trump in polls and party support. Given these factors, the probability of Hurd securing the nomination is extremely low, likely less than 1%. (b) Joe Biden announcing he won't accept the Democratic nomination: Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has already announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. While there has been some speculation about his age and fitness for office, several factors suggest he is unlikely to withdraw: 1. Incumbency advantage is significant in U.S. politics. 2. Biden and his team have repeatedly affirmed his intention to run. 3. No strong alternative candidates have emerged within the Democratic Party. 4. Withdrawing would be seen as a major political upset and could harm the party's chances. The probability of Biden announcing he won't accept the nomination before July 15, 2024, is also very low, perhaps around 5-10%. For both events to occur, we need to multiply these already low probabilities, which results in an extremely small number. Even if we generously estimate Hurd's chances at 1% and Biden's withdrawal at 10%, the combined probability would be 0.01 * 0.10 = 0.001 or 0.1%.

Eurovision format: Both Georgia and Albania typically participate in the Eurovision Song Contest and have to go through semi-finals to reach the Grand Final. This means they are on equal footing in terms of the qualification process. 2. Historical performance: - Georgia has qualified for the Grand Final 7 times out of 14 appearances since their debut in 2007. - Albania has qualified for the Grand Final 10 times out of 19 appearances since their debut in 2004. Based on this, Albania has a slightly better track record of qualifying for the Grand Final. 3. Recent performance: - Georgia failed to qualify for the Grand Final in 2021, 2022, and 2023. - Albania qualified for the Grand Final in 2021 and 2022 but failed to qualify in 2023. This suggests that Albania has performed better in recent years, although both countries struggled in 2023. 4. Music industry and Eurovision focus: - Both countries have relatively small music industries compared to some European powerhouses, but they often take Eurovision seriously as a platform for international exposure. - Albania, in particular, has shown a consistent commitment to the contest with its long-running national selection process, Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs. 5. Voting patterns: - Neither country benefits significantly from diaspora voting or strong voting blocs, which means their qualification often depends more on the quality of their entries. 6. Unpredictability factor: - Eurovision results can be highly unpredictable, with factors like song quality, performance, staging, and running order playing crucial roles. - The assumption that Georgia qualifies doesn't necessarily indicate an overall trend for the semi-final results. Given that the question assumes Georgia qualifies, we must consider whether this implies a generally stronger semi-final performance from countries that don't typically dominate the contest. If so, this could slightly increase Albania's chances as well. However, the historical data shows that Albania has a better qualification record than Georgia. This suggests that if Georgia manages to qualify, there's a good chance Albania would qualify too, all other factors being equal. That said, Eurovision is notoriously unpredictable, and qualification depends heavily on the specific song, performance, and competition in a given year. The fact that Georgia qualifies doesn't guarantee anything for Albania.

Georgia's recent track record is particularly concerning, having failed to qualify for three consecutive years. Albania has had better recent success but also failed to qualify in the most recent contest. For both countries to qualify, they would each need to be among the top 10 in their respective semi-finals. While not impossible, this requires both countries to perform well simultaneously, which adds another layer of difficulty.

Semi-final allocation: The distribution of countries in each semi-final can affect qualification chances, but this is unknown at this time. Number of qualifiers: Typically, 10 countries qualify from each semi-final, which means 20 out of 35-37 countries in the semi-finals will qualify (about 54-57% of participants). Given Australia's perfect qualification record and Moldova's recent success, both countries have a good chance of qualifying. However, Eurovision results can be unpredictable, and factors like the quality of the specific 2024 entries and semi-final allocation are unknown. For both to qualify, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. Given Australia's consistency, I'd estimate their chances at around 90%.

The probability of this occurring is very low, perhaps around 5%. (b) Mike Pence being the Republican nominee: Donald Trump is currently the front-runner for the Republican nomination. Other candidates like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Tim Scott have more support than Mike Pence. Pence has distanced himself from Trump since the January 6 events, which has reduced his popularity among Trump supporters. While Pence has political experience, he lacks the strong base of support needed to secure the nomination. The probability of Pence becoming the nominee is also very low, perhaps around 2-3%.

Current polling trends: As of July 5, 2024, Trump is leading Biden by 2.4 points. This is within the range we're looking at (2-3 points), but there's still over a week for this to change. 2. Historical volatility: Presidential polling averages tend to fluctuate, but major shifts usually occur due to significant events or debates. Without knowing of any scheduled events between July 5 and July 15, we might expect relatively minor changes. 3. Margin of error: Most polls have a margin of error of around 3 percentage points. This means small changes in the average could easily push the lead in or out of our target range. 4. Time until election: July 15 is still several months before the November 2024 election. Polling averages tend to become more stable and predictive closer to the election date, but at this point, there's still room for significant shifts. 5. Political landscape: Without specific information about major political events or scandals in early July 2024, we have to assume a relatively stable political environment. 6. 538's methodology: 538's polling average is weighted and adjusted, which can sometimes lead to different results compared to simple averages of recent polls. Given that Trump's lead is already at 2.4 points on July 5, it's quite possible that it could remain within the 2-3 point range by July 15.

For Nvidia to overtake Apple would require a substantial shift in the market. Factors to consider: a) Nvidia has been experiencing significant growth due to the AI boom, while Apple's growth has been more steady. b) However, Apple is a much larger and more diversified company, making it less likely to be overtaken in market cap. c) Market conditions can change rapidly, especially in the tech sector. d) The timeframe (about a year from now) is long enough for significant market changes to occur. The relationship between these two events is not clear, and they seem to be independent. The polling numbers for the 2024 election are unlikely to have a direct, significant impact on the relative market caps of these two companies.

Competition: Universal Studios is opening a new park in Orlando (Epic Universe) in 2025, which might push Disney to announce new attractions to maintain interest. 7. Economic factors: Theme park investments are expensive, and Disney has faced some financial challenges recently. This could potentially limit new ride announcements. 8. Previous D23 announcements: Disney has a history of announcing new attractions at D23, but they also sometimes discuss ideas without firm commitments. 9. Specificity of the question: The question is very specific about the ride being for Magic Kingdom, not any other park, which narrows the possibilities. Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of this happening. Disney has good reasons to consider a Moana ride for Magic Kingdom, and D23 2024 would be an excellent time to announce it.

Likelihood of the condition being met: Disney has been expanding its theme park attractions based on popular franchises. Moana has been a successful Disney property, with a sequel announced for November 2024. However, there's no concrete information about a Moana ride for Magic Kingdom being planned. 2. 'Deadpool x Wolverine' box office potential: The movie combines two highly popular Marvel characters. Both Deadpool movies were very successful, with Deadpool 2 grossing $785 million worldwide. This will be the first Deadpool movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), potentially attracting a wider audience. Hugh Jackman's return as Wolverine adds significant star power and nostalgia factor. 3. Current R-rated opening weekend record: The record is held by 'Deadpool 2' with $284.5 million globally. 4. Factors that could boost 'Deadpool x Wolverine' performance: MCU integration and potential cameos from other Marvel characters. Pent-up demand for R-rated superhero content in the MCU. Strong marketing push expected from Disney/Marvel. 5. Potential challenges: R-rating may limit audience size compared to typical MCU releases. Competition from other summer blockbusters. Given these factors, I believe there's a strong chance that 'Deadpool x Wolverine' will break the R-rated opening weekend record, regardless of the Moana ride announcement. The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine, plus the MCU connection, creates a powerful draw that could easily surpass the previous Deadpool movies' performance. However, the condition of Disney announcing a Moana ride for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024 adds uncertainty. While it's possible, there's no strong indication that such an announcement is imminent. The lack of correlation between the two events means that the Moana ride announcement doesn't significantly impact the probability of the box office success.

However, there's no concrete evidence or rumors about a Moana ride for Magic Kingdom. The question specifies it must be for Magic Kingdom, not any other park. The announcement must be definitive, not just a discussion of ideas. D23 is a major event where Disney often announces new attractions, but not all planned attractions are announced there. Given these factors, while possible, it's not highly likely that Disney will announce a Moana ride specifically for Magic Kingdom at D23 2024. I'd estimate this at about 30% probability.

Israel's attack on Iran: The question asks about a deadly attack by Israel within Iran's borders before May 1, 2024. Several factors need to be considered: a) Historical context: Israel and Iran have been in a state of hostility for decades, with occasional covert operations and cyber attacks. b) Current tensions: As of the question's creation date (April 13, 2024), tensions between Israel and Iran are likely to be high due to ongoing regional conflicts and Iran's nuclear program. c) Time frame: The window for this attack is from April 13, 2024, to May 1, 2024 - a period of about 18 days. d) Severity of the attack: The question specifies at least five deaths, which is a relatively low threshold for a military operation. Given these factors, there's a significant possibility of such an attack occurring: 1. The short time frame (18 days) reduces the likelihood, as military operations often require longer planning. 2. However, the low death toll requirement (5 individuals) makes it more plausible, as even a small-scale operation could meet this criterion. 3. The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran increase the likelihood of conflict. 4. Israel has a history of conducting covert operations against Iran, which adds to the probability. Considering all these factors, I believe there is a moderate chance of such an attack occurring within the given timeframe."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "638081d9-359d-4706-8c2c-986eba9fb824", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average, and (2) Israel carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves **Yes** if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

As of now (April 2023), polls show a close race between Trump and Biden. While Trump has been leading in some polls, a lead of exactly 2-3 points is a narrow range.

However, a direct, deadly attack by Israel within Iran's borders would be a significant escalation. While not impossible, such an action would carry enormous risks and potential for wider conflict. Israel typically prefers covert operations or strikes on Iranian-linked targets outside of Iran itself. The timeframe (about a year) does provide some opportunity for escalation, but the condition of at least five deaths makes this less likely. Let's estimate this probability at around 15%.

Historical context: The VXVCLS is a measure of expected volatility in the S&P 500 index over the next three months. It tends to increase during periods of economic uncertainty or market stress. Current economic situation: As of April 2024, the global economy is still recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with various challenges such as inflation, supply chain issues, and geopolitical tensions. Comparison to July 2023: We need to consider the economic conditions and market sentiment in July 2023 as a baseline. Without specific data for that date, we can assume it was a period of relative stability as the world continued to recover from the pandemic. Potential factors affecting volatility in July 2024: a) Monetary policy: Central banks' decisions on interest rates and quantitative easing could impact market volatility. b) Geopolitical events: Ongoing conflicts or new tensions could increase uncertainty. c) Economic recovery: The pace and sustainability of economic growth could influence market sentiment. d) Technological disruptions: Rapid advancements or setbacks in key industries could affect market stability. e) Natural disasters or new health crises: Unforeseen events could significantly impact market volatility. Time frame: The question is asking about a specific date (July 20, 2024) which is about three months from the resolution date. This relatively short time frame makes it somewhat less likely for significant changes to occur compared to the previous year. Mean reversion: Volatility indices tend to revert to their mean over time, which suggests that unless there are significant new factors, the index might not be dramatically different from the previous year. Given these considerations, it's difficult to predict with high confidence whether the VXVCLS will be higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024. The global economy is likely to continue facing challenges, but it's also possible that many of the current uncertainties will have been resolved by then. The short time frame and tendency for mean reversion suggest that a dramatic increase is less likely.

Given the current global economic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions, and potential for market disruptions, it's plausible that the volatility index could be higher in July 2024 compared to July 2023. However, predicting market volatility over a year in advance is challenging and subject to many unpredictable factors. 2. Israel carrying out a deadly attack within Iran: The relationship between Israel and Iran has been tense for years, with both countries engaging in covert operations against each other. However, a direct, overt attack by Israel within Iran's borders resulting in at least five deaths would be a significant escalation. Such an action would carry enormous risks, including potential retaliation and international condemnation. Considering recent events: - The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has increased tensions in the region. - Iran's continued nuclear program development is a major concern for Israel. - There have been incidents of sabotage and cyberattacks attributed to both countries. However, a direct attack by Israel on Iranian soil would be a major escalation from the current state of affairs. Israel has generally preferred covert operations or strikes on Iranian-linked targets outside of Iran itself. The timeframe for this potential attack (before May 1, 2024) is relatively short, which reduces the likelihood of such a significant event occurring. Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that Israel will carry out a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024. The volatility index condition is more likely to be met, but still uncertain.

Participation of top players: While some top players may choose to skip the Olympics due to scheduling conflicts or other reasons, many elite players still prioritize the Olympics. The prestige of representing one's country often attracts strong participation. 4. Specialization in multiple events: Many top tennis players are skilled in both singles and doubles, increasing their chances of competing and medaling in multiple events. 5. Team strength: Some countries have particularly strong tennis teams, which increases the likelihood of their players competing in multiple events and potentially winning multiple medals. 6. Time between the question creation and the event: The question was created in April 2024, relatively close to the Olympics, which means we have a good idea of the current form and rankings of potential participants. Given these factors, it seems quite likely that at least one athlete will win more than one medal in tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The multiple event format, historical precedent, and the tendency for top players to compete in more than one event all contribute to this likelihood. However, we must also consider potential factors that could reduce this probability: - Increased competition and parity in international tennis - Potential injuries or unexpected upsets - Changes in Olympic format or rules (although no significant changes have been announced) Balancing these considerations, I believe there is a high probability of an athlete winning more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "7cbf9e41-f420-4e5c-9cb2-1b35d0576745", "title": "Given an athlete wins more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics, will Individual Neutral Athletes win \u226521 gold medals?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: An athlete wins more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

(a) An athlete wins more than one medal for tennis: Tennis at the Olympics typically includes singles, doubles, and mixed doubles events. It's not uncommon for top players to participate in multiple events, increasing their chances of winning multiple medals. However, the competition is fierce, and winning multiple medals is challenging. Looking at recent Olympics: - In Tokyo 2020, no player won multiple tennis medals. - In Rio 2016, Andy Murray won gold in singles and silver in mixed doubles. - In London 2012, Serena Williams won gold in both singles and doubles. Given these historical patterns, the probability of at least one athlete winning multiple tennis medals is moderate, perhaps around 40-50%.

The overall competitiveness of these athletes. 3. The total number of events they're allowed to participate in. In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes competing as the Russian Olympic Committee won 20 gold medals. However, the situation for Paris 2024 is different: - There are restrictions on the number of Russian and Belarusian athletes allowed to compete. - They must compete as neutrals without national symbols. - Some sports federations have banned them entirely. Given these restrictions, it seems unlikely that Individual Neutral Athletes will reach 21 gold medals. The probability for this condition is low, perhaps around 10-20%. For both conditions to occur, we need to multiply their individual probabilities.

Trend direction: If there's a trend in Trump's favor, it might continue, potentially pushing his lead slightly higher. 7. Regression to the mean: There's often a tendency for polling numbers to move back towards historical averages over time. Given these factors, it seems reasonably likely that Trump's lead could remain within the 2 to 4 point range. The current 2.4 point lead is already within this range, and while it could change, the short time frame makes it less likely to move dramatically outside this range. However, there's still a significant chance it could fall below 2 points or rise above 4 points. Small fluctuations could push it just outside the range, and unexpected events could cause larger shifts.

Polling data: The scenario describes Trump having a lead of 2-4 points over Biden on July 15, 2024. While this indicates a potential advantage for Trump, it's important to note that: a) Polls can fluctuate significantly in the months leading up to an election. b) A 2-4 point lead is not insurmountable, especially this far out from the election. c) National polling doesn't necessarily reflect the Electoral College outcome. 3.

(a) At least 5 countries winning their first-ever Olympic gold medal: This is a challenging condition to meet. In recent Olympics, the number of countries winning their first gold medal has been relatively low. For example: - Tokyo 2020: 3 countries (San Marino, Burkina Faso, Turkmenistan) - Rio 2016: 3 countries (Fiji, Jordan, Kosovo) - London 2012: 3 countries (Bahrain, Cyprus, Grenada) Given this historical trend, it seems unlikely that 5 or more countries will win their first gold in Paris 2024.

Probability for (a): Around 0.2 (20%) (b) Individual Neutral Athletes winning at least 15 gold medals: This condition is highly dependent on the geopolitical situation, particularly regarding Russian and Belarusian athletes. In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes competing as the Russian Olympic Committee won 20 gold medals. However, the situation for Paris 2024 is different: 1. The IOC has recommended allowing individual Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutral athletes, but with strict conditions. 2. Many sports federations have not yet decided on their participation. 3. The number of neutral athletes allowed to compete is likely to be limited. 4. Some top Russian athletes may be excluded due to connections with the military or state-backed clubs. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that neutral athletes will reach 15 gold medals. Even if they are allowed to compete in significant numbers, reaching this threshold would be challenging. Probability for (b): Around 0.15 (15%) For both conditions to occur, we need to multiply these probabilities: 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03.

Staging and performance: Both countries have demonstrated competence in staging and live performances in recent years. Given these factors, Switzerland appears to have a stronger recent track record and seems more likely to qualify. Portugal's chances are less certain, given their mixed recent results.

The ID (Identity and Democracy) group in the European Parliament consists of such parties. 3. Current composition of the European Parliament: As of 2023, the ID group is the 5th largest group in the European Parliament, behind the EPP, S&D, Renew Europe, and Greens/EFA. To become the largest group, they would need to gain a significant number of seats. 4. National politics influencing EU elections: If France's government shifts away from centrist parties, it could indicate a broader trend across Europe that might benefit right-wing parties represented in the ID group. 5. Fragmentation of other political groups: The question of whether ID becomes the largest group also depends on how other groups perform. If centrist and left-wing votes are split among multiple groups, it could potentially allow ID to emerge as the largest single group. 6.

Ted Cruz has not announced his candidacy for 2024, and even if he does, he would face an uphill battle against Trump's popularity within the party. Additionally, other candidates like Ron DeSantis are seen as more likely alternatives to Trump than Cruz. The probability of Cruz becoming the nominee is very low, perhaps around 1-2%. 2. Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3 on July 15, 2024: This condition is more plausible but still quite specific. Current polls show a close race between Trump and Biden, with leads often within the margin of error. A lead of 2-3 points is certainly possible, but it's a narrow range. There's also a lot of time until July 2024, during which many factors could influence the polls. The probability of this specific lead occurring on that exact date is moderate, perhaps around 15-20%.

Moreover, resigning from the presidency is an extraordinarily rare event in U.S. history, having happened only once with Richard Nixon. (b) USD/JPY exchange rate: As of July 2023, the USD/JPY exchange rate is around 144. Predicting currency exchange rates over a year in advance is notoriously difficult due to the multitude of factors that can influence them, including economic policies, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. While it's not implausible for the rate to be at or above 145 in August 2024, it's far from certain. The key point here is that both of these events must occur for the question to resolve YES. Even if we consider each event individually as having a modest probability (which is generous, especially for the Biden scenario), the combined probability would be very low due to the multiplication of probabilities for independent events.

While Donald Trump Jr. is a prominent figure in Republican circles, he has not indicated any serious intention to run for president. The Republican field for 2024 is likely to be crowded, with more experienced politicians and his own father, Donald Trump, potentially running. Trump Jr. lacks the political experience typically expected of presidential nominees.

Strategic importance: The bridge is crucial for Russia's military logistics and symbolic control over Crimea. This makes it a high-value target for Ukrainian forces. 3. Ukrainian capabilities: Ukraine has shown the ability to strike targets deep within Russian-controlled territory, including previous attempts on the bridge. 4. Time frame: The question covers a period of about two months (from May 3 to July 1, 2024). This is a relatively short time frame, which somewhat reduces the likelihood of an attack occurring within this specific period. 5. Defensive measures: Russia is likely to have increased security and defensive measures around the bridge following previous attacks, making future attempts more challenging. 6. Ongoing conflict: The question is set in the future, and it's difficult to predict the exact state of the conflict by then. However, if the war is still ongoing, the motivation for such an attack would remain high. 7.

The potential impact of such an attack on US politics: While an attack on the Crimean Bridge would be a significant international incident, it's unlikely to directly impact Joe Biden's presidency. The US is not directly involved in the conflict, and such an event would not typically trigger a change in US leadership. 3. Joe Biden's current position and term: Biden's first term as president ends in January 2025. The question asks about his status as president in July 2024, which is well before the end of his term and before the 2024 presidential election (typically held in November). 4. Potential scenarios that could remove Biden from office: - Impeachment and conviction: This is a lengthy process and highly unlikely to occur and conclude within a month, especially over an international incident not directly involving the US. - Resignation: There's no indication that Biden plans to resign, and an attack on the Crimean Bridge is unlikely to prompt such a decision. - Health issues: While Biden's age is a factor, there's no specific reason to believe he would be unable to serve through July 2024 due to health concerns. 5.

However, issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli leaders would be a major diplomatic move with significant international repercussions. Several factors make this unlikely in the given timeframe: - The ICC investigations and legal processes are typically slow. - Israel is not a member of the ICC, which complicates jurisdiction. - There would likely be strong opposition from the US and other Israeli allies. - The political sensitivity of such actions might cause hesitation. However, the escalating situation in Gaza and increasing international pressure could potentially accelerate ICC actions. Importantly, these two events are largely independent. Biden's incapacitation would not directly influence ICC decisions, though it could indirectly affect US foreign policy and support for Israel. Given the low probability of Biden's incapacitation and the relatively short timeframe for ICC action, the overall probability of both events occurring is very low. However, it's not impossible given the volatile nature of both US politics and the Middle East situation."}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "e66a21e8-f702-4482-af02-36e938dfd093", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024 and (b) the ICC issue arrest warrants for any listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024?", "body": "(a) Resolves YES if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet (or other relevant body) invokes Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to formally declare that \"the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" and cause the Vice President to serve as Acting President, before August 2024 (Eastern time).

Let's analyze each separately: (a) Biden being declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment Section 4 before August 2024: This is an extremely rare and serious event that has never been invoked in US history. While Biden is the oldest serving president and there have been concerns about his age and mental acuity, there's no concrete evidence suggesting he's unable to discharge his duties. His administration and party have consistently defended his capability. For this to happen, it would require a significant and sudden decline in Biden's health or mental state, coupled with a willingness from his own cabinet to take this extraordinary step. The likelihood of this occurring is very low. (b) ICC issuing arrest warrants for listed Israeli leaders before July 1, 2024: The ICC has been investigating alleged war crimes in Palestinian territories, and there's increasing international pressure on Israel regarding its actions in Gaza. However, issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli leaders is a major step that would have significant diplomatic repercussions. While it's more plausible than condition (a), it's still not highly likely in the given timeframe. The ICC moves slowly, and Israel is not a member of the ICC, which complicates matters. Additionally, powerful allies like the US often shield Israel from such actions. For both of these unlikely events to occur within the specified timeframes is extremely improbable.

Biden is the incumbent, which gives him a strong position within the party. 2. Age and health concerns: Biden will be 81 years old at the time of the 2024 election, making him the oldest president in US history. There are ongoing concerns about his age and mental acuity, which could potentially lead to a decision not to run. 3. Current statements and actions: As of now, Biden has repeatedly stated his intention to run for re-election. His campaign has already begun preparations for 2024, including fundraising and staffing. 4.

This suggests strong party support for his potential re-election bid. 5. Political climate: While Biden's approval ratings have been low, they have shown some improvement in recent months. The outcome of the 2022 midterm elections, where Democrats performed better than expected, has strengthened Biden's position within the party. 6.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that Biden would announce he will not accept the nomination before July 15, 2024.

Joe Biden announcing he will not accept the Democratic nomination before July 15, 2024: Currently, Joe Biden is the incumbent president and has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2024. While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for a younger candidate, Biden and his team have consistently reaffirmed his commitment to running. It's relatively rare for an incumbent president to decide not to seek re-election, especially after already announcing their intention to run. However, given Biden's age and potential health concerns, there's a small possibility he might step aside. I'd estimate the probability of this happening at around 10%. 2. Chris Christie becoming the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election: Chris Christie, former Governor of New Jersey, has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican nomination. However, he faces significant challenges: - Donald Trump remains the frontrunner in most polls, with a substantial lead. - Other candidates like Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Tim Scott have more current political relevance and support. - Christie's previous presidential run in 2016 was unsuccessful, and his criticism of Trump may alienate a significant portion of the Republican base. Given these factors, Christie's chances of securing the nomination appear quite low. I'd estimate the probability at around 2%.

Trump is already facing charges in Georgia related to attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. However, these charges do not currently include witness tampering. 4. For this scenario to occur, prosecutors would need to find evidence of witness tampering, which is a separate offense from the current charges. 5.

While there have been concerns about his age and some calls for him to step aside, he has consistently expressed his intention to run for re-election. For him to both drop out of the race and resign from office would be an extraordinary and unprecedented event.

This condition doesn't affect the probability of the main question but sets the context. 2. Legal challenges to Trump's candidacy: There have been attempts to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from running for office due to his alleged role in the January 6th Capitol riot. However, as of now (September 2023), these attempts have not been successful at a state level. 3. Ongoing investigations: Trump is currently facing multiple investigations and legal challenges, which could potentially lead to criminal charges. If convicted of certain crimes, this could strengthen arguments for his disqualification under the 14th Amendment. 4. State-level actions: Different states may have varying interpretations and applications of the 14th Amendment. Some states might be more inclined to attempt to remove Trump from the ballot than others. 5. Time frame: The resolution date is July 15, 2024, which gives almost a year for legal challenges and state-level actions to unfold. 6.

Political climate: The political polarization in the U.S. might make some states more likely to attempt such a move, while others would strongly resist it. 8. Supreme Court: Any attempt to remove Trump from a state ballot would likely face immediate legal challenges and could quickly reach the Supreme Court, which might be reluctant to allow such a significant intervention in the electoral process.

Both countries have struggled in recent years, with Georgia having more difficulty. The qualification rate for each country in a semi-final is roughly 10/17 \u2248 59% (assuming 17 countries per semi-final). For both countries to qualify, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. If we assume they each have a 50% chance of qualifying (which is slightly pessimistic given the average qualification rate, but accounts for their recent struggles), the probability of both qualifying would be 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. However, given Lithuania's slightly better track record and more recent successes, we might adjust their probability upward slightly, while keeping Georgia's lower due to their recent difficulties. Probability: 0.22. This probability reflects the challenging nature of both countries qualifying, given their recent performances and the competitive nature of Eurovision semi-finals.

Historical performance: Czechia has qualified for the Grand Final 3 times out of 10 attempts since 2007 (30% success rate). Armenia has a better track record, qualifying 10 times out of 14 attempts since 2006 (71% success rate). 2. Recent performance: Czechia qualified in 2022 but failed to qualify in 2023. Armenia qualified in both 2022 and 2023. 3. Eurovision voting patterns: Czechia doesn't have strong diaspora voting or consistent allies in the contest. Armenia often benefits from diaspora voting and has some consistent voting allies. 4. Quality of entries: As the songs for 2024 haven't been selected yet, we can't judge their quality. Both countries have shown the ability to send competitive entries in recent years. 5. Semi-final allocation: The semi-final allocation is not known at this time, which could impact their chances. 6. Number of qualifiers: Typically, 10 countries qualify from each semi-final, out of about 16-18 participants. Given these factors, Armenia has a higher individual chance of qualifying than Czechia. For both to qualify, we need to multiply their individual probabilities. Estimating conservatively: Armenia's chances: ~70% (based on their consistent performance) Czechia's chances: ~40% (slightly higher than their historical average due to recent improvement) The probability of both qualifying would be approximately 0.70 * 0.40 = 0.28 or 28%.

This gives them a qualification rate of about 61%, which is reasonably good. 2. Recent performance: In the last five years (2019-2023), Iceland qualified for the Grand Final four times, missing out only in 2023. This recent track record is quite strong. 3. Music industry and cultural factors: Iceland has a vibrant music scene and often sends unique, quirky entries that stand out in the competition. This distinctiveness can be an advantage in catching voters' attention. 4. Voting patterns: Iceland tends to receive consistent support from Nordic countries and other nations with similar musical tastes, which can help in the semi-finals. 5.

Recent performance: Georgia has failed to qualify for the Grand Final in the last four contests they participated in (2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023). This suggests a recent downward trend in their performance. 3. Correlation with Iceland: There's no strong historical correlation between Iceland and Georgia's qualifications. They are in different geographic regions and often perform different styles of music. 4. Semi-final allocation: We don't know which semi-final Georgia will be in, or if they'll be in the same one as Iceland. This adds uncertainty to the prediction. 5. Voting patterns: Georgia typically receives points from neighboring countries and former Soviet states, which may not be enough to secure qualification consistently. 6. Quality of entry: We don't know the quality of Georgia's entry for 2024, which is a crucial factor in qualification chances. 7. Competition level: The overall strength of other entries in Georgia's semi-final will affect their chances, but this is unknown at this time. 8.

Given Georgia's historical 50% qualification rate, but considering their recent poor performance and the lack of correlation with Iceland's results, I would estimate their chances of qualification to be slightly below their historical average. The recent trend is particularly concerning, suggesting that Georgia may be struggling to adapt to current Eurovision trends or audience preferences.
