Competition: The Republican field is likely to include several high-profile candidates, including potentially former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and other seasoned politicians. These individuals have significant political capital, fundraising capabilities, and established voter bases. 3. Party Dynamics: The Republican Party has been navigating internal divisions, particularly between traditional conservatives and more populist elements. A candidate like Ramaswamy would need to appeal broadly across these factions, which could be challenging given his outsider status. 4. Media Presence and Public Perception: Ramaswamy would need to significantly increase his media presence and public recognition to compete with more well-known candidates. This involves not only gaining media coverage but also resonating with key Republican voter issues. 5. Historical Precedent: Historically, the Republican Party has tended to nominate candidates with substantial political experience or prior runs for the presidency. Outsider candidates have faced significant hurdles in securing the nomination. 6. Timing and Campaign Infrastructure: Building a successful presidential campaign requires substantial infrastructure, including fundraising, staffing, and grassroots support.

Historically, Russian athletes have faced restrictions, such as competing under a neutral flag, due to state-sponsored doping allegations. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has taken steps to ensure fair competition, which has included barring athletes from countries with systemic doping issues. As of the last update, there is no blanket ban on Russian athletes for the 2024 Olympics. However, the situation is fluid and could change based on geopolitical developments, particularly related to the ongoing conflict involving Russia. The IOC's decisions are influenced by political pressures, international relations, and the need to uphold the integrity of the Games. Given the criteria for the question to resolve as YES\u2014no more than 34 Russian athletes competing under any flag\u2014there remains a possibility of a significant restriction being placed on Russian athletes. However, unless there is a significant escalation in international pressure or new revelations related to doping, it is more likely that Russian athletes will be allowed to compete, albeit possibly under a neutral flag, as was the case in previous Olympics.

Surveillance is conducted through a network of acute care hospitals in select counties or county equivalents in 12 states for RSV surveillance, 13 states for COVID-19 surveillance, and 14 states for influenza surveillance. The surveillance platforms for COVID-19, RSV, and influenza (known as [COVID-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covid-net/purpose-methods.html), [RSV-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/overview-methods.html), and [FluSurv-NET](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/influenza-hospitalization-surveillance.htm), respectively) cover more than 30 million people and include an estimated 8-10% of the U.S. population.\n\nThe underlying source data for the RESP-NET dashboard can be found at [this link](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-Laboratory-Confirmed-RSV-COVID-19-and-Flu/kvib-3txy).\n\nIn its [Respiratory Disease Season Outlook](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/whats-new/2023-2024-season-outlook.html) for 2023-24, the CDC describes the 2022-23 peak as a \"tripledemic\" due to high incidence of COVID, flu, and RSV at the same time.

Influenza typically peaks in the winter months, often around December to February. RSV also peaks in the colder months, often slightly earlier than influenza. COVID-19 has shown variability, but winter peaks have been common due to increased indoor activity and holiday gatherings.\n\n2. **Overlap of Peaks**: The likelihood of these three viruses peaking close to each other is reasonable given their overlapping seasons. In past seasons, there have been instances where influenza and RSV peaked around the same time, and COVID-19 peaks have sometimes coincided with these due to similar transmission dynamics.\n\n3. **Data Reporting and Revisions**: The CDC's RESP-NET data may have reporting delays, but the question accounts for this by considering the final data after revisions. This reduces uncertainty related to initial reporting inaccuracies.\n\n4. **Public Health Measures and Vaccination**: The availability and uptake of vaccines for these viruses can influence the timing and magnitude of peaks. High vaccination rates may flatten or delay peaks, potentially affecting their alignment.\n\n5. **Current Trends**: As of the latest data, there are no unprecedented changes in the behavior of these viruses that would suggest a major deviation from typical seasonal patterns.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that the maximum weekly hospitalization rates for COVID, influenza, and RSV will occur within four weeks of each other is reasonably high.

Even strong entries can fail to qualify due to unfavorable running order, strong competition, or lack of appeal to either juries or the public. Additionally, the semi-final allocation can impact the likelihood of qualification, as some semi-finals are perceived as more competitive than others.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it is certainly possible for Ireland to qualify, the recent trend and competition level suggest a cautious estimate.

Chasiv Yar is located in the Donetsk region, which has been a focal point of conflict. Historically, Russia has shown interest in consolidating control over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, claiming them as part of the so-called 'People's Republics.' However, several considerations must be taken into account: 1. Ukrainian Resistance and Counteroffensives: Ukraine has been conducting counteroffensives to reclaim territories occupied by Russian forces. The effectiveness and intensity of these operations can significantly impact the control of regions like Chasiv Yar. 2. International Support for Ukraine: Western countries have been providing military aid and intelligence support to Ukraine, potentially bolstering its ability to resist Russian advances and reclaim lost territory. 3. Russian Military Strategy and Capabilities: Russia's military strategy, logistical capabilities, and willingness to sustain prolonged conflict will influence its ability to maintain or expand territorial control. 4. Diplomatic Developments: Any potential ceasefire agreements or peace negotiations could alter the territorial dynamics, affecting control over regions like Chasiv Yar. 5. ISW Reporting: The resolution of this question relies on the assessment by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

China is aware that a military conflict would likely draw in the United States and other allies of Taiwan, potentially leading to a broader conflict. Taiwan, on the other hand, would likely avoid provocation that could lead to a direct military confrontation.\n\nGiven the short time frame until June 6, 2024, and the high stakes involved, it is less likely that either side would engage in actions leading to military casualties. Diplomatic efforts and international pressure are likely to play a role in preventing an escalation."}, "prob": 0.2}, "prob": 0.2, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.3219, "brier_score": 0.04, "brier_score_scaled": 84.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.7417, "calibrated_prob": 0.2326, "brier_score": 0.0541, "brier_score_scaled": 78.4, "log_score": 0.3819}}

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\n\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\n\n>Tesla\u2019s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\n\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\n\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\n\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\n\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\n\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\n\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has [advised](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1) shareholders *not* to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\n\n---------------------\n\nSee related question:\n\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)"}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of ISS advising against Elon Musk's $57 billion package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk, we need to consider several factors.

Historically, ISS has been critical of large executive compensation packages, especially if they are perceived as excessive or not aligned with shareholder interests. Elon Musk's $57 billion package has been a subject of controversy, and ISS has previously advised against similar large compensation packages in other companies. Additionally, the governance practices at Tesla, including board composition and related party transactions, have been under scrutiny. Kimbal Musk, being Elon Musk's brother, raises potential concerns about board independence, which ISS often considers in their recommendations. Given these considerations and ISS's track record of advocating for shareholder rights and governance best practices, there is a reasonable likelihood that ISS might advise against either the pay package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk.

To evaluate whether the VXVCLS will be higher on July 20, 2024, compared to July 20, 2023, we need to consider several aspects:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Volatility indices can fluctuate significantly due to market conditions. If July 2023 had unusually low volatility, it might be more likely for July 2024 to have a higher index value. Conversely, if July 2023 had high volatility, the index might be lower in 2024 if market conditions stabilize.\n\n2. **Current Market Conditions**: As of July 2024, the market conditions leading up to this date will heavily influence the VXVCLS. Factors such as economic data releases, Federal Reserve policy changes, corporate earnings reports, and geopolitical tensions can all impact market volatility.\n\n3. **Economic and Geopolitical Factors**: Any major economic downturns, inflation concerns, interest rate changes, or geopolitical conflicts that arise between now and July 2024 could increase market volatility and raise the VXVCLS.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment and Trends**: Investor sentiment and market trends, such as shifts in risk appetite, can also affect volatility levels. For example, if investors are generally optimistic and risk-taking, volatility might decrease, whereas increased risk aversion could lead to higher volatility.\n\nGiven these considerations, predicting the exact level of the VXVCLS a year in advance is challenging due to the inherent unpredictability of the factors involved. However, considering the general tendency for volatility to revert to the mean, and assuming no extreme market events, the probability of the index being higher year-over-year is moderate."}, "prob": 0.55}, "prob": 0.55, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.8625, "brier_score": 0.2025, "brier_score_scaled": 19.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.7417, "calibrated_prob": 0.3909, "brier_score": 0.371, "brier_score_scaled": -48.4, "log_score": 1.355}}

Historically, the Core CPI has shown variability based on economic conditions, monetary policy, and external factors such as supply chain disruptions or changes in consumer demand.\n\n1. **Recent Trends**: Historically, monthly changes in Core CPI have often exceeded 0.1%, especially in periods of economic recovery or expansion. Given the data up to October 2023, if the economy is growing and inflationary pressures are present, it is plausible that Core CPI could increase by more than 0.1%.\n\n2. **Monetary Policy**: The Federal Reserve's actions, such as interest rate adjustments, can influence inflation. If the Fed has been implementing policies to curb inflation, this might dampen the increase. Conversely, if they are stimulating the economy, this could lead to higher inflation.\n\n3. **Economic Indicators**: Other economic indicators such as employment rates, wage growth, and consumer spending can provide insights into inflationary pressures. If these indicators suggest robust economic activity, it is more likely that Core CPI will see a significant increase.\n\n4. **External Factors**: Geopolitical events, changes in trade policies, or disruptions in supply chains can also impact prices and inflation.\n\nGiven these factors, while there is always uncertainty, the likelihood of a more than 0.1% increase in Core CPI in a single month is relatively high based on historical patterns and potential economic conditions."}, "prob": 0.65}, "prob": 0.65, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.6215, "brier_score": 0.1225, "brier_score_scaled": 51.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.7417, "calibrated_prob": 0.4208, "brier_score": 0.3355, "brier_score_scaled": -34.2, "log_score": 1.2488}}

If the U.S. economy performs strongly relative to Japan, it could lead to a stronger USD.\n\n2. **Monetary Policy**: The actions of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan are critical. If the Fed raises interest rates more aggressively than the Bank of Japan, it could lead to a stronger USD relative to the JPY. Conversely, if the Bank of Japan tightens its monetary policy, this could strengthen the JPY.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Events**: Events such as trade negotiations, political stability, or conflicts can cause volatility in currency markets. Any events that favor the USD or weaken the JPY could push the exchange rate above 145.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment and risk appetite can lead to fluctuations in the exchange rate. A risk-off environment might strengthen the JPY as a safe-haven currency, while a risk-on environment might favor the USD.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Historically, the USD/JPY has shown significant volatility. As of the last available data in October 2023, the exchange rate was around 145 JPY per USD. This suggests that the rate is already near the threshold, and slight movements in the market could push it above or below this level by August 2024.\n\nConsidering these factors, while the exchange rate is currently near 145 JPY per USD, the balance of economic indicators, monetary policy trends, and market sentiment will determine its movement.

Hans Niemann's performance would also need to be considered, but given So's higher ranking and experience, he is likely the favorite.\n\n4. **Head-to-Head Record**: If available, the head-to-head record between the two players in similar formats would be useful. However, given So's higher ranking and experience, it is reasonable to assume he has a favorable record.\n\n5. **External Factors**: There are no major external factors mentioned that could affect the outcome, such as a recent change in format or rules that might disadvantage one player over the other.\n\nGiven these considerations, Wesley So is likely to win the match against Hans Niemann."}, "prob": 0.75}, "prob": 0.75, "resolution": false, "log_score": 2.0, "brier_score": 0.5625, "brier_score_scaled": -125.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.7417, "calibrated_prob": 0.4469, "brier_score": 0.1997, "brier_score_scaled": 20.1, "log_score": 0.8543}}

Night Shyamalan's \"Trap\" will gross more than $20 million during its domestic opening weekend, we should consider several factors:\n\n1. **Director's Track Record**: M. Night Shyamalan is a well-known director with a mixed box office history. Some of his films, like \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Split,\" have been very successful, while others have underperformed. His recent film \"Old\" had a domestic opening of approximately $16.85 million. This suggests that while his films do have a draw, they don't always hit high numbers.\n\n2. **Market Conditions**: The box office environment in 2024 may be different from previous years due to factors such as post-pandemic recovery, competition from streaming platforms, and the general state of the economy. These factors can influence movie-going habits.\n\n3. **Marketing and Hype**: The level of marketing and pre-release hype can significantly impact a film's opening weekend. If \"Trap\" has a strong marketing campaign and generates significant buzz, it could attract a larger audience.\n\n4. **Competition**: The presence of competing films during the same weekend can affect box office performance. If \"Trap\" is released alongside other highly anticipated films, it might struggle to reach the $20 million mark.\n\n5. **Genre and Appeal**: Shyamalan's films often fall into the thriller or horror genre, which can have a strong but niche audience. The appeal of the film's concept and execution will also play a role in attracting audiences.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a possibility for \"Trap\" to exceed $20 million, it seems more likely to perform similarly to \"Old\" unless there are significant positive factors like exceptional marketing or positive early reviews. Therefore, the probability of \"Trap\" grossing more than $20 million on its opening weekend is moderate but not high."}, "prob": 0.4}, "prob": 0.4, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.737, "brier_score": 0.16, "brier_score_scaled": 36.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.7417, "calibrated_prob": 0.3363, "brier_score": 0.1131, "brier_score_scaled": 54.8, "log_score": 0.5915}}

This indicates a strong reception for many episodes. Season 2, however, shows more variability, with ratings ranging from 6.1 to 9.6. Notably, Season 2 Episode 4 received a high rating of 9.6, which suggests that the season is capable of delivering highly acclaimed episodes.\n\n2. **Season Trends**: Season 2 has shown a mix of high and low ratings, indicating possible inconsistency in audience reception. However, the significant drop in ratings for Episodes 5 and 6 (7.6 and 6.1 respectively) might suggest a dip in quality or a shift in viewer expectations. Episode 7's rating is unknown, but if it follows the pattern of alternating high and low ratings, it could potentially be higher, setting a positive context for Episode 8.\n\n3. **Episode Positioning**: Being the season finale, Episode 8 might be expected to deliver a strong conclusion, potentially boosting its rating. Season finales often aim to resolve major plotlines and deliver impactful storytelling, which can positively influence ratings.\n\n4. **Audience Expectations and Hype**: The anticipation surrounding a season finale can drive higher initial ratings, as dedicated fans are more likely to rate the episode soon after watching. However, this can also lead to inflated scores that might adjust over time. Since the rating is taken two days after release, it might still reflect this initial enthusiasm.\n\n5. **External Factors**: The timing of the release, competition from other shows, and any external events affecting viewership could also influence ratings, but these are harder to predict without specific information.\n\nOverall, while there is variability in Season 2's ratings, the historical trend of strong season finales and the potential for Episode 7 to set a positive stage for Episode 8 suggest a reasonable chance that the finale could exceed a rating of 8.5.

Their form leading up to the Olympics will be crucial. Van der Poel is known for his explosive style and ability to perform in one-day races, while van Aert is highly versatile, excelling in both one-day races and stage races.\n\n2. **Course Suitability:** The Paris Olympic Road Race course is expected to have a mix of flat and hilly sections. Both riders are capable of handling such terrains, but van der Poel might have a slight edge on more technical and punchy courses due to his cyclocross background.\n\n3. **Team Dynamics:** The support each rider receives from their national teams can impact their performance. Van Aert, riding for Belgium, often has strong team support, which can be crucial in strategic parts of the race. Van der Poel, representing the Netherlands, also benefits from a strong team but might have to contend with more internal competition.\n\n4. **Race Tactics and Strategy:** The outcome can heavily depend on race tactics, including breakaways, pacing, and sprint finishes. Both riders are tactically astute, but van Aert has a slight advantage in sprint finishes if it comes down to that.\n\n5. **Past Head-to-Head:** Historically, both riders have had close contests, with van der Poel sometimes edging out van Aert in one-day races. However, van Aert's consistency and ability to handle longer distances give him a slight edge.\n\n6. **External Factors:** Weather conditions, health, and any unforeseen incidents like crashes can also influence the outcome.\n\nConsidering these factors, while both riders are highly competitive, van Aert's versatility and team support might give him a slight edge.

The stock has generally been performing well, often trading significantly above $100 per share.\n\n1. **Recent Performance**: Nvidia's stock price has been robust, with significant growth over the past few years due to its leadership in technology and innovation. It is unlikely that there would be a drastic drop to below $100 without a major negative catalyst.\n\n2. **Market Conditions**: The broader market conditions, including interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, can impact Nvidia's stock.

This interest suggests a non-zero probability of his involvement in Bitcoin-related events.\n\n2. **Past Participation in Conferences**: Musk has a history of participating in various conferences and events, especially those related to technology and innovation. However, his participation is often selective and based on his interests and schedule.\n\n3. **Current Commitments and Schedule**: As of the latest information, Musk is involved in multiple high-profile roles, including CEO positions at Tesla, SpaceX, and other ventures. His busy schedule might limit his availability to attend events like the Bitcoin Nashville 2024.\n\n4. **Reputation and Influence**: Musk's presence at such an event would likely draw significant attention and could be beneficial for the conference. This might incentivize organizers to invite him and potentially sway Musk to consider attending.\n\n5. **Public Announcements**: As of now, there are no public announcements or indications that Elon Musk is scheduled to appear at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024.

Season 1 of \"House of the Dragon\" had a strong reception with multiple episodes scoring above 8.5, including episodes 7, 8, 9, and 10. Season 2 has shown more variability, with ratings ranging from 7.6 to 9.6. Notably, Season 2, Episode 4 achieved a high rating of 9.6, indicating that the season is capable of producing highly-rated episodes.\n\nGiven this context, the probability of S2E7 receiving a rating greater than 8.5 is influenced by several factors:\n\n1. **Historical Performance**: Season 1 had several episodes above 8.5, and Season 2 has at least one episode (E4) with a significantly high rating. This suggests that the show has the potential to produce episodes that are well-received by audiences.\n\n2. **Recent Trends**: Season 2 has been more variable in its ratings, with some episodes falling below 8.0. However, the presence of a 9.6 rating in Episode 4 suggests that high ratings are achievable within the current season.\n\n3. **Fan Base and Critical Reception**: The show has a strong fan base and generally positive critical reception, which can contribute to higher ratings, especially if the episode contains significant plot developments or high-quality production.\n\n4. **Timing of the Rating**: The rating is taken two days after release, which might still reflect initial enthusiasm from dedicated fans. Over time, ratings can fluctuate as more viewers weigh in, but the early rating is often higher due to the most engaged viewers rating first.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is variability in the ratings of Season 2, the potential for a high rating exists based on past performance and the episode's ability to capture the audience's interest.

Additionally, the presence of any recent similar ordinances that have passed or failed could provide insight into the council's current stance and priorities.\n\nThe timing of the meeting is also crucial.

Therefore, any indications of potential delays or procedural hurdles should be factored into the probability estimate.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, if there is significant support from the council and no major procedural barriers, the probability of the ordinance passing is higher.

Wolverine, while not as strong in standalone films, benefits from the broader X-Men franchise appeal.\n\n2. **Star Power**: The inclusion of both characters in one film could attract a larger audience. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine are significant draws for fans.\n\n3. **Market Trends**: The box office has been recovering post-pandemic, with several films achieving strong openings in 2023 and 2024. This trend could continue, benefiting \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\n4. **Competition and Release Timing**: The release schedule around the film's opening will impact its box office performance. If there are no major competing releases, it could help boost its numbers.\n\n5. **Marketing and Reception**: Effective marketing and positive pre-release buzz can significantly impact opening weekend performance. If the film receives strong reviews and has an effective marketing campaign, it could surpass the target.\n\nGiven these factors, the potential for \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" to have a strong opening is high, especially considering the combined fan bases and the current box office climate.

If they are teammates, intra-team dynamics and car development will be key factors.\n\n3. **Track Characteristics**: The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps is known for its challenging and high-speed layout, which can favor drivers with strong technical skills and a well-balanced car. Historical performance of both drivers at this track could provide additional context.\n\n4. **Weather Conditions**: Spa is notorious for unpredictable weather, which can influence race outcomes. Drivers with better adaptability to changing conditions may have an advantage.\n\n5. **Qualifying and Race Incidents**: Starting positions determined by qualifying and potential race incidents (e.g., crashes, mechanical failures) can also affect the final result.\n\nGiven these considerations, if Tsunoda and Ricciardo have shown similar performance levels throughout the season and are driving for competitive teams, the probability could be closer to even.

The fact that Trump was hurried off stage and appeared to be bleeding by his ear suggests a serious incident, but it does not confirm intentional gunfire.\n\nFor the question to resolve YES, there must be evidence that someone intentionally shot a bullet or bullet-like projectile at Trump.

Night Shyamalan's \"Trap\" will receive a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of at least 60%, we should consider several factors:\n\n1. **Director's Track Record**: M. Night Shyamalan is known for a mixed track record with both critically acclaimed and poorly received films. His recent films like \"Knock at the Cabin\" received a 67% score, which is above the 60% threshold. However, \"Old\" and \"Glass\" scored 50% and 37% respectively, indicating variability in critical reception.\n\n2. **Trends and Patterns**: Shyamalan's films often have a polarizing effect. The scores of his films can fluctuate widely, suggesting that while some films are well-received, others may not be. The recent positive reception of \"Knock at the Cabin\" could indicate an upward trend or improvement in his filmmaking that might continue with \"Trap\".\n\n3. **Genre and Audience Expectations**: Shyamalan is known for his unique storytelling style and plot twists, which can be a hit or miss with critics. The genre and how well it aligns with current audience and critic expectations can influence the score.\n\n4. **Marketing and Pre-release Buzz**: If \"Trap\" has a strong marketing campaign and generates positive pre-release buzz, it could positively influence critics' expectations and reviews.\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: Considering that \"Knock at the Cabin\" did achieve a \"Fresh\" score, it suggests that Shyamalan is capable of producing work that meets the threshold. However, it's important to note that his films have a tendency to divide critics, which adds uncertainty.\n\nGiven these factors, while there is potential for \"Trap\" to achieve a score of 60% or higher, the inherent unpredictability of Shyamalan's films suggests a balanced probability."}, "prob": 0.55}, "prob": 0.55, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.152, "brier_score": 0.3025, "brier_score_scaled": -21.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.7417, "calibrated_prob": 0.3909, "brier_score": 0.1528, "brier_score_scaled": 38.9, "log_score": 0.7153}}

The context provided indicates some discontent among Democrats regarding Biden's re-election prospects, with some members already publicly expressing doubts. The existence of drafts of letters and discussions behind the scenes suggests there is some momentum towards such an action. However, there are several factors to consider: 1. Political Dynamics: Publicly urging a sitting president from one's own party to drop out is a significant political move that could have repercussions for the individuals involved. This suggests that while there might be private discontent, translating that into a public and coordinated effort is a higher bar to clear. 2. Historical Precedents: Historically, it is rare for a sitting president to face such public pressure from within their own party to step down. This makes the scenario less likely unless there is a significant shift in political circumstances. 3. Timing and Coordination: The deadline is relatively close, and while there is some indication of behind-the-scenes efforts, the requirement for a coordinated and public action by a group of at least five named members adds complexity. Such actions require careful coordination and agreement, which can be difficult to achieve in a short timeframe. 4. Ambiguity and Resolution Criteria: The question specifies that the names and coordination must be clear and unambiguous. This means that even if there are reports of discontent or pressure, unless it meets the specific criteria, the market will resolve NO.

While age can be a factor in health-related concerns, there have been no public indications of severe health issues that would necessitate resignation or prevent him from fulfilling his duties. Regular medical check-ups and reports have shown him to be in good health for his age. 2. **Political Stability**: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there were no significant political scandals or pressures that would likely lead to his resignation or removal from office. The political landscape can be volatile, but the mechanisms for removing a sitting president (impeachment and conviction) are complex and require substantial bipartisan support, which is unlikely given the current political climate. 3. **Historical Precedent**: Historically, U.S. presidents typically serve their full terms unless faced with extraordinary circumstances such as severe health issues or overwhelming political pressure. Since the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, all U.S. presidents have completed their terms unless they chose not to seek re-election or were term-limited. 4. **Temporary Transfer of Power**: The question specifies that a temporary transfer of power under the 25th Amendment does not affect the resolution. This means that even if President Biden were to temporarily transfer power to the Vice President, it would not result in a NO resolution unless he permanently ceased to be president.

If the match against the US is crucial for advancement or positioning, they might field their strongest lineup, potentially reducing the number of rotations. Conversely, if they have already secured a favorable position, they might rest key players.\n\n2. **Player Fitness and Injuries**: Injuries or fitness concerns could necessitate changes in the starting lineup. If there are known injuries or players returning from injury who need rest, this could increase the likelihood of rotations.\n\n3. **Previous Rotation Patterns**: Examining Uruguay's past behavior in similar tournaments can provide insight. If the coach has a history of rotating players frequently, especially between matches with varying levels of importance, this could suggest a higher probability of rotation.\n\n4. **Squad Depth and Talent**: The availability of equally talented substitutes can also influence rotation decisions. A deep squad allows for more flexibility in resting starters without significantly impacting team performance.\n\n5. **Time Between Matches**: The time interval between the match against Panama and the match against the US can affect rotation decisions. A short turnaround might necessitate more changes to maintain player fitness.\n\nConsidering these factors and assuming Uruguay is a competitive team with a reasonable depth of talent, it is plausible that they might rotate several players to keep the squad fresh, especially if the match against the US is not critical for their progression in the tournament."}, "prob": 0.65}, "prob": 0.65, "resolution": false, "log_score": 1.5146, "brier_score": 0.4225, "brier_score_scaled": -69.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.7417, "calibrated_prob": 0.4208, "brier_score": 0.1771, "brier_score_scaled": 29.2, "log_score": 0.7879}}
