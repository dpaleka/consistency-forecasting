Given Musk's public interest in Bitcoin, I estimate a moderate probability that he will attend, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is the complement of P. If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. \n\n3. **para_P (Is it certain that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a more stringent condition and I would expect this to have a lower probability than P, perhaps around 0.30, as certainty is difficult to predict.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin, I would estimate a probability of around 0.70 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both occur: (1) Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, and (2) he makes a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: This probability would be lower than either P or Q alone, as both events need to happen. A reasonable estimate might be around 0.40.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either of the following occur: (a) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024? (b) Will he make a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: This should be higher than either P or Q alone, so I would estimate this to be around 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both occur: (a) Elon Musk makes a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024 and (b) he does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This scenario is plausible, but the probability should be moderate, say around 0.25.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will he make a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: This conditional probability should be higher than Q alone, as his attendance could increase the likelihood of making an announcement. I would estimate this to be around 0.75.\n\nOverall, I believe these estimates should respect the consistency rules, particularly the relationships between the events and their complements.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.30,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.40,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.40 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.40 / 0.75 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.30 is FALSE\n\nandor, and, or, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.30,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.30,\nP_or_Q: 0.80,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25,\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "f8fe6e55-4ca9-426b-b227-298483578e02", "title": "Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?", "body": "This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\n\n[image]", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29T12:42:14Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23T12:19:25Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-27T02:37:31.813946", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('77b0861e-8cdf-4834-a213-e075e51a0473'), title='Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('14f0df48-e68f-4899-b66f-7d49831131d1'), title='Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES, if Elon Musk does not become a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('1c0bfbdb-c45d-4da1-b50e-36c156ea03de'), title='Is it certain that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?', body='This market will conclude with a YES if Elon Musk appears as a speaker on the main stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, a significant Bitcoin conference scheduled for July 25-27, 2024.\\n\\n[image]', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 29, 12, 42, 14, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('2b7a8f98-cce8-4671-8a03-5838e433252b'), title='Will Elon Musk make a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES if Elon Musk publicly discusses Bitcoin at any event during the calendar year 2024.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_and_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('b1bf8130-2ad2-4101-bc2f-8748784236bf'), title='Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 event (2) Elon Musk makes a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?', body='This market will resolve YES if both (a) Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, one of the largest Bitcoin conferences, taking place on July 25-27, 2024, and (b) Elon Musk publicly discusses Bitcoin at any event during the calendar year 2024.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 23, 12, 19, 25, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'P_or_Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('48b443d0-e7ca-4313-8e17-97d25a4b3fb6'), title='Will either of the following occur: (a) Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?

Given his past involvement with cryptocurrency, I would estimate a moderate probability for this event occurring, say around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk does not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Since this is the complement of P, it would be 1 - P, which would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it certain that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is essentially asking for certainty. Given that there are many variables at play, I would estimate this as very low, perhaps around 0.10.\n\n4. **Q (Elon Musk makes a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024)**: Given his active engagement with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I would assign a relatively higher probability to this event, estimating it at around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occur)**: The occurrence of both events is less likely than each occurring independently. If I estimate P at 0.60 and Q at 0.70, I might calculate P_and_Q as 0.60 * 0.70 = 0.42, but I should also consider their potential dependence, which might reduce this value slightly.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. If I take P as 0.60 and Q as 0.70, and estimate P_and_Q as 0.42, then P_or_Q would be 0.60 + 0.70 - 0.42 = 0.88.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while P does not)**: This is a specific case where Q happens but P does not. If I assume that Q has a probability of 0.70 and not_P is 0.40, I might estimate this at around 0.28 (0.70 * 0.40), but again, I should consider their dependence.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P occurs)**: This conditional probability would likely be higher than the standalone Q probability, as if Musk attends the Bitcoin Nashville event, he may be more inclined to make announcements about Bitcoin. I might estimate this at around 0.80.\n\nIn summary, I will adjust my probability estimates based on these considerations, ensuring they adhere to the consistency rules. The key relationships to keep in mind are that P and not_P are complements, and P_and_Q is influenced by both P and Q.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.10,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.88 + 0.42 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.42 <= min(0.60, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.70) <= 0.88 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.88 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.42 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.10 is FALSE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2, failed_check_3, failed_check_4, failed_check_6, failed_check_7 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.10,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.42,\nP_or_Q: 0.88,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.040821994520255034, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.020410997260127517, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28837490036423613, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

Factors include his previous appearances at Bitcoin-related events and the significance of this conference.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.73, then not_P would be 0.27.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it certain that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is a stronger assertion than P, so I would expect it to be lower than P. I estimate it at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Elon Musk's active engagement with Bitcoin, I estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.70.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both occur: Musk shows up at Nashville and makes an announcement about Bitcoin?)**: This probability should be lower than either P or Q. I estimate it at 0.50, reflecting the joint occurrence.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either occur: Musk shows up at Nashville or makes an announcement about Bitcoin?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q but less than 1.

Given Musk's history with Bitcoin and similar events, I estimate a moderate to high probability of him attending, say around 0.65. \n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\n3. **para_P (Is it certain that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is slightly more stringent than P. If I believe there is a 65% chance he will attend, then I might estimate this at around 0.50, reflecting uncertainty. \n\n4. **Q (Will Elon Musk make a public announcement about Bitcoin at any event in 2024?)**: Given Musk's active presence in the cryptocurrency space, I would estimate a probability of around 0.70 for this event. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**: This is a conjunction of two events. Assuming P and Q are somewhat independent, I would calculate this as P * Q, which would be 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: This is calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. So, 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q occur and not P occur?)**: This is more complex. If Q is 0.70 and not_P is 0.35, I would estimate this at around 0.20, considering that both cannot happen if P is true. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P occurs, will Q occur?)**: This conditional probability could be high, assuming that if Musk shows up, he might also make an announcement. I might estimate this at around 0.80. \n\nAfter estimating these probabilities, I will check them against the consistency rules to ensure they align correctly. The relationships between the events are important, as they help to determine the overall probabilities and ensure that they follow the logical constraints laid out by the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.50,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.46,\nP_or_Q: 0.89,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.89 + 0.46 - 0.70 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.89 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.89 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 0.80 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.50 is FALSE\n\nneg, andor, or, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65,\nnot_P: 0.35,\npara_P: 0.65,\nQ: 0.70,\nP_and_Q: 0.46,\nP_or_Q: 0.89,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20,\nQ_given_P: 0.80\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.13107742334259087, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.06553871167129544, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.5285465537879277, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
