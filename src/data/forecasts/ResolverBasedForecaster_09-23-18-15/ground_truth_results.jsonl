During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\n\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\n\n>Tesla\u2019s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\n\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\n\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\n\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\n\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\n\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\n\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has [advised](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1) shareholders *not* to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\n\n---------------------\n\nSee related question:\n\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)"}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": {"can_resolve_question": true, "resolver_chain_of_thought": "To resolve this question, we need to check if Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) advised Tesla shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's pay package or the re-election of Kimbal Musk to the Tesla board of directors.\n    \n    1. **Elon Musk's Pay Package**: According to multiple sources, ISS recommended that Tesla shareholders vote against Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package.

Hours after polling stations closed, the head of the CNE proclaimed the incumbent, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the winner for a third term.\n\nThe opposition and the international community have pointed out irregularities. The CNE [asserted](https://mincyt.gob.ve/nicolas-maduro-gana-las-elecciones-presidenciales/), with 20% of ballots left to count, that Maduro's 7-point lead over the united opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez was \"irreversible\", which is contradictory \u2013 by the CNE's own assertion, there were enough votes left to be counted that Gonz\u00e1lez could still take the lead.\n\nFurthermore, the data published by the CNE reports no more than three numbers: the votes for Maduro (51.2% of the total), the ones for Gonz\u00e1lez (44.2%), and an aggregated figure for \"others\" (4.6%). [Analyses of the data](https://elpais.com/america/2024-08-02/quien-gano-en-venezuela-los-datos-de-la-oposicion-son-mas-verificables-que-los-oficiales.html) show that the numbers correspond *exactly* to those percentages, a result consistent with the percentages being made up and the corresponding vote counts being calculated back from them.\n\nMeanwhile, civil society in the country has been performing an [independent, bottom-up verification of the results](https://resultadosconvzla.com/); reports generated immediately after the election by the voting machines in precincts around the country are digitized and posted online. Aggregation of these vote counts show a 37-point victory for Gonz\u00e1lez over Maduro.\n\nHow will the Chavista president respond?

Release Date of One Piece Chapter 1122: According to the search results from multiple sources, One Piece Chapter 1122 was officially released on Sunday, August 4, 2024. This is crucial because it implies that the usual pattern of TCB Scans posting chapters on Thursdays or Fridays before the official release might be relevant here. 2. TCB Scans Upload Pattern: The question provides a pattern for TCB Scans' uploads, noting that chapters are usually posted on Thursdays before the official release. However, it also mentions a shift to Fridays after a Twitter account ban. 3. Specific Chapter Upload Date: The question asks if TCB Scans will upload Chapter 1122 on August 1st. Given the pattern and the official release date, we need to check if TCB Scans adhered to its usual schedule. 4. Search Results: None of the search results directly state that TCB Scans uploaded Chapter 1122 on August 1st. However, considering TCB Scans' typical upload pattern, it seems unlikely that they would deviate significantly without prior notice. 5. Evidence of Early Upload: There is no evidence in the search results that TCB Scans uploaded Chapter 1122 on August 1st. The closest evidence comes from a YouTube discussion that mentions another scanlation group, Ragnarok Scanlations, had the chapter available early, but there's no mention of TCB Scans uploading it on August 1st. Given these points, it appears that TCB Scans did not upload Chapter 1122 on August 1st, as there is no direct or indirect evidence supporting this claim.

The criteria for a new version of the Peoplemover include having portions with views above Tomorrowland and at least two specific characteristics such as using the existing Peoplemover track structure, rebuilding portions of the track on the same alignment, having a station in the old Peoplemover station building, or rebuilding the old station with similar characteristics and location.\n\n    The available information does not indicate any official announcement from Disney about a new version of the Peoplemover at D23 2024. The sources provided discuss various D23 2024 announcements and experiences but do not mention a new Peoplemover.\n\n    Given the lack of information about a new Peoplemover announcement, the question cannot be resolved affirmatively. However, since the resolution date has passed and no such announcement was made, we can conclude that the question can be resolved negatively based on the absence of relevant information.\n\n    Sources:\n    - The Walt Disney Company's D23 programming lineup and show floor activations for 2024 do not mention a new Peoplemover.\n    - The 2024 D23 Disneyland-related announcements include updates on Avatar Land and an Avengers ride but do not include a new Peoplemover.\n    - The Disney Tourist Blog mentions the Peoplemover in the context of the author's hopes but does not provide any official information about a new version being announced at D23 2024.", "answer": false}, "prob": 0.001}, "prob": 0.001, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.0014, "brier_score": 0.0, "brier_score_scaled": 100.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.4276, "calibrated_prob": 0.0496, "brier_score": 0.0025, "brier_score_scaled": 99.0, "log_score": 0.0733}}
