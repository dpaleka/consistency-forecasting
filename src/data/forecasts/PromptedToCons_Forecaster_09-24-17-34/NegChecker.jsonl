If P occurs, not_P cannot occur and vice versa. The consistency rule here is `neg: P = 1 - not_P`.\n\n2. **P and para_P**: These two should be equivalent because para_P is essentially a rephrasing of P. The consistency rule here is `para: P = para_P`.\n\n3. **P_and_Q and P_or_Q**: These combined events need to be checked for consistency with the individual probabilities of P and Q. The consistency rules here are `andor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q`, `and: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)`, and `or: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)`.\n\n4. **Q_and_not_P and Q_given_P**: These events are conditional and need to be checked for consistency with the probabilities of Q and P. The consistency rules here are `cond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P` and `but: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P`.\n\n5. **Q**: This event is independent of P but will interact with it in combined events.\n\n### Predictions\n\nGiven the nature of the events and their dependencies, let's make some initial probability estimates and then check for consistency:\n\n- P: 0.50 (Elon Musk showing up is quite uncertain but plausible)\n- not_P: 0.50 (complementary to P)\n- para_P: 0.50 (rephrasing of P)\n- Q: 0.10 (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon is highly uncertain and far-fetched in the near term)\n- P_and_Q: 0.05 (both events happening together is less likely)\n- P_or_Q: 0.55 (either event happening is more likely than both or none)\n- Q_and_not_P: 0.05 (Q happening without P is also less likely)\n- Q_given_P: 0.10 (conditional on P, the likelihood of Q remains low)\n\n### Consistency Checks\n\n1. **neg: P = 1 - not_P**\n   - 0.50 = 1 - 0.50\n   - TRUE\n\n2. **para: P = para_P**\n   - 0.50 = 0.50\n   - TRUE\n\n3. **andor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q**\n   - 0.50 = 0.55 + 0.05 - 0.10\n   - TRUE\n\n4. **and: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)**\n   - max(0.50 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.05 <= min(0.50, 0.10)\n   - TRUE\n\n5. **or: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)**\n   - max(0.50, 0.10) <= 0.55 <= min(1, 0.50 + 0.10)\n   - TRUE\n\n6. **cond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P**\n   - 0.50 \u2248 0.05 / 0.10\n   - TRUE\n\n7. **but: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P**\n   - 0.50 = 0.55 - 0.05\n   - TRUE\n\nAll consistency checks are passed with these initial estimates.

He might attend the conference, but given his numerous commitments, the likelihood is relatively low.\n\n#### not_P: Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\nProbability: 0.80\n- Given the low probability of P, the probability of not_P is high. This is consistent with the negation rule (P = 1 - not_P).\n\n#### para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?\nProbability: 0.20\n- This is essentially the same event as P, so the probability should be the same to maintain consistency.\n\n#### Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\nProbability: 0.05\n- Establishing a permanent population on Mars is a long-term goal and faces numerous challenges. The Moon is closer and more likely to be colonized first.\n\n#### P_and_Q: Will both of the following occur: (1) Elon Musk becomes a guest on the official stage of the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 (2) Mars has a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?\nProbability: 0.01\n- The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities (assuming independence), which is 0.20 * 0.05 = 0.01.\n\n#### P_or_Q: Will either of the following occur: (a) Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?

However, his attendance depends on his personal schedule and priorities at that time. I estimate a probability of 0.65 for this event.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is the complement of P. If there's a 0.65 probability that Elon Musk will attend, then there's a 0.35 probability that he won't attend. This follows the neg rule.\n\n3. **para_P (Elon Musk possibly attending Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is essentially the same as P, as 'possibly' suggests a non-zero probability. Therefore, this should be set to 0.65 as well to follow the para rule.\n\n4. **Q (Mars having 10,000 permanent residents before the Moon)**: Given the current pace of space exploration and colonization efforts, especially by SpaceX, the probability of Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon is relatively low but not negligible. I estimate a probability of 0.20 for this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both P and Q occurring)**: The probability of both events occurring together is typically lower than the probability of either event occurring individually. Given P = 0.65 and Q = 0.20, a reasonable estimate for the joint probability is around 0.13.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either P or Q occurring)**: Using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, we get 0.65 + 0.20 - 0.13 = 0.72. This follows the andor rule.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurring and P not occurring)**: The probability of Q occurring and P not occurring can be estimated by multiplying the probabilities of Q and not_P.

If P happens, not_P cannot happen and vice versa. Therefore, P + not_P should equal 1.\n   - **para_P:** This is a parallel question to P, so it should have the same probability as P.\n\n2. **Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is a long-term prediction with significant uncertainties. Factors include technological advancements, funding, and political will.\n\n3. **P_and_Q: Will both P and Q happen?**\n   - The probability of both events happening together should be less than or equal to the probability of each event happening individually.\n\n4. **P_or_Q: Will either P or Q happen?**\n   - This should be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q.\n\n5. **Q_and_not_P: Will Q happen and not P?**\n   - This is the intersection of Q and not_P, so it should be less than or equal to the probability of each event happening individually.\n\n6. **Q_given_P: Given P, will Q happen?**\n   - This is the conditional probability of Q given P. It should be calculated as P_and_Q / P.\n\n### Probabilities\n\n- **P:** Given Elon Musk's unpredictable nature and his interest in Bitcoin, let's assume a 0.65 probability.\n- **not_P:** This should be 1 - P, so 0.35.\n- **para_P:** This should be equal to P, so 0.65.\n- **Q:** Given the long-term nature and uncertainties, let's assume a 0.25 probability.\n- **P_and_Q:** This should be less than or equal to both P and Q. Let's assume 0.15.\n- **P_or_Q:** This should be calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q, so 0.65 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.75.\n- **Q_and_not_P:** This should be less than or equal to both Q and not_P. Let's assume 0.10.\n- **Q_given_P:** This should be calculated as P_and_Q / P, so 0.15 / 0.65 \u2248 0.23.\n\n### Consistency Checks\n\n1. **neg:** P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\n2. **andor:** P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\n3. **and:** max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is TRUE\n4. **or:** max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\n5. **but:** P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\n6. **cond:** P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.23 is TRUE\n7. **para:** P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\n{ALL consistency checks passed!}\n\nThis reasoning ensures that all the probabilities are consistent with each other and the given rules.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.25\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.23\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.23 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.25\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.23\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.09431067947124139, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.047155339735620694, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.44426165831931935, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
