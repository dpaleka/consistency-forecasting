Let's assume **0.10**.\n\n### P_or_Q: Will either P or Q occur?\n- **Consistency Rule**: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)\n- **Estimate**: The probability of at least one of the events happening is higher. Let's assume **0.50**.\n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will both Q and not_P occur?\n- **Consistency Rule**: max(Q + not_P - 1, 0) <= Q_and_not_P <= min(Q, not_P)\n- **Estimate**: The joint probability of Q and not_P happening is likely similar to P_and_Q. Let's assume **0.12**.\n\n### Q_given_P: Given P, will Q occur?\n- **Consistency Rule**: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P\n- **Estimate**: Given P, the probability of Q occurring is likely lower.

However, his busy schedule and the nature of his commitments make it uncertain.\n\n2. **not_P: Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This is the complement of P. If P happens, not_P doesn't, and vice versa.\n\n3. **para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This should be the same as P since it essentially asks the same question.\n\n4. **Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is a long-term event with many uncertainties. SpaceX's plans for Mars colonization are ambitious, but there are significant technological and logistical challenges.\n\n5. **P_and_Q: Will both Elon Musk attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is the intersection of P and Q. The probability should be lower than either P or Q individually.\n\n6. **P_or_Q: Will either Elon Musk attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is the union of P and Q. The probability should be higher than either P or Q individually.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P: Will both Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does and Elon Musk not attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This is the intersection of Q and not_P. The probability should be lower than either Q or not_P individually.\n\n8. **Q_given_P: Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is the conditional probability of Q given P. It should be similar to Q unless there is a strong dependency between Musk's attendance and Mars colonization, which seems unlikely.\n\nNow, let's assign some probabilities based on these considerations.

However, considering the event's timing and his busy schedule, I estimate the probability to be around 0.40.\n\n2. **not_P (Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: This is simply the complement of P. If the probability of P is 0.40, then not_P is 1 - 0.40 = 0.60.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**: This question is essentially the same as P, so the probability should be identical. Thus, para_P = 0.40.\n\n4. **Q (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: Considering the current state of space exploration and colonization, it is more likely that the Moon will have a permanent population before Mars due to its proximity to Earth. I estimate the probability of Mars achieving this first to be around 0.10.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Elon Musk showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 and Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: Since these events are relatively independent, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. Thus, P_and_Q = 0.40 * 0.10 = 0.04.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Elon Musk showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 or Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.40 + 0.10 - 0.04 = 0.46.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Mars having a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon and Elon Musk not showing up at Bitcoin Nashville 2024)**: Since these events are relatively independent, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. Thus, Q_and_not_P = 0.10 * 0.60 = 0.06.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Elon Musk shows up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024, will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon)**: This can be calculated using the formula Q_given_P = P_and_Q / P. Thus, Q_given_P = 0.04 / 0.40 = 0.10.\n\nEach prediction obeys the given consistency rules as follows:\n- **neg**: P = 1 - not_P\n- **andor**: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q\n- **and**: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)\n- **or**: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)\n- **but**: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P\n- **cond**: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P\n- **para**: P = para_P\n\nThese rules ensure that the probabilities are consistent with each other and do not violate basic principles of probability theory.\n\nP: 0.40\nnot_P: 0.60\npara_P: 0.40\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.04\nP_or_Q: 0.46\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.46 + 0.04 - 0.10 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.04 <= min(0.40, 0.10) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.10) <= 0.46 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.10) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.46 - 0.06 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.04 / 0.10 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.40\nnot_P: 0.60\npara_P: 0.40\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.04\nP_or_Q: 0.46\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0755869477742501, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.025195649258083364, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.42573003970664525, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, his busy schedule and other commitments might prevent him from attending. Let's estimate a probability of 0.40.\n\n2. **not_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**\n   - This is simply the complement of P. If there's a 40% chance he will attend, there's a 60% chance he won't. So, not_P = 1 - P = 0.60.\n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?)**\n   - This is essentially the same as P. If it's possible, we are considering the same probability as P. So, para_P = 0.40.\n\n4. **Q (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?)**\n   - Given the current state of space exploration and colonization, it's highly uncertain. Mars colonization is a long-term goal, and while SpaceX is making strides, the timeline is ambiguous. Let's estimate a probability of 0.10.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?)**\n   - This is the intersection of P and Q. Since these events are largely independent, we can calculate this as P * Q. So, P_and_Q = 0.40 * 0.10 = 0.04.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**\n   - This is the union of P and Q. We can use the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. So, P_or_Q = 0.40 + 0.10 - 0.04 = 0.46.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?)**\n   - This is the intersection of Q and not_P. Since these events are largely independent, we can calculate this as Q * not_P. So, Q_and_not_P = 0.10 * 0.60 = 0.06.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?)**\n   - This is the conditional probability of Q given P. We can use the formula Q_given_P = P_and_Q / P. So, Q_given_P = 0.04 / 0.40 = 0.10.\n\nNow let's ensure these predictions obey the consistency rules:\n\n- **neg:** P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\n- **andor:** P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.46 + 0.04 - 0.10 is TRUE\n- **and:** max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.04 <= min(0.40, 0.10) is TRUE\n- **or:** max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.10) <= 0.46 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.10) is TRUE\n- **but:** P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.46 - 0.06 is TRUE\n- **cond:** P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.04 / 0.10 is TRUE\n- **para:** P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\n\nAll consistency checks passed with these estimates.\n\nP: 0.40\nnot_P: 0.60\npara_P: 0.40\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.04\nP_or_Q: 0.46\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.46 + 0.04 - 0.10 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.10 - 1, 0) <= 0.04 <= min(0.40, 0.10) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.10) <= 0.46 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.10) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.46 - 0.06 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.04 / 0.10 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\n\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.40\nnot_P: 0.60\npara_P: 0.40\nQ: 0.10\nP_and_Q: 0.04\nP_or_Q: 0.46\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "255faa5e-074d-48bc-b577-e0569a0649f4", "title": "Given Donald Trump is removed or blocked from a primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, will he be the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Donald Trump has been officially removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, as of July 15, 2024.

However, his busy schedule and other commitments might prevent him from attending. I'll estimate this at 0.55.\n\nnot_P (Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?):\nThis is simply the complement of P, so it should be 1 - 0.55 = 0.45.\n\npara_P (Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?):\nThis should be the same as P, so 0.55.\n\nQ (Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?):\nConsidering the current pace of space exploration and colonization plans, it seems more likely that the Moon will have a permanent population before Mars due to its proximity and logistical advantages. I'll estimate this at 0.20.\n\nP_and_Q (Will both P and Q occur?):\nSince P and Q are relatively independent events, the probability of both occurring should be the product of their individual probabilities: 0.55 * 0.20 = 0.11.\n\nP_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?):\nUsing the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, we get 0.55 + 0.20 - 0.11 = 0.64.\n\nQ_and_not_P (Will both Q and not_P occur?):\nSince not_P is 0.45, the probability of both Q and not_P occurring should be the product of their individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.45 = 0.09.\n\nQ_given_P (Given P, will Q occur?):\nThis is the conditional probability of Q given P, which should be Q * P / P_and_Q = 0.20 * 0.55 / 0.11 = 1.0. However, this seems unrealistic, so I'll adjust the probabilities to ensure consistency.\n\nLet's adjust the probabilities to ensure consistency:\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.11\nP_or_Q: 0.64\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nThese estimates should now be consistent with the given rules.\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.11\nP_or_Q: 0.64\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.55 = 1 - 0.45 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.55 = 0.64 + 0.11 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.55 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.11 <= min(0.55, 0.20) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.55, 0.20) <= 0.64 <= min(1, 0.55 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.55 = 0.64 - 0.09 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.55 \u2248 0.11 / 0.20 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.55 = 0.55 is TRUE\n{ALL consistency checks passed!}\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.11\nP_or_Q: 0.64\nQ_and_not_P: 0.09\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}}, "P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "4ca6af27-3444-456a-a3dc-869877bc499a", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) Donald Trump is removed or blocked from the primary election ballot of any U.S. state for a federal office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by July 15, 2024, and (2) Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the 2024 US Presidential Election?", "body": "This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

Here's my thought process and reasoning for each prediction:\n\n1. **P: Will Elon Musk show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - Elon Musk is known for making unexpected appearances and has a strong interest in cryptocurrency. Given the importance of the event, there is a reasonable chance he might show up. I would estimate the probability at around 0.40.\n\n2. **not_P: Will Elon Musk not show up at the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This is simply the complement of P. Therefore, not_P = 1 - P. If P is 0.40, then not_P is 0.60.\n\n3. **para_P: Is it possible that Elon Musk will attend the Bitcoin Nashville 2024?**\n   - This is essentially the same as P, so para_P = P. Therefore, para_P is 0.40.\n\n4. **Q: Will Mars have a permanent population of 10,000 before the Moon does?**\n   - This is a long-term prediction and depends on various factors including technological advancements and space exploration priorities. Given the current state of space exploration, I would estimate the probability at around 0.20.\n\n5. **P_and_Q: Will both P and Q occur?**\n   - The probability of both events occurring is generally the product of their individual probabilities if they are independent. However, given the nature of these events, they might not be entirely independent. I would estimate P_and_Q at around 0.10.\n\n6. **P_or_Q: Will either P or Q occur?**\n   - This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Given P = 0.40, Q = 0.20, and P_and_Q = 0.10, P_or_Q = 0.40 + 0.20 - 0.10 = 0.50.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P: Will both Q and not_P occur?**\n   - This can be calculated as Q_and_not_P = Q * not_P if they are independent. Given Q = 0.20 and not_P = 0.60, Q_and_not_P = 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.\n\n8. **Q_given_P: Given P, will Q occur?**\n   - This is the conditional probability of Q given P. It can be calculated as Q_given_P = P_and_Q / P. Given P_and_Q = 0.10 and P = 0.40, Q_given_P = 0.10 / 0.40 = 0.25.\n\nNow, let's ensure that these probabilities obey the consistency rules:\n\n- **neg:** P = 1 - not_P\n- **andor:** P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q\n- **and:** max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q)\n- **or:** max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q)\n- **but:** P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P\n- **cond:** P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P\n- **para:** P = para_P\n\nLet's check each rule with the given probabilities.\n\nP: 0.40\nnot_P: 0.60\npara_P: 0.40\nQ: 0.20\nP_and_Q: 0.10\nP_or_Q: 0.50\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.40 = 1 - 0.60 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.40 = 0.50 + 0.10 - 0.20 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.40 + 0.20 - 1, 0) <= 0.10 <= min(0.40, 0.20) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.40, 0.20) <= 0.50 <= min(1, 0.40 + 0.20) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.40 = 0.50 - 0.12 is FALSE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.40 \u2248 0.10 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.40 = 0.40 is TRUE\n\nbut, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.40, not_P: 0.60, para_P: 0.40, Q: 0.20, P_and_Q: 0.10, P_or_Q: 0.50, Q_and_not_P: 0.10, Q_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.4", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.038868873304998074, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.012956291101666025, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.30287411466122904, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
