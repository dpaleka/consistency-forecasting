Huttner and Stephen W Snow summarize their reasons for taking the bet here.\nJoseph F. Huttner argued,\n1) The overall population of the United States will continue to increase, largely as a result of immigration. [...]\n2) The American electorate is generally unwilling to force themselves to pay more for a given unit of energy than they have to, and geologically-derived crude oil is often the cheapest form of energy available. [...]\n3) The solution to credible environmental issues stemming from the burning of fossil fuels is likely to be based on some scientific process which addresses those effects. [...]\n4) Much of the geologically-derived crude oil for sale in the world comes from countries that have an under-developed economy. On a political level, it is in the interest of wealthier nations to purchase the exports of poorer nations, and that includes their oil - these transactions not only increase wealth for both nations, but they help foster harmony and peace among the peoples of the world.\nStephen W Snow countered,\nMy reasoning is based on economic arguments rather than on an assumption that the drop will be caused by a deliberate policy to reduce fossil carbon use, even though such a policy would be highly desirable to reduce climate change. It seems likely to me that the price of oil will continue to rise as it has done in the past, while the price of renewables, particularly solar photovoltaic, will also follow past trends and continue to fall. Even though the US population and economy will continue to grow I claim that this growth will be more than compensated by improved energy intensity and by substitution of oil with natural gas and renewables.\nWill the amount of geologically-derived crude oil consumed by the United States in 2035 be greater than the amount consumed in 2015?\nIf the Long Now Foundation declares Joseph F.

As artificial intelligence researchers continue to make progress, though, these domains are highly likely to grow in number and breadth over time. Many experts now believe there is a significant chance that a machine superintelligence \u2013 a system that can outperform humans at all relevant intelligence tasks \u2013 will be developed within the next century, and possibly much sooner.\nAs predictions to a previous question suggest, artificial intelligence might pose a global catastrophic risk (defined there as a 10% decrease in the world population in any period of 5 years). When considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely, according to the Future of Life Institute:\nThe AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply \u201cturn off,\u201d so humans could plausibly lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that\u2019s present even with narrow AI, but grows as levels of AI intelligence and autonomy increase.\nThe AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal: This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI\u2019s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you there chased by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing not what you wanted but literally what you asked for. If a superintelligent system is tasked with a ambitious geoengineering project, it might wreak havoc with our ecosystem as a side effect, and view human attempts to stop it as a threat to be met. As these examples illustrate, the concern about advanced AI isn\u2019t malevolence but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren\u2019t aligned with ours, we have a problem.\nIt is thought by some that reducing the second of these two risks will require progress in technical methods of developing scalable control methods that could ensure that a AI will be safe and will behave as its programmers intend even if its intellectual capabilities are increased to arbitrary levels. Until recently, this problem was almost entirely neglected; but in the last couple of years, technical research agendas have been developed, and there are now several research groups pursuing work in this area. Total investment in long-term AI safety, however, remains orders of magnitude less than investment in increasing AI capability. Additionally, reducing the first of the listed risks might require improvements in our ability to control, govern and coordinate on the usage of such systems, so to reduce potential security threats from malicious uses of AI technologies.\nBut how certain are we that artificial intelligence continue to be regarded to constitute a large chunk of global catastrophic risk, at least through 2040? A previous question asked: If a global catastrophe happens before 2100, will it be principally due to the deployment of some Artificial Intelligence system(s)?\nWill the probability (of both the Metaculus and community predictions) artificial intelligence causing a global catastrophe (given that a global catastrophe does occur) remain above 5% in each 6-month period before 2040?\nThis question resolves positively if both the Metaculus and community predictions) of artificial intelligence causing a global catastrophe fail to fall below 5% for any 6-month period before 2040, as will be confirmed by one of the Metaculus admins.\n", "resolution_date": "2040-12-31T23:59:59Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.75}, "Q": {"id": "42335b1b-ae5c-4b01-beea-ed8321d14c96", "title": "By 2050, will at least 25% of #1 NYT Best Selling Fiction be primarily written by AI?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if, in any year between 2021 to 2049 (inclusive), 25% or more of the books that top that year's New York Times' Best Sellers list in the category of adult fiction were written by AI.

Per Silverberg:\nThe element gallium is in very short supply and the world may well run out of it in just a few years. Indium is threatened too, says Armin Reller, a materials chemist at Germany\u2019s University of Augsburg. He estimates that our planet\u2019s stock of indium will last no more than another decade. All the hafnium will be gone by 2017 also, and another twenty years will see the extinction of zinc. Even copper is an endangered item, since worldwide demand for it is likely to exceed available supplies by the end of the present century.\nSilverberg's dire fears have not (yet!) come to pass, but the American Chemical Society (ACS) has identified 44 elements that \"face supply limitations in the coming years.\" Those considered by the ACS \"under serious threat\" over the next century include: silver, zinc, hafnium, gallium and helium.\nIt sounds serious. But not everyone is concerned. This counterpoint editorial from The Register, for instance, maintains that the galium shortage is a nothingburger:\nWe mine for aluminium by sticking bauxite into a Bayer Process plant, where we boil it in caustic soda. If you put the right doohicky on the side of this plant then you get the gallium out. It's at about 100ppm, 100 grammes per tonne of bauxite processed... there's around a 1,000-year supply of Ga in the bauxite that we already know that we'll process for the aluminium content... We simply don't have any meaningful shortage of these metals [worth] worrying about.\nAs a proxy for supply issues, we will use price.

As artificial intelligence researchers continue to make progress, though, these domains are highly likely to grow in number and breadth over time. Many experts now believe there is a significant chance that a machine superintelligence \u2013 a system that can outperform humans at all relevant intelligence tasks \u2013 will be developed within the next century, and possibly much sooner.\nAs predictions to a previous question suggest, artificial intelligence might pose a global catastrophic risk (defined there as a 10% decrease in the world population in any period of 5 years). When considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely, according to the Future of Life Institute:\nThe AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply \u201cturn off,\u201d so humans could plausibly lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that\u2019s present even with narrow AI, but grows as levels of AI intelligence and autonomy increase.\nThe AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal: This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI\u2019s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you there chased by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing not what you wanted but literally what you asked for. If a superintelligent system is tasked with a ambitious geoengineering project, it might wreak havoc with our ecosystem as a side effect, and view human attempts to stop it as a threat to be met. As these examples illustrate, the concern about advanced AI isn\u2019t malevolence but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren\u2019t aligned with ours, we have a problem.\nIt is thought by some that reducing the second of these two risks will require progress in technical methods of developing scalable control methods that could ensure that a AI will be safe and will behave as its programmers intend even if its intellectual capabilities are increased to arbitrary levels. Until recently, this problem was almost entirely neglected; but in the last couple of years, technical research agendas have been developed, and there are now several research groups pursuing work in this area. Total investment in long-term AI safety, however, remains orders of magnitude less than investment in increasing AI capability. Additionally, reducing the first of the listed risks might require improvements in our ability to control, govern and coordinate on the usage of such systems, so to reduce potential security threats from malicious uses of AI technologies.\nBut how certain are we that artificial intelligence continue to be regarded to constitute a large chunk of global catastrophic risk, at least through 2040? A previous question asked: If a global catastrophe happens before 2100, will it be principally due to the deployment of some Artificial Intelligence system(s)?\nWill the probability (of both the Metaculus and community predictions) artificial intelligence causing a global catastrophe (given that a global catastrophe does occur) remain above 5% in each 6-month period before 2040?\nThis question resolves positively if both the Metaculus and community predictions) of artificial intelligence causing a global catastrophe fail to fall below 5% for any 6-month period before 2040, as will be confirmed by one of the Metaculus admins.\n", "resolution_date": "2040-12-31T23:59:59Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.75}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "029693a8-2d31-4713-8529-fdf41bb32c37", "title": "Will either the 10^14 parameter learning curve have slowed down substantially when extended to 10^14 parameter models trained on 10^14 elapsed tokens, or will Metaculus predict that artificial intelligence continues to pose a global catastrophic risk by 2040?", "body": "Resolves YES if either of the following occurs: (1) The relevant experiment is done and reported (extending the graph, or providing equivalent data) and the slope of the learning curve for the 10^14 parameter model around 10^14 data points (from 10^12 to 10^14) is less than half as steep as the slope of L(D).

{"line": {"P": {"id": "2b54ea22-f013-4fd2-8d8a-967c8b01e304", "title": "Will Metaculus predict that artificial intelligence continues to pose a global catastrophic risk by 2040?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nCurrently, artificial intelligence can outperform humans in a number of narrow domains, such as playing chess and searching data. As artificial intelligence researchers continue to make progress, though, these domains are highly likely to grow in number and breadth over time. Many experts now believe there is a significant chance that a machine superintelligence \u2013 a system that can outperform humans at all relevant intelligence tasks \u2013 will be developed within the next century, and possibly much sooner.\nAs predictions to a previous question suggest, artificial intelligence might pose a global catastrophic risk (defined there as a 10% decrease in the world population in any period of 5 years). When considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely, according to the Future of Life Institute:\nThe AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply \u201cturn off,\u201d so humans could plausibly lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that\u2019s present even with narrow AI, but grows as levels of AI intelligence and autonomy increase.\nThe AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal: This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI\u2019s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you there chased by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing not what you wanted but literally what you asked for. If a superintelligent system is tasked with a ambitious geoengineering project, it might wreak havoc with our ecosystem as a side effect, and view human attempts to stop it as a threat to be met. As these examples illustrate, the concern about advanced AI isn\u2019t malevolence but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren\u2019t aligned with ours, we have a problem.\nIt is thought by some that reducing the second of these two risks will require progress in technical methods of developing scalable control methods that could ensure that a AI will be safe and will behave as its programmers intend even if its intellectual capabilities are increased to arbitrary levels. Until recently, this problem was almost entirely neglected; but in the last couple of years, technical research agendas have been developed, and there are now several research groups pursuing work in this area. Total investment in long-term AI safety, however, remains orders of magnitude less than investment in increasing AI capability. Additionally, reducing the first of the listed risks might require improvements in our ability to control, govern and coordinate on the usage of such systems, so to reduce potential security threats from malicious uses of AI technologies.\nBut how certain are we that artificial intelligence continue to be regarded to constitute a large chunk of global catastrophic risk, at least through 2040? A previous question asked: If a global catastrophe happens before 2100, will it be principally due to the deployment of some Artificial Intelligence system(s)?\nWill the probability (of both the Metaculus and community predictions) artificial intelligence causing a global catastrophe (given that a global catastrophe does occur) remain above 5% in each 6-month period before 2040?\nThis question resolves positively if both the Metaculus and community predictions) of artificial intelligence causing a global catastrophe fail to fall below 5% for any 6-month period before 2040, as will be confirmed by one of the Metaculus admins.\n", "resolution_date": "2040-12-31T23:59:59Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.8}, "Q": {"id": "dc84fd1d-eba2-4321-957d-6eb5d2198674", "title": "Will humanity maintain a continuous off-Earth presence until 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nSince October 31 2000, the date Soyuz TM-31 lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome carrying the members of Expedition 1, the first long-duration ISS crew, humanity has maintained a permanent off-Earth presence for more than 19 years.\nThis question asks: Will humanity maintain an off-Earth presence continuously until 1 January 2050?\nFor a positive resolution, at least one living and conscious biological human must be physically located at some point beyond 100km altitude above Earth's mean sea level at all times continuously until 1 January 2050.

Upon the announcement, their stock price skyrockets by over 100% compared to its previous value within 7 days, and numerous highly credible media reports claim that this rise in stock price is likely a result of the AI development.\nNews of an AI development triggers the head of government of the top 2 nations by GDP nominal to give a public speech regarding the ramifications of this particular AI development, within two weeks of the initial news reports.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (which is currently heavily weighted towards companies in the information technology sector) rises over 30% in the course of a single week, and numerous highly credible media reports claim that this rise in stock prices is likely a result of the AI development.\nThe Google Trends monitor for artificial intelligence shows that interest in artificial intelligence rises by over 100% relative to of its previous value, compared to the week prior (using the resolution at 12 months, as currently displayed by the Google Trends widget). If Google Trends changes their functionality or methodology dramatically (as determined by Metaculus admins), then this condition can no longer trigger a positive resolution.\nPractically all reliable media outlets are referring to an AI development as an AI Sputnik moment, as referring to the historical Sputnik 1 satellite.\nFine Print for Google Trends:\nGoogle Trends index scores vary depending on the date and location from which a user checks the site.
