Continued investment in training facilities and coaching should yield high-performing athletes.\n\n2. **Historical Performance:** Historically, the USA has adapted well to different Olympic settings and has a track record of success regardless of the host country.\n\n3. **Competition Analysis:** While China is a formidable competitor, especially in sports like gymnastics, diving, and weightlifting, the margin between the two countries has been narrow. Other countries like Russia (competing as ROC in recent Olympics) and host nation France may increase their medal counts but are less likely to surpass the USA in gold medals.\n\n4. **Event Changes:** Any additions or removals of sports can impact medal opportunities.

For instance, when Great Britain hosted the 2012 Olympics, they moved up to 3rd place from 4th in 2008. Similarly, Japan, as the host nation in 2020, climbed to 3rd place from 6th in 2016.\n\nGiven that France is hosting the 2024 Paris Olympics, it's reasonable to expect an improvement in their performance.

Here is an analysis of the factors influencing the likelihood of Russian athletes being barred:\n\n1. **International Olympic Committee (IOC) Position:**\n   - The IOC has historically aimed to separate sports from politics and has often allowed athletes to compete under neutral flags when their countries face sanctions.\n   - In March 2023, the IOC recommended allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate as neutral competitors, provided they meet strict criteria, such as not actively supporting the war and not being affiliated with the military.\n\n2. **Precedents:**\n   - During the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), Russian athletes competed under the designation of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) due to doping sanctions.\n   - These precedents indicate the IOC's willingness to find compromises that allow athletes to participate while addressing broader concerns.\n\n3. **International Pressure and Responses:**\n   - Several countries and athlete groups have called for a complete ban on Russian athletes in response to the invasion of Ukraine.\n   - Ukraine and some of its allies have threatened to boycott the Olympics if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, even under a neutral flag.\n   - Despite this pressure, the IOC has emphasized the unifying power of the Olympics and the importance of not penalizing athletes for the actions of their governments.\n\n4. **Neutral Athlete Criteria:**\n   - The IOC has proposed strict eligibility criteria for Russian athletes competing as neutrals, including thorough background checks to ensure they have not supported the war or been involved in doping violations.\n   - This vetting process may limit the number of eligible athletes but is unlikely to reduce the number below 34, given Russia's large pool of elite athletes.\n\n5. **Potential Outcomes:**\n   - **Full Ban:** Unlikely, as the IOC prefers inclusion and there is precedent for allowing neutral participation.\n   - **Neutral Participation with Restrictions:** The most probable outcome, with Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag and without national symbols.\n   - **Boycotts by Other Nations:** Possible but may not significantly impact the IOC's decision unless a large number of countries participate.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the IOC's historical stance and current indications, it is likely that Russian athletes will be allowed to compete under neutral status.\n   - The number of Russian athletes competing is expected to exceed 34, as Russia typically fields a large team, and even with restrictions, many athletes may meet the eligibility criteria."}, "prob": 0.2}, "prob": 0.2, "resolution": true, "log_score": 2.3219, "brier_score": 0.64, "brier_score_scaled": -156.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.251, "brier_score": 0.561, "brier_score_scaled": -124.4, "log_score": 1.9943}}

Regulatory Environment: The EU is progressing with new regulations on artificial intelligence, such as the EU AI Act. While these regulations may impose stricter requirements on AI services, OpenAI has shown adaptability in meeting legal obligations. It's reasonable to assume that OpenAI will continue to adjust its practices to comply with new regulations to maintain access in the EU market.\n\n2.

The company has strong incentives to keep ChatGPT available to EU residents, which includes investing in compliance and addressing any legal challenges that may arise.\n\n3. Technological and Operational Factors: There are no known technological barriers that would prevent ChatGPT from being available in the EU. Operationally, OpenAI has the infrastructure to support international access.\n\n4. Political and Social Climate: While there is growing scrutiny of AI technologies, there is also recognition of their benefits. Unless there is a major incident leading to widespread bans or public outcry, it is unlikely that ChatGPT would become unavailable in over 50% of EU countries.\n\nConsidering these factors, while acknowledging the uncertainties inherent in regulatory developments and public sentiment, the probability that ChatGPT will be generally available in the European Union on June 30, 2024, is high."}, "prob": 0.85}, "prob": 0.85, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.2345, "brier_score": 0.0225, "brier_score_scaled": 91.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.4724, "brier_score": 0.2783, "brier_score_scaled": -11.3, "log_score": 1.0818}}

Some legal scholars and advocacy groups argue that his actions surrounding the Capitol riot constitute \"insurrection or rebellion,\" which could disqualify him from holding federal office.\n\nSeveral factors influence the probability of Trump being removed or blocked from any state primary ballot under this provision by July 15, 2024:\n\n1. Legal Precedent and Challenges:\n   - Historical Precedent: The use of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to disqualify a candidate has been rare and not tested in modern times, especially for a presidential candidate.\n   - Legal Challenges: Any attempt to remove Trump from a ballot would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges. The judicial process could be lengthy, potentially extending beyond the specified date.\n\n2. State Actions:\n   - State Variations: Individual states have different laws and processes for candidate qualification. Some states might be more inclined to pursue disqualification efforts, but they would need solid legal grounds.\n   - Political Considerations: State officials, especially in states with Republican leadership, may be reluctant to remove a leading candidate from the ballot without unequivocal legal justification.\n\n3. Ongoing Efforts:\n   - Advocacy Groups: As of 2023, certain groups are actively seeking to disqualify Trump using Section 3. Lawsuits have been filed in some states aiming to prevent his candidacy.\n   - Court Decisions: Early court rulings on related cases could set precedents. However, as of my last update, no court has definitively ruled on Trump's disqualification under this section.\n\n4. Timing Constraints:\n   - Legal Proceedings Duration: Given the complexity, legal proceedings might not conclude before July 15, 2024.\n   - Appeals Process: Even if a lower court rules for disqualification, appeals could stay the decision, keeping Trump on the ballot until higher courts decide.\n\n5. Reinstatement Possibility:\n   - Reinstatement Before Deadline: If Trump is removed but later reinstated before July 15, 2024, the question would resolve as \"No\" per the provided conditions.\n\nConsidering the above factors, while there is a non-zero possibility that efforts to remove Trump from a state primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment may occur, the likelihood of such removal being officially in effect on July 15, 2024, is relatively low.

This condemnation is primarily based on the alarming number of deaths and casualties stemming from the ground invasion; the growing humanitarian crisis, which has become more acute as the Israeli invasion has expanded; and the vast number of Palestinian refugees which are reportedly taking refuge in the city having fled from Northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael has already [commenced airstrikes and covert raids in Rafah](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-12/israel-conducts-strikes-in-rafah-as-humanitarian-concerns-mount), but a full-scale ground invasion has yet to commence.\n\nAmongst the nations who have condemned the plans are the US - Israel's closest ally - and Egypt - Gaza's Southern neighbour which [has threatened](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/11/egypt-threatens-to-suspend-key-peace-treaty-if-israel-pushes-into-rafah-on-its-border-officials-say.html) to break it's 45 year old peace treaty with Israel if the ground invasion plans commence in Rafah.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has continued to state that an invasion is imminent and that Israel has a specific date set, though on April 9 it [was reported](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/09/israel-defense-gallant-deny-rafah-invasion-date) that Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has said there is no date set."}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Israel and Hamas are engaged in a significant escalation of conflict following attacks by Hamas on Israeli territory. Israel has mobilized forces and initiated air strikes in the Gaza Strip, with indications of potential ground operations to dismantle Hamas's military capabilities.\n\nRafah is a city located at the southern border of the Gaza Strip, adjacent to Egypt. It is strategically important due to the presence of tunnels and smuggling routes that have been used to transport weapons and supplies into Gaza. Given Israel's objective to eliminate Hamas's infrastructure and prevent the rearmament of the group, extending ground operations to Rafah could be considered a strategic move to cut off these supply lines.\n\nHowever, several factors might influence this decision:\n\n1. **International Pressure:** There is significant international concern regarding civilian casualties and humanitarian conditions in Gaza. Expanding military operations to densely populated areas like Rafah could exacerbate these concerns and lead to increased diplomatic pressure on Israel to restrain its military actions.\n\n2. **Egypt's Role:** Rafah borders Egypt, and any military activity near the Egyptian border could strain Israel-Egypt relations. Egypt has been a mediator in previous conflicts and may oppose extensive military operations in Rafah to prevent destabilization along its border.\n\n3. **Operational Challenges:** Urban warfare in densely populated cities poses significant risks to military personnel and civilians. The Israeli Defense Forces may weigh these risks against the strategic benefits of operating in Rafah.\n\nConsidering the time frame until June 1, 2024, there is ample time for the situation to evolve. If the conflict persists and Israel remains committed to dismantling Hamas's capabilities comprehensively, it is plausible that ground operations could extend to Rafah.

However, the Eurovision landscape has changed considerably since their last participation. Several factors influence the likelihood of Luxembourg qualifying for the Grand Final: 1. Experience Gap: Being absent for over three decades means Luxembourg might lack the recent experience and insights that continuous participants have gained. This includes understanding current voting patterns, staging expectations, and audience preferences. 2. Competition Level: The number of participating countries has increased, leading to more competitive semi-finals. Newer countries and those with a strong track record in recent years may have an advantage. 3. Unknown Artist and Song: As of October 2023, there is no public information about the artist or song that will represent Luxembourg. Without details on the song's genre, appeal, and the artist's popularity, it's challenging to assess their potential impact. 4. Voting Dynamics: Eurovision's voting system combines jury and public votes, which can be unpredictable. Returning countries sometimes generate buzz, which could work in Luxembourg's favor. However, they may also struggle to secure diaspora or neighbor votes compared to other nations. 5. Historical Success: Luxembourg's past victories demonstrate their capability to perform well.

This bridge holds significant strategic and symbolic importance for Russia.\n\nIn October 2022, the bridge sustained damage from an explosion, which was attributed to Ukrainian forces by Russian officials, although Ukraine did not claim responsibility. This incident highlighted the bridge as a vulnerable and high-value target in the conflict.\n\nSeveral factors influence the likelihood of the bridge being attacked again before July 1, 2024:\n\n1. **Continuation of Hostilities**: If the conflict persists into mid-2024, Ukrainian forces may seek to disrupt Russian supply lines to weaken their military operations in occupied territories, making the bridge a logical target.\n\n2. **Military Capabilities**: Ukraine has been receiving military support from Western nations, potentially enhancing their ability to conduct long-range or covert operations against strategic targets like the bridge.\n\n3. **Russian Defenses**: Following previous attacks, Russia has likely increased security measures around the bridge, including enhanced air defenses and surveillance, which could deter or prevent successful attacks.\n\n4. **International Influence**: Diplomatic efforts, sanctions, and international pressure could either escalate or de-escalate the conflict, affecting the probability of such attacks.\n\n5. **Strategic Priorities**: Ukraine must balance the benefits of attacking the bridge against potential repercussions, such as escalation of conflict or civilian casualties.\n\nGiven these considerations, there is a moderate likelihood that the bridge could be targeted within the specified timeframe.

Negotiation Progress: The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) has been holding sessions to draft and negotiate the agreement's terms. Progress reports suggest that while there is general consensus on the need for such an agreement, key provisions are still under negotiation. 2.

Resolving these differences is crucial for approval. 3. Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing geopolitical tensions, especially between major powers, could hinder consensus. Disagreements on unrelated international issues might spill over into WHO negotiations. 4. Historical Precedents: Historically, international agreements of this magnitude (e.g., the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) have taken several years to negotiate and ratify. Completing the process by May 2024 would be ambitious. 5. Urgency and Political Will: The recent memory of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a sense of urgency.

Carvalho, an official with UN Environment Programme in Nairobi, was likewise put forth by Brazil\u2019s delegate in March.\n\nNotably, the UK was a signatory of a [memorandum](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-supports-moratorium-on-deep-sea-mining-to-protect-ocean-and-marine-ecosystems) against DSM. However, as noted in the above article, Lodge has found support of island nations - such as Kiribati - who stand to benefit immensely from DSM.\n\nOne DSM company - [The Metals Company (TMC)](https://metals.co) - has been a major supporter of DSM and has carried out extensive environmental studies supporting its position of allowing the practice.

The ISA's regulations do not explicitly state a term limit for the Secretary-General position, which suggests that serving more than two terms is possible if the member states support the candidate.\n\nSeveral factors influence the likelihood of Michael Lodge being re-elected for a third term:\n\n1. **Incumbency Advantage:** As the current Secretary-General, Lodge has the advantage of experience and established relationships with member states. If he has performed satisfactorily and promoted the ISA's objectives, this could favor his re-election.\n\n2. **Performance Record:** Lodge has been involved in advancing the framework for deep-sea mining regulations. Support from countries interested in exploiting seabed resources may bolster his candidacy. However, environmental concerns about deep-sea mining have been rising, and opposition from environmental groups and some member states could impact perceptions of his leadership.\n\n3. **Member States\u2019 Interests:** The ISA comprises various member states with differing priorities.

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\n\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\n\n>Tesla\u2019s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\n\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\n\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\n\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\n\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\n\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\n\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has [advised](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1) shareholders *not* to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\n\n---------------------\n\nSee related question:\n\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)"}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has a history of scrutinizing executive compensation packages and board compositions for companies.

Given the ongoing scrutiny and potential concerns about the incentive structure of Musk's compensation, there is a reasonable chance that ISS might advise shareholders to vote against it at the 2024 Tesla shareholder meeting.\n\nRegarding Kimbal Musk, he is Elon Musk's brother and serves on Tesla's board of directors.

The surge in demand for AI applications and data center technologies has bolstered Nvidia's market position. **Factors to Consider**: 1. **Growth Potential for Nvidia**: - **AI and Machine Learning Demand**: If the demand for AI technology continues to grow exponentially, Nvidia could see significant revenue increases. - **Product Innovation**: Breakthroughs in GPU technology or new product lines could further enhance Nvidia's market position. - **Market Expansion**: Entry into new markets or successful acquisitions could propel growth. 2. **Apple's Market Dynamics**: - **Product Saturation**: The smartphone market is highly saturated; significant growth may be challenging. - **Innovation Pace**: Without groundbreaking new products, Apple's growth may slow. - **Regulatory Challenges**: Antitrust regulations or supply chain issues could impact Apple's performance. 3. **Economic Conditions**: - **Market Volatility**: Economic downturns could affect tech stocks differently. - **Investor Sentiment**: Shifts in investment trends towards AI could favor Nvidia. **Assessment**: - **Likelihood of Nvidia Surpassing Apple**: For Nvidia's market cap to exceed Apple's by July 17, 2024, Nvidia would need to more than double its market cap (assuming Apple's remains stable), which is a substantial increase in less than a year. - **Apple's Stability**: Apple's diversified portfolio and strong financials make a significant decline in market cap less likely in the short term. - **Potential Scenarios**: While it's possible that Nvidia continues its rapid growth trajectory, surpassing Apple would require exceptional circumstances, such as revolutionary advancements or significant market shifts. **Conclusion**: Given the current information and market trends, while Nvidia is positioned for growth, the probability of it surpassing Apple's market capitalization by July 17, 2024, is relatively low but not negligible."}, "prob": 0.15}, "prob": 0.15, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.2345, "brier_score": 0.0225, "brier_score_scaled": 91.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.2161, "brier_score": 0.0467, "brier_score_scaled": 81.3, "log_score": 0.3512}}

A Kp value greater than 4 signifies the onset of geomagnetic storm conditions. Specifically: - Kp = 5 corresponds to a minor geomagnetic storm (G1). - Kp = 6 corresponds to a moderate geomagnetic storm (G2). Geomagnetic storms are primarily driven by solar activity, which follows an approximately 11-year solar cycle consisting of solar minimum and solar maximum phases. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Solar Cycle 25 is underway, with the solar maximum expected around 2025. This means that in July 2024, solar activity is increasing, approaching the peak activity of the solar cycle. Historical Frequency: During periods nearing solar maximum, the frequency of geomagnetic storms increases. Historical data indicates: - Minor storms (Kp = 5): Occur approximately 100 times per year during solar maximum phases. - Moderate storms (Kp = 6): Occur about 35 times per year during active solar periods. Combined, there are roughly 135 events per year with Kp values greater than 4 and less than or equal to 6. Over a 365-day year, this averages to about one such event every 2.7 days.

For example, Michael Phelps won a record-breaking eight gold medals in a single Olympics (Beijing 2008), and swimmers like Katie Ledecky and Caeleb Dressel have also won multiple golds in recent Games.\n\nAt the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, American swimmer Caeleb Dressel won five gold medals, making him the athlete with the most golds at those Games. Australian swimmer Emma McKeon also had a standout performance, winning four gold and three bronze medals. Their success highlights the potential for swimmers to dominate the medal tally.\n\nLooking ahead to the 2024 Paris Olympics, it is likely that top swimmers will again be strong contenders for the highest number of gold medals. Swimmers like Caeleb Dressel and Katie Ledecky (if they compete) are expected to participate in multiple events.

Night Shyamalan is a well-known director with a track record of both highly successful and moderately performing films at the box office.

This film was an original story with a moderate marketing campaign. 2. **\"Old\" (2021)**: Opened to approximately **$16.85 million** domestically. Also an original film, it faced pandemic-related box office impacts. 3. **\"Glass\" (2019)**: Opened to around **$40.3 million** domestically. This film was part of a well-received trilogy, following \"Unbreakable\" and \"Split,\" which boosted audience interest. 4. **\"Split\" (2017)**: Had an opening weekend of about **$40 million** domestically. Its success was partly due to strong reviews and the surprise connection to \"Unbreakable.\" From these data points, we observe that standalone original films like \"Old\" and \"Knock at the Cabin\" tend to open below $20 million, while films connected to a popular franchise, such as \"Split\" and \"Glass,\" perform significantly better. Factors to consider for \"Trap\": - **Franchise Connection**: If \"Trap\" is a standalone film without connections to previous works, it may perform similarly to \"Old\" and \"Knock at the Cabin.\" - **Star Power**: The presence of high-profile actors can boost opening weekend numbers. Information on the cast as of October 2023 is limited. - **Marketing and Hype**: A strong marketing campaign and positive pre-release buzz can elevate box office performance. - **Release Timing**: Releasing during a weekend with little competition can help. However, August often sees the release of major summer films.

Here are the factors influencing the probability of her winning a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games: 1. Recent Performance: - 2023 World Championships: Richardson won the gold medal in the women's 100 meters at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest. This victory demonstrates her ability to compete and win against the world's best, including top contenders from Jamaica like Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson. - Consistency: Throughout the 2023 season, Richardson has shown consistent performance with several sub-10.80 times, indicating her peak form. 2. Competition: - Jamaican Sprinters: The Jamaican athletes, particularly Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson, and Elaine Thompson-Herah, remain strong competitors. They've historically dominated the sprint events and are likely to be major contenders in Paris. - Emerging Talent: New athletes may emerge in the months leading up to the Olympics, adding to the competition. 3. Relay Events: - 4x100m Relay: Richardson may be part of the U.S. women's 4x100m relay team. The U.S. team is traditionally strong but has faced stiff competition from Jamaica and has occasionally been plagued by baton exchange issues. - Team Selection: Final relay team selections are often made close to the event, and performance at the U.S. Olympic Trials will be crucial. 4. Injury and Fitness: - Health Risks: Sprinting is high-intensity and has a risk of injuries which can occur unexpectedly and impact performance. - Training and Preparation: How Richardson manages her training and stays injury-free will significantly affect her chances. 5. Psychological Factors: - Pressure of the Olympics: The Olympics bring immense pressure. Richardson missed the Tokyo 2020 Olympics due to a suspension, so Paris 2024 will be her Olympic debut. - Mental Readiness: Her ability to handle the Olympic spotlight will be crucial. 6. Historical Context: - U.S. Women's Sprinting: The last American woman to win Olympic gold in the 100m was Gail Devers in 1996. Breaking this long drought adds both motivation and pressure. **Probability Calculation:** - Probability of Winning 100m Gold: Considering her form and competition, estimated at 40%. - Probability of Winning 200m Gold: Given stronger competitors and her performance, estimated at 15%. - Probability of Winning Relay Gold: Accounting for team dynamics and competition, estimated at 35%. - Combined Probability: The chance of her winning at least one gold medal can be calculated using the complement rule. Calculating the probability that she does not win any gold: - P(No Gold) = (1 - 0.40) * (1 - 0.15) * (1 - 0.35) = 0.60 * 0.85 * 0.65 \u2248 0.3315 Therefore, the probability that she wins at least one gold medal is: - 1 - P(No Gold) = 1 - 0.3315 = 0.6685 **Conclusion:** Taking into account all these factors, I estimate the probability of Sha'Carri Richardson winning a gold medal in any event at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games to be approximately 67%."}, "prob": 0.67}, "prob": 0.67, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.5778, "brier_score": 0.1089, "brier_score_scaled": 56.44, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.4324, "brier_score": 0.3222, "brier_score_scaled": -28.9, "log_score": 1.2095}}

The film will feature Ryan Reynolds reprising his role as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine. This crossover is highly anticipated by fans and is significant because it brings together two of the most popular characters in the Marvel universe, especially with Wolverine returning after what was thought to be his final appearance in \"Logan\" (2017).\n\nThe previous record for the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie is held by \"Deadpool\" (2016), which grossed approximately $284.5 million globally in its opening weekend, including $152.2 million domestically. The success of the original \"Deadpool\" was attributed to its fresh take on the superhero genre, effective marketing, and strong fan support.\n\nSeveral factors suggest that \"Deadpool 3\" could surpass this record:\n\n1. **Star Power and Crossover Appeal:** The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine in a single film is a significant draw. Hugh Jackman's return as Wolverine is a major event that can attract both Deadpool fans and long-time X-Men enthusiasts.\n\n2. **Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Integration:** With Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Deadpool is now part of the MCU. This integration can lead to a wider audience reach, as MCU films tend to perform exceptionally well at the box office.\n\n3. **Marketing and Hype:** Given the novelty of the crossover and the surprise return of Hugh Jackman, the marketing campaign is likely to be robust and generate substantial buzz leading up to the release.\n\n4. **Pent-Up Demand:** The delays and disruptions in film releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased anticipation for major blockbuster films.\n\nHowever, there are factors that could potentially limit the box office performance:\n\n1. **R-Rating Constraints:** Being R-rated restricts younger audiences from attending, which can cap the maximum potential audience compared to PG-13 MCU films.\n\n2. **Market Competition:** The film's release timing may coincide with other major releases in 2024, which could split the audience.\n\n3. **Economic Factors:** Global economic conditions can affect consumer spending on entertainment, potentially impacting box office revenues.\n\n4. **Franchise Fatigue:** There's a possibility, albeit small, that audiences might feel fatigued with superhero films, although strong performances of recent superhero movies suggest this is not yet a significant issue.\n\nConsidering these factors, the strong positives outweigh the potential negatives.

Health and Age: President Biden was born on November 20, 1942, which means he will be 81 years old by July 2024. While age can be a factor in health, there have been no major public reports of health issues that would prevent him from fulfilling his duties.

As of now, there are no significant movements or indications that such actions are likely to occur before July 2024. 3. Historical Precedent: It is relatively rare for a sitting U.S. president not to complete their term. Only a handful of presidents have left office early due to assassination, natural death, or resignation. 4. Political Climate: While political tensions exist, there is no current evidence to suggest an imminent threat to President Biden's presidency in terms of legality or governance that would result in him leaving office before the specified date. 5. Unforeseen Events: While it's impossible to predict unforeseen circumstances with absolute certainty (e.g., sudden health issues, unforeseen political events), the probability of such events occurring within the specified timeframe is low. Considering all these factors, it is highly probable that Joe Biden will still be the president of the United States at 11:59 pm on July 31, 2024."}, "prob": 0.95}, "prob": 0.95, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.074, "brier_score": 0.0025, "brier_score_scaled": 99.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.4913, "brier_score": 0.2588, "brier_score_scaled": -3.5, "log_score": 1.0254}}

Distance runners often maintain their competitive edge into their early to mid-30s, so age is unlikely to be a significant detriment. However, there are factors that could impact her chances:\n\n1. **Competition**: The fields in the middle and long-distance events are highly competitive. Athletes like Faith Kipyegon, Gudaf Tsegay, and Letesenbet Gidey are strong contenders who have produced world-record performances recently.\n\n2. **Injury Risk**: As with any elite athlete, there is always a risk of injury that could affect her training or prevent her from competing.\n\n3. **Event Selection**: It's uncertain which events Hassan will choose to focus on. Competing in multiple events can be physically demanding and might affect her performance.\n\n4. **Performance Fluctuations**: Athletic performance can vary due to factors like form, fitness level, and psychological factors.\n\nConsidering her track record, current form, and experience, Hassan has a strong probability of winning at least one medal at the Paris Olympics.

This initiative seeks to increase housing supply and affordability by encouraging the development of medium-density housing.\n\nThe political climate in Berkeley is progressive, with a strong focus on social justice and addressing inequality, including housing affordability. There is significant support for increasing housing density among certain council members, housing advocates, and segments of the community concerned about displacement and high housing costs.\n\nHowever, zoning changes, especially those altering neighborhood character, often face substantial opposition from community members worried about increased density, traffic, parking, and the preservation of historical neighborhoods. Public hearings on such ordinances can be lengthy, and strong opposition can lead to delays, amendments, or tabling of proposals.\n\nConsidering the specifics of the resolution criteria:\n\n- Resolves YES if the ordinance is passed at the July 23 meeting (even if watered down or after midnight on July 24).\n- Resolves NO if the vote is continued to a future meeting or if the ordinance is voted down.\n\nGiven the contentious nature of zoning reforms, there is a significant possibility that the council may not reach a consensus by the July 23 meeting.

These breaks can affect the chapter numbering and release dates, making it tricky to predict the exact chapter that will be released on a specific date months in advance.\n\n2. **Chapter Progression**: As of my last update in October 2023, One Piece was around chapter 1094. Assuming a roughly weekly release schedule with intermittent breaks, reaching chapter 1122 by August 1st, 2024, is plausible but not certain. There may be delays or additional breaks that could push this chapter earlier or later.\n\n3. **Recent Trends with TCB Scans**: It's noted that after a Twitter account ban, TCB Scans started posting on Fridays. While they've returned to Thursdays for recent chapters, there's a possibility of schedule changes in the future.\n\nGiven these considerations, while there's a good chance that chapter 1122 could be released on August 1st, 2024, uncertainties in the manga's release schedule and external factors affecting TCB Scans' posting habits introduce some doubt."}, "prob": 0.65}, "prob": 0.65, "resolution": true, "log_score": 0.6215, "brier_score": 0.1225, "brier_score_scaled": 51.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.4274, "brier_score": 0.3279, "brier_score_scaled": -31.2, "log_score": 1.2265}}

Historically, Disney often uses the D23 Expo, held biennially, as a platform to announce major new attractions, shows, and entertainment offerings. The next D23 Expo is scheduled for 2024, making it a prime opportunity for significant announcements. The Magic Kingdom has been without a regular nighttime parade since the 'Main Street Electrical Parade' departed in 2016. Since then, guests and fans have expressed a strong desire for the return of a nighttime parade to the park. The absence of such an offering creates a gap in the park's nighttime entertainment lineup, which currently relies heavily on fireworks shows like 'Happily Ever After.' Additionally, Disney continuously seeks to enhance guest experiences and drive attendance, especially in competitive markets and periods. Introducing a new nighttime parade could serve as a major draw for visitors and generate renewed interest in the Magic Kingdom. However, there are factors that might make this announcement less likely: 1. Resource Allocation: Disney has been investing in other areas, such as the development of new attractions (e.g., 'Tron Lightcycle Run') and updates to existing ones. Budgetary constraints or strategic priorities might delay the introduction of a new parade. 2. Operational Challenges: Nighttime parades require significant operational support, including cast members, maintenance, and crowd management, which might be challenging to implement. 3. No Strong Rumors: As of October 2023, there are no credible leaks or strong rumors suggesting that a new nighttime parade is in development for the Magic Kingdom.

The Republican National Convention is scheduled for July 15\u201318, 2024, concluding just one day before the date in question. Historically, presidential candidates often receive a 'convention bounce'\u2014a temporary increase in polling and public support\u2014immediately following their party's convention due to heightened media attention and positive messaging.\n\nFiveThirtyEight's election forecast model incorporates a variety of factors, including national and state polls, economic indicators, historical voting patterns, and other predictive variables. The model aims to provide a probabilistic assessment of each candidate's chances of winning the election.\n\nGiven the timing of the Republican National Convention ending on July 18, 2024, it is likely that Donald Trump (if he is the nominee) may experience a post-convention boost in both polls and predictive models. Conversely, the Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19\u201322, 2024, meaning Joe Biden would not receive a similar convention-related increase until later.\n\nAdditionally, incumbent presidents typically have certain advantages, but as of 2023, Joe Biden's approval ratings are moderate, and various national issues such as the economy, foreign policy, and domestic concerns could impact voter sentiment. Economic conditions and other unforeseen events in the intervening months could sway public opinion in favor of either candidate.\n\nConsidering the potential for a convention bump favoring Trump immediately after the Republican convention, and the absence of a corresponding boost for Biden until later, there is a plausible scenario where FiveThirtyEight's model projects Trump as the favorite on July 19, 2024. However, the inherent uncertainties in election forecasting, especially so far in advance, make precise predictions difficult."}, "prob": 0.4}, "prob": 0.4, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.737, "brier_score": 0.16, "brier_score_scaled": 36.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.3492, "brier_score": 0.122, "brier_score_scaled": 51.2, "log_score": 0.6198}}

These injuries have caused him to miss several tournaments or withdraw partway through others.\n\nIn 2022 and early 2023, Terunofuji had to sit out of several tournaments to recover from knee surgery. His participation has been intermittent due to his ongoing health concerns. Given his age (he was born in November 1991, making him nearly 33 by July 2024) and the physical demands of sumo at the Yokozuna level, the likelihood of sustaining further injuries or experiencing complications is relatively high.\n\nPredicting his participation in all 15 matches of the 2024 July Grand Sumo Tournament (Nagoya basho) involves considering:\n\n1. Injury Recovery and Management: Terunofuji's ability to manage his injuries and recover sufficiently to compete at the highest level consistently.\n2. Physical Condition: The cumulative toll of past injuries may affect his stamina and resilience during the tournament.\n3. Potential for New Injuries: The risk of new injuries increases with age and existing health issues.\n4. Competition Schedule: The demanding schedule may compel him to rest or withdraw to prevent exacerbating injuries.\n5. Retirement Possibility: There is a possibility that he may choose to retire before July 2024, especially if health issues persist.\n\nGiven these factors, while it's possible that Terunofuji will participate fully, there is a significant chance that he may miss one or more matches due to health concerns."}, "prob": 0.3}, "prob": 0.3, "resolution": true, "log_score": 1.737, "brier_score": 0.49, "brier_score_scaled": -96.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.3062, "brier_score": 0.4813, "brier_score_scaled": -92.5, "log_score": 1.7074}}

Conversely, if the economy remains stable or improves, demand for silver as a hedge might decrease.\n\n3. **Industrial Demand**: Silver is used extensively in electronics, solar panels, and medical devices. Growth in these industries, especially with the push for renewable energy, could increase demand and support higher prices.\n\n4. **Inflation and Monetary Policy**: Persistently high inflation could lead to increased demand for precious metals. Central banks' policies on interest rates will also influence silver prices; lower interest rates tend to support higher precious metal prices.\n\n5. **Geopolitical Tensions**: Escalation in geopolitical conflicts can drive investors toward safe-haven assets, potentially boosting silver prices.\n\n6. **Market Speculation**: Trends driven by investor sentiment and speculative trading can cause significant short-term price movements.\n\nGiven the need for a substantial price increase from typical trading ranges to surpass $30.50, and considering the absence of any specific events or trends indicating a significant price surge by August 2024, it seems moderately unlikely that silver will close above that threshold on the specified date and time."}, "prob": 0.3}, "prob": 0.3, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.5146, "brier_score": 0.09, "brier_score_scaled": 64.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.3062, "brier_score": 0.0938, "brier_score_scaled": 62.5, "log_score": 0.5274}}

During these matches, there were no red cards issued.\n   - **World Cup Semi-finals**: Looking at the FIFA World Cup semi-finals from 2006 to 2018 (four tournaments, totaling 8 matches), there was only one red card (in 2010, Uruguay vs. Netherlands).\n\n2. **Incidence Rate**:\n   - **Low Frequency**: The data suggests that red cards are relatively rare in semi-final matches of major tournaments. Players are often more disciplined due to the high stakes, and referees may exercise caution to avoid influencing the game decisively unless absolutely necessary.\n   - **Estimated Probability per Match**: Given the rarity, we might estimate the probability of a red card in a semi-final match to be around 5%.\n\n3. **Cumulative Probability for Two Matches**:\n   - **Calculating for Both Matches**: The probability of at least one red card in either of the two matches can be calculated using the complement rule.\n   - **No Red Card in Both Matches**: The probability of no red cards in a single match is 95% (0.95).

The primary factors that could prevent him from remaining in office are health-related issues due to his age, resignation, or removal from office through impeachment.\n\n1. **Health Risks**: For an 81-year-old male, the annual mortality rate is approximately 7%. Over the span of approximately 9.5 months (from mid-October 2023 to the end of July 2024), the mortality risk is slightly less than that. This suggests a roughly 5-6% chance of mortality within that period.\n\n2. **Resignation**: There have been no significant indications that President Biden intends to resign. Historically, it's rare for U.S. presidents to resign; the only instance being Richard Nixon in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal. Given the absence of comparable circumstances, the probability of resignation is low.\n\n3. **Impeachment and Removal**: While any president can face impeachment proceedings, actual removal from office is rare and requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate. As of October 2023, the political composition of Congress and lack of major scandals make this outcome unlikely.\n\n4. **25th Amendment Transfer of Power**: Temporary transfers of power under the 25th Amendment (e.g., for medical procedures) do not affect the resolution of this question, as they do not constitute a cessation of the presidency.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most significant risk is health-related.

The absence of any such indications reduces the likelihood of an announcement about the PeopleMover.\n\nWhile it's possible that Disney could surprise fans with an unexpected announcement at D23 2024, the lack of evidence makes it unlikely."}, "prob": 0.1}, "prob": 0.1, "resolution": false, "log_score": 0.152, "brier_score": 0.01, "brier_score_scaled": 96.0, "platt": {"factor": 0.6793, "calibrated_prob": 0.1731, "brier_score": 0.0299, "brier_score_scaled": 88.0, "log_score": 0.2741}}
