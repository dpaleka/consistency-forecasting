Given the increasing scrutiny on AI safety, I estimate this probability to be 0.60. \n\nnot_P: Conversely, the probability that OpenAI will publish such a report is thus 1 - P, which calculates to 0.40. \n\npara_P: This question is essentially a paraphrase of P, so I expect it to have the same probability, which is also 0.60. \n\nQ: The question regarding whether the US will conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030 is highly uncertain. Given the current geopolitical climate, I estimate this probability at 0.20. \n\nP_and_Q: The joint probability that both OpenAI does not publish a report and the US conducts a nuclear test can be calculated as the product of their individual probabilities, assuming independence: 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12. \n\nP_or_Q: The probability that either event occurs can be calculated using the formula P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, it is 0.60 + 0.20 - 0.12 = 0.68. \n\nQ_and_not_P: The probability that the US conducts a nuclear test while OpenAI publishes a report can be calculated as Q * not_P, which would be 0.20 * 0.40 = 0.08. \n\nQ_given_P: Given that OpenAI does not publish a report, the probability of the US conducting a nuclear test may slightly increase due to reduced oversight or scrutiny, so I estimate this to be 0.25. \n\nOverall, the probabilities are interrelated, and changing one probability will affect others, especially in the context of the consistency rules.

This reflects a belief that OpenAI may choose to publish such a report given the increasing scrutiny and interest in AI safety, but there is still a reasonable chance they may not due to various reasons such as strategic considerations or potential negative findings.\n\nnot_P: This is the direct complement of P, so I would estimate not_P at 0.40. This means there is a 40% chance that OpenAI will publish the report by the deadline.\n\npara_P: This question is essentially rephrasing P, so I would also estimate para_P at 0.60, reflecting the same reasoning.\n\nQ: For the question about the US conducting a nuclear test explosion before 2030, I would estimate this probability at 0.25. This reflects the current geopolitical climate and the historical context of nuclear testing, where the US has not conducted tests in many years, but there are still some tensions that could lead to such an action.\n\nP_and_Q: Since P and Q are independent events, I would calculate this as P * Q = 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15. This reflects the joint probability of both events occurring.\n\nP_or_Q: To calculate this, I would use the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q = 0.60 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.70. This reflects the likelihood that either OpenAI does not publish the report or the US conducts a nuclear test.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This question combines the occurrence of Q with the non-occurrence of P. Assuming independence again, I would estimate this as Q * not_P = 0.25 * 0.40 = 0.10. This reflects the probability of a nuclear test occurring while OpenAI publishes the report.\n\nQ_given_P: Given that OpenAI does not publish the report, I would still estimate the likelihood of a nuclear test at 0.25, as the two events are independent. This would suggest a slight downward adjustment based on the context, so I would estimate this at 0.20.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.15,\nP_or_Q: 0.70,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.70 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.25) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.70 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.20 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.25,\nP_and_Q: 0.10,\nP_or_Q: 0.75,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10,\nQ_given_P: 0.20\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}, "not_P": {"question": {"id": "952c295b-bf5e-4aeb-8cb7-5b6c5ccab7d0", "title": "Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-02T05:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2023-07-24T22:53:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.6, "metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-25T02:05:51.627109", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('ada6364c-9d84-4e15-adf0-61bbc7fddeec'), title='Will OpenAI not publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI does not publish a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d3b0e49a-0ccc-4e21-bb39-f8a974d7f93f'), title='Will OpenAI publish a report with results from external red-teaming of their models for safety by June 30, 2024?', body='This question resolves as **YES** if, by June 30, 2024, OpenAI publishes a *public* report with the results from an *external* party red-teaming the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('797e5e98-b9d9-4298-88ea-905fdeba1cd8'), title='Is it possible that OpenAI will refrain from releasing a report detailing results from outside red-teaming of their models concerning safety before June 30, 2024?', body='This question will be considered **YES** if, on or before June 30, 2024, OpenAI fails to issue a *public* report that includes the findings from an *external* entity assessing the safety of one of their AI models.', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 7, 2, 5, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 24, 22, 53, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('11e57f21-15be-45fe-9a8f-dc8b01441841'), title='Will the US conduct a nuclear test explosion before 2030?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve positively to verification of a nuclear explosion by the CTBTO, the UN, or if an official government statement from the US is issued confirming the test.

However, generally we live in a peaceful and interconnected world where people want to generally avoid war.  Accounting for these assumptions, I would guess 0.33\nP_and_Q: I think that these two events (US topping the Paris olympics and a US - China armed conflict leading to 100 deaths) are mostly independent events.  Therefore we can intially guesss this as P * Q = 0.73 * 0.33 = 0.24.  However, perhaps there is some negative correlation with these events where if the US does not top the medal count, China could perceive the country as a little weaker and therefore more likely to provoke militarily.

Given the increasing scrutiny on AI safety and transparency, I estimate the probability at 0.60. \n\nnot_P: Conversely, if I believe that the probability of OpenAI not publishing is 0.60, then the probability of them publishing the report is 0.40. \n\npara_P: The question regarding whether it is possible for OpenAI to refrain from releasing a report is somewhat redundant given the previous estimates. I would align this probability closely with P, so I estimate it at 0.60 as well. \n\nQ: The likelihood of the US conducting a nuclear test explosion before 2030 is quite low, considering the current international climate and the treaties in place. I estimate this probability at 0.15. \n\nP_and_Q: Since P and Q are likely independent events, the probability of both occurring can be calculated as P * Q = 0.60 * 0.15 = 0.09. \n\nP_or_Q: For the probability of either event occurring, I can use the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. This gives us 0.60 + 0.15 - 0.09 = 0.66. \n\nQ_and_not_P: For this probability, I will calculate it as Q * not_P, which is 0.15 * 0.40 = 0.06. \n\nQ_given_P: Given that OpenAI does not publish a report, I still believe the US's likelihood of conducting a nuclear test remains the same, so I would estimate this probability at 0.15.\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.15,\nP_and_Q: 0.09,\nP_or_Q: 0.66,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06,\nQ_given_P: 0.15\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.66 + 0.09 - 0.15 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.15 - 1, 0) <= 0.09 <= min(0.60, 0.15) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.15) <= 0.66 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.15) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.66 - 0.06 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.09 / 0.15 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60,\nnot_P: 0.40,\npara_P: 0.60,\nQ: 0.10,\nP_and_Q: 0.06,\nP_or_Q: 0.64,\nQ_and_not_P: 0.06,\nQ_given_P: 0.10\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.040821994520255034, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.020410997260127517, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.28837490036423613, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
