For each rule, first print the mathematical rule and the associated numbers associated with it.  Then think VERY carefully about whether the outputs obey the mathematical rule. Then output whether it obeys the rule. Your output MUST look and be formatted as follows.\n    neg: P = 1- not_P, EQUATION is EVALUATION, \n    andor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, EQUATION is EVALUATION, \n    and:  max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), EQUATION is EVALUATION,\n    ...\n    {ALL consistency checks passed!} OR {failed_check_1, failed_check_2 ... consistency checks failed!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "neg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.73 = 1 - 0.35 is FALSE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.73 = 0.71 + 0.23 - 0.33 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.73 + 0.33 - 1, 0) <= 0.23 <= min(0.73, 0.33) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.73, 0.33) <= 0.71 <= min(1, 0.73 + 0.33) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.73 = 0.71 - 0.12 is FALSE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.73 \u2248 0.23 / 0.32 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.73 = 0.76 is FALSE\n\nneg, andor, or, but, para consistency checks failed!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "PROB: Now again output your probability estimates of each variable in a dict like format like before, but taking account and correcting any consistency violations that occurred before.\n        Note that changing the probability of one given variable for one consistency check will also affect consistency rules for others.
