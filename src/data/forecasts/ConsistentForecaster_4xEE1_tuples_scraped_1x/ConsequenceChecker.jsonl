Unlike many of the markets and questions on Manifold, these polls will simply ask \"has weak AGI been achieved,\" rather than providing a definition of the term. The goal is that given that the term is so broad, the only way to characterize AI progress is also to allow respondents to vote based upon their own understanding.\n\nProgress has been steady. The previous polls are referenced here:\n\n@/SteveSokolowski/did-openai-achieve-weak-agi-with-gp (Answer: 15)\n\n@/SteveSokolowski/june-2024-has-weak-agi-been-achieve (Answer: 27)\n\nThe previous markets on this topic, which significantly underestimated Manifold's belief in AI progress, were:\n\n@/SteveSokolowski/what-percentage-of-manifold-poll-re\n\n@/SteveSokolowski/will-at-least-20-of-manifold-respon\n\nThe polls will not reference any specific model, and will not define \"AGI\" except to state that the poll does not require that the software system be able to manipulate the physical world. The polls open on the 23rd of each month and close on the 30th.\n\nThis market will resolve to YES if the August 2024 poll results in a ratio of YES/(NO + YES) greater than or equal to 0.3. The \"no opinion\" respondents will be ignored. Otherwise, this question will resolve to NO.\n\nSee also:\n\n@/SteveSokolowski/will-one-of-the-monthly-has-weak-ag", "resolution_date": "2024-08-31T10:45:57", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "created_date": "2024-07-02T11:42:56Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.5973840800541675, "metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.65, "elicitation_metadata": null}, {"name": "ExpectedEvidenceChecker", "data": {"Q": {"id": "c442e170-65ef-409f-9647-55d47a31c24b", "title": "Will at least 40% of Manifold respondents agree that weak AGI had been achieved before August 23, 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as Yes if the August 2024 poll results in a ratio of YES/(NO + YES) greater than or equal to 0.4.
