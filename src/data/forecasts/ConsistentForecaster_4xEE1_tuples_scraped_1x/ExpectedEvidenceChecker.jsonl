If fewer than 10 Senators express such support by that time, this question resolves NO. \n\nSuppose the following is true: The Democratic Party does not require more than one round of voting in its roll call ballot to formally nominate its candidate for the 2024 US presidential election. Then, will at least 20 House or Senate Democrats sign a public letter opposing the plan to virtually nominate Biden early?\n\nContext from Politico:\n\nDozens of House Democrats are organizing a plan to speak out against their own party\u2019s effort to seal President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination sooner than originally planned, which they argue stifles the intense ongoing debate about his candidacy, according to a lawmaker involved in the effort.\n\nA drafted letter, circulated by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO, offers the first public signal from Democrats since the weekend\u2019s attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump that scores of their own members remain deeply unsettled about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really bad move by the DNC. Somebody thinks it\u2019s a clever way to lock down debate and I guess by dint of sheer force, achieve unity, but it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman said in an interview. He declined to confirm the existence of a letter.\n\nResolution criteria: This resolves YES if a public letter opposing the early nomination plan is signed by at least 20 House Members or Senators who caucus with the Democratic Party before market close at the end of Sunday, July 21st. Multiple such letters with a combined total of 20 lawmaker's signatures would also be sufficient to resolve this market to YES.

One of the polls asks Manifold respondents to vote with Joe Biden on a hypothetical ballot, and another asks respondents to vote with a generic Democrat on the hypothetical ballot.\n\nPublic opinion polls consistently show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, but every other Democrat hypothetically surveyed polls ahead or within the margin of error. Are Manifold respondents representative of the general public? \n\nThis market will resolve YES if the percentage of votes for Donald Trump in poll 1 is less than that in poll 2 by 3% or more when both polls close. \n\nThe formula for determining the percentage of votes for Trump is (Trump / (Trump + (the Democrat in the question) + Someone else)). The answer is YES if this formula for poll 1 - the formula for poll 2 < 0.03. Otherwise, it is NO. \n\nThe polls and this question will never resolve N/A, and will remain open until the close time no matter what. \n\nIf it is true that Donald Trump Jr. does not announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination by July 15, 2024, and the percentage of votes for Donald Trump in the poll with Joe Biden is less than that in the poll with a generic Democrat by 3% or more, then will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?", "resolution_date": "2024-07-15 22:20:00+00:00", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2020-05-09 10:00:00+00:00", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.65, "elicitation_metadata": null}}}]}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.1026217550457844, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}
