All five individuals must be part of the same group message. Reports of any number of unnamed democrats writing to Biden and asking him to step aside will not satisfy this criterion unless at least 5 qualifying names are later made public before this date. If these criteria are not met before July 20th, this condition is not satisfied. (b) Joe Biden must still be officially president of the United States at 11:59 pm on July 31st 2024. (c) There are two Manifold polls posted, which both close on July 6. One of the polls asks Manifold respondents to vote with Joe Biden on a hypothetical ballot, and another asks respondents to vote with a generic Democrat on the hypothetical ballot. Public opinion polls consistently show Joe Biden losing to Donald Trump outside the margin of error, but every other Democrat hypothetically surveyed polls ahead or within the margin of error. This market will resolve YES if the percentage of votes for Donald Trump in poll 1 exceeds that in poll 2 by 3% or more when both polls close. The formula for determining the percentage of votes for Trump is (Trump / (Trump + (the Democrat in the question) + Someone else)). The answer is YES if this formula for poll 1 - the formula for poll 2 >= 0.03.

Somebody thinks it\u2019s a clever way to lock down debate and I guess by dint of sheer force, achieve unity, but it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman said in an interview.
