The film, directed by Shawn Levy and starring Ryan Reynolds, is projected to earn between $340 million and $360 million globally in its opening weekend. This would mark the biggest opening weekend ever for an R-rated movie. Domestically, the film is expected to debut with $160 million to $170 million, making it the biggest R-rated opening of all-time. \n\nThe record for biggest opening weekend for an R-rated movie is the original Deadpool at $284.5M ($152.2M domestic).\n\nWill the new movie top these marks? It will probably be close... It will certainly play at more theaters... Deadpool was a smash hit at the time, and a bit surprising. \n\nTo clarify on resolution...\n-> this market will resolve YES if Deadpool x Wolverine grosses less than or equal to $284.5M globally this opening weekend according to reports\n-> OR the Hollywood Reporter (or equivalent publication) does not report it as the record for an R-rated movie release. \n\nIn other words the BoxOfficeMojo numbers should be seen as unofficial until there's confirmation in the Hollywood press. And the number we shoot for is \u2264$284.5M internationally... this weekend.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-29 18:06:39+00:00", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-23 17:28:16+00:00", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.3, "elicitation_metadata": null}}}]}}}
