The question hinges on two factors: the political landscape indicated by Trump's lead over Biden and the public perception of weak AGI.\n\n1. **Political Context**: On July 15, 2024, Trump's lead over Biden being between 3 and 4 points suggests a competitive political climate. This could influence public sentiment and opinions on various topics, including technological advancements like AGI. However, the direct correlation between political sentiment and opinions on AGI is not strong.\n\n2. **Public Perception of AGI**: The term \"weak AGI\" refers to AI systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence but do not possess general intelligence or consciousness. The public's understanding of AGI varies widely, and many people may have differing opinions on whether weak AGI has been achieved. Given the rapid advancements in AI technology, it is plausible that a significant portion of the population, especially those engaged in technology and science, might believe that weak AGI has indeed been achieved.\n\n3. **Poll Dynamics**: The poll's requirement for at least 30% agreement suggests that even a modest level of belief in weak AGI could lead to a positive resolution. Considering the growing discourse around AI and its capabilities, it is reasonable to expect that a minimum of 30% of respondents might affirm that weak AGI has been achieved, especially since the term is not rigorously defined in the poll.\n\n4. **Historical Trends**: In previous polls regarding technological advancements, there has often been a significant portion of respondents who express optimism or belief in the progress of AI, indicating that 30% is a plausible threshold.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are uncertainties surrounding both the political context and public understanding of AGI, the combination of increasing public engagement with AI topics and the relatively low threshold for the poll leads to the conclusion that it is likely that at least 30% of respondents will agree that weak AGI had been achieved before July 23, 2024."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "22e23ff0-f77b-447c-8fca-cc331474c93f", "title": "Conditional on both Trump's lead over Biden being between 3 and 4 points and at least 30% agreeing weak AGI is achieved, will Biden announce dropping out and resigning before August 2024?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: (1) Trump's lead over Biden is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4 points on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average.

If this lead is maintained, it could signify a strengthening position for Trump and a potentially weakening position for Biden. However, political dynamics can change rapidly, and incumbents often have advantages that can mitigate polling deficits.\n\n2. **Public Perception of AGI**: The condition that at least 30% of respondents agree that weak AGI has been achieved is crucial. If this threshold is met, it may indicate a significant shift in public perception regarding technology, which could impact Biden's administration and its policies. The implications of AGI on job markets, privacy, and other societal factors could lead to increased pressure on Biden to address these concerns.\n\n3. **Biden's Political Strategy**: Historically, incumbents do not typically drop out of races unless facing extreme circumstances. While a 3-4 point deficit is noteworthy, it is still within a range where incumbents might choose to fight rather than resign. Additionally, the announcement of a resignation before the election could be interpreted as an admission of failure, which is a significant political risk.\n\n4. **Timing of the Announcement**: The announcement must occur before the end of July 2024.

Given the current trends in technology and public discourse, it seems plausible that at least 30% of respondents might agree that weak AGI has been achieved by July 2024.

While Biden's approval ratings and political pressures could lead to speculation about dropping out, an actual announcement of both dropping out and resigning is a significant political event and would require a very specific set of circumstances, including potential pressure from within his party and the electorate.

Historically, political pressure from party members, especially from within the same party, can create significant challenges for a sitting president. However, even if there is substantial pressure for Biden to exit the race, it does not automatically lead to his resignation or removal from office. The president's position is secured by the constitutional framework, and unless there are compelling reasons (such as health issues or a scandal), it is unlikely that he would step down simply due to political pressure. Moreover, the resolution of this question hinges on the assumption that Biden will still be in office despite the pressure. The fact that there is a significant amount of time (over a year) until the resolution date suggests that political dynamics can shift, and Biden may still maintain his presidency even if he faces challenges from within his party.

Given the current oppressive environment towards opposition leaders in Venezuela, there is a non-negligible chance that she could be imprisoned before the deadline. However, predicting specific actions of a government can be tricky, and this situation is fluid.\n\n2. **Coverage of Biden's Potential Dropout**: The second part of the question depends on whether Joe Biden will drop out of the race and if a reliable media outlet will cover this at least 6 hours in advance. There has been some speculation about Biden's candidacy, but as of now, he has not indicated any intention to drop out. If he does drop out, it is likely that major news outlets would cover such a significant political event, given their usual practices of reporting on presidential candidates.\n\n3. **Democratic Opposition Letter**: The context provided indicates that there is already a movement among House Democrats to oppose the early nomination of Biden. Given that there is an organized effort and a draft letter already circulating, it seems plausible that they could gather the required signatures before the deadline. The political pressure and dissent within the party suggest that at least 20 members could sign such a letter.\n\nIn summary, while there are uncertainties surrounding Machado's imprisonment and Biden's potential dropout, the organized opposition among Democrats and the likelihood of major media coverage suggest a reasonable chance that all conditions could be met by the deadlines mentioned.

If Biden resigns, it could lead to uncertainty in U.S. support for Israel, possibly prompting Iran to act more aggressively.\n\n3. **Iran's Military Posture**: Iran has a history of engaging in military actions when it perceives an opportunity, particularly when it believes its adversaries are weakened or distracted. Given the timeline, if both conditions are met, the likelihood of Iran initiating military action increases, especially if they perceive a lack of U.S. resolve or support for Israel.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider that military actions are complex and influenced by numerous factors, including internal Iranian politics, regional dynamics, and responses from Israel and the U.S. Thus, while the conditions set forth could create a scenario conducive to military action, the actual initiation of such action remains uncertain."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "d537c58a-5837-444b-a226-4b5cda6925fe", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) OpenAI commits to \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" before July 1, 2024, (b) Joe Biden announces resignation and withdrawal before end of July 2024, and (c) Iran initiates military action on Israeli territory before August 13, 2024?", "body": "(a) OpenAI publicly commits to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle before July 1, 2024.

OpenAI has been responsive to public concerns in the past, and there is a significant incentive for them to make such a commitment to maintain trust and credibility.\n\n(b) The likelihood of Joe Biden announcing his resignation and withdrawal before the end of July 2024 is considerably lower.

The political landscape is unpredictable, but a resignation announcement seems improbable.\n\n(c) The initiation of military action by Iran on Israeli territory is a complex geopolitical issue. While tensions between Iran and Israel are historically high, predicting military actions is fraught with uncertainty.

Given Biden's age and health concerns, while this is a serious matter, it is still relatively unlikely that such an event would occur within this specific timeframe.

As of now, there have been ongoing investigations and legal proceedings related to Trump's actions in Georgia, particularly surrounding the 2020 election. The timeline is significant; given that we are already in 2023, there is a possibility that charges could be brought forth as the legal processes unfold. Additionally, the political climate and the actions of the legal team involved will also affect the likelihood of charges being filed. If there are indications or leaks suggesting that prosecutors are considering witness tampering charges, this would increase the probability. However, it is also important to consider potential delays or complications in the legal process that could prevent charges from being filed before the specified date. Legal maneuvers, appeals, and other procedural elements can slow down the timeline significantly. Taking all these factors into account, while there is a reasonable chance that witness tampering charges could be brought before June 1, 2024, there are also uncertainties that make it difficult to assign a very high probability."}}}, "Q_given_P": {"question": {"id": "f7334e40-2c66-4e15-a3bb-7eab94d7cf7c", "title": "If Donald Trump is charged with witness tampering in Georgia before June 1, 2024, will 10 or more Democratic Senators call for Biden to drop out before July 20?", "body": "The question resolves **Yes** if Donald Trump is charged or indicted for any statements related to potential witnesses in *[The State of Georgia v.

The relationship between the belief in AGI and the occurrence of an attack on the Crimean Bridge is not direct. However, if we assume that a belief in advanced AI capabilities could correlate with increased geopolitical tensions or escalations in conflict, there might be a higher likelihood of aggressive actions, including attacks, in such a context. While the specific dynamics of the Crimean situation are complex and influenced by many factors (political, military, and social), the mere increase in belief in AGI does not necessarily lead to an attack. However, if we are to consider the hypothetical scenario where respondents believe that weak AGI has been achieved, this might correlate with a sense of urgency or a shift in strategy among actors involved in the Crimean conflict. Nevertheless, without concrete evidence linking the belief in AGI to a specific attack on the Crimean Bridge, it\u2019s difficult to assign a high probability to the occurrence of such an attack before July 1, 2024. The probability of an attack occurring is influenced by numerous unpredictable factors, including military strategies, political decisions, and external events. Given these considerations, I would estimate a moderate probability that the Crimean Bridge will be attacked before July 1, 2024, under the condition that 30% of respondents believe weak AGI has been achieved."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "727d9f8d-87bb-4860-a161-86c531ef3fe9", "title": "Given that at least 30% of Manifold respondents agree that weak AGI was achieved before July 23, 2024, and the Crimean Bridge is attacked before July 1, 2024, will Trump's lead over Biden be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: (a) At least 30% of Manifold respondents agree that weak AGI had been achieved before July 23, 2024, based on the monthly poll results, and (b) The Crimean Bridge is hit with an attack before July 1, 2024, as reported by credible sources.\n\nThen, is it true that Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden will be greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, according to 538's national polling average?\n\nResolution criteria for condition:\n- For (a), the market resolves to YES if the July 2024 poll results in a ratio of YES/(NO + YES) greater than or equal to 0.3.\n- For (b), the market resolves to YES if, after May 2, 2024, and before July 1, 2024, credible sources report that the Crimean Bridge has been struck with weapons fire, explosives, or projectiles that could pose a credible threat to the integrity of the bridge.\n\nResolution criteria for the outcome:\n- The question resolves as YES if Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden in 538's national polling average for the 2024 presidential election is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, as reported on the chart for that date when accessed by Metaculus on July 17, 2024.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-31T10:45:57Z", "question_type": "conditional_binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-05-03T14:30:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": null}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.65, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "To assess the probability of Trump's lead over Biden being greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 on July 15, 2024, we must consider several factors: 1. **Poll Results and AGI Agreement**: The condition states that at least 30% of respondents agree that weak AGI was achieved before July 23, 2024. This perception could influence voter sentiment and confidence, potentially benefiting Trump if voters perceive technological advancements as favoring his policies or leadership style. 2. **Impact of the Crimean Bridge Attack**: The attack on the Crimean Bridge before July 1, 2024, would be a significant geopolitical event. Such incidents often influence public opinion and can sway voters' perceptions of national security, which is traditionally a strong suit for Republican candidates like Trump. If the attack is perceived as a failure of the current administration to manage foreign threats, it could bolster Trump's support. 3. **Polling Dynamics**: Historically, polling averages can fluctuate based on recent events, economic conditions, and public sentiment. Given the volatility of political landscapes, a lead of greater than 2 and less than or equal to 4 is plausible, especially if the two aforementioned conditions (AGI agreement and the Crimean Bridge attack) create a favorable environment for Trump. 4. **Timing**: The resolution date is set for July 15, 2024, which gives time for the political landscape to evolve.

The historical data shows a steady increase in the percentage of respondents who believe weak AGI has been achieved, with the last reported figure being 27%.

Given the political climate and the historical polling trends leading up to the election, it's plausible that Trump's lead could be within the specified range on the given date.

(a) The first part requires at least five named Democratic House Members or Senators to collectively pressure Biden to drop out of the race before July 20, 2024. Given the current political climate and Biden's standing within the party, it is plausible that a faction of Democrats may feel compelled to express concerns about his candidacy, especially if polling shows him struggling. However, the requirement for a coordinated effort among five named individuals makes this scenario less likely, as it requires a significant degree of unity and public dissent which can be politically risky. (b) The second part requires ten or more Democratic Senators to call for Biden to drop out. This is a high bar, as it would necessitate a substantial portion of the Senate Democratic caucus to openly oppose the sitting president. Such a move would likely only happen if there is considerable pressure on Biden, possibly from poor polling or a strong challenger emerging. Given the loyalty often displayed within party ranks, this scenario also seems unlikely. (c) The third part involves Israel conducting a deadly attack within Iran before May 1, 2024, resulting in at least five deaths. While tensions between Israel and Iran have been high, and there have been military actions in the region, predicting a specific attack with a specific outcome is highly uncertain. However, given the historical context of Israeli military actions in Iran and ongoing geopolitical tensions, this part is more plausible than the first two. Considering the interplay of these three components, the overall probability that all conditions will be met is quite low.

Geopolitical stability or instability can influence global markets, including commodities, which in turn can affect inflation rates in the US. A prolonged conflict may lead to increased energy prices, supply chain disruptions, and other inflationary pressures. 2. **Economic Indicators**: The US Core CPI is influenced by a variety of factors, including consumer demand, supply chain issues, and monetary policy. If the geopolitical situation leads to increased costs for goods and services, we might expect to see a rise in the Core CPI. However, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions in response to inflation also play a critical role. If the Fed is actively combating inflation, they might raise interest rates, which could slow down economic activity and potentially keep the Core CPI increase below 0.1%. 3. **Historical Trends**: Looking at historical CPI data, month-over-month increases can fluctuate significantly based on seasonal trends and external shocks. A 0.1% increase is relatively modest, and given the potential for economic pressures from the geopolitical situation, it is plausible that the Core CPI could exceed this threshold.

Several factors could influence the situation by June 1, 2024: 1. Military Dynamics: The effectiveness of Ukrainian counteroffensives and the resilience of Russian forces will play a critical role. If Ukraine manages to regain control over territories, the likelihood of Russia maintaining control over Chasiv Yar diminishes. 2. International Support: The level of military and financial support from Western countries to Ukraine may impact the conflict's trajectory. Increased support could bolster Ukrainian capabilities. 3. Strategic Importance: Chasiv Yar's significance in the broader context of the war may also affect control. If it is deemed strategically important, both sides may prioritize its control. 4. Current Trends: As of late 2023, there were indications that Ukraine was making gains in certain areas. If this trend continues, it could suggest a reduced likelihood of Russian control in the future.

If this trend continues, it is conceivable that Nvidia could surpass Apple\u2019s market cap, particularly given the volatility and rapid changes in tech stock valuations. However, Apple has a strong market presence and brand loyalty, making it a formidable competitor. The probability of Nvidia surpassing Apple is moderate but not guaranteed.\n\n3. **CBOE S&P 500 Volatility Index**: The VXVCLS, which measures market volatility, is influenced by various economic factors including interest rates, inflation, and overall market sentiment. Given the current economic environment and potential uncertainties leading up to the 2024 elections, it is likely that volatility could increase year-over-year. Therefore, I would estimate a relatively high probability that the index will be higher on July 20, 2024, compared to July 20, 2023.\n\nCombining these factors, the overall probability of all three events occurring is lower than the individual probabilities, primarily due to the uncertainty surrounding the political dynamics and Nvidia's market position relative to Apple. \n\nTaking all of this into account, I would estimate the probability of all three conditions being met as follows:"}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.05728419217151448, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.01432104804287862, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.4026034227908942, "check": false, "check_result": "Failed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

However, the timing of such an announcement is uncertain, and Biden has not indicated any desire to step down.\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the invocation of the 25th Amendment and Biden's political intentions, I would estimate a moderate probability that he will announce he will not accept the nomination before July 15, 2024, provided the first condition is met."}}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"question": {"id": "d1f11ab7-23ef-4eb1-b9f6-d25cedb3cb02", "title": "Will Russian athletes be barred from the 2024 Olympics, Biden be declared incapacitated under the 25th Amendment before August, and Biden announce before July 15, 2024 that he will not accept the Democratic nomination for President?", "body": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if ALL of the following occur:\n\n(a) Russian athletes are barred from competing at the 2024 Olympics under either (i) the Russian flag, (ii) The Russian Olympic Committee's flag, or (iii) any other independent or neutral flag.

The duration of the incapacity does not matter for this question. Biden exiting the office of the Presidency by death, resignation, etc does not count.

Various sports organizations and governing bodies have already imposed sanctions on Russian athletes, and this trend may continue into the 2024 Olympics. However, there is a possibility that some athletes could compete under a neutral flag or through specific exemptions, which could lead to more than 34 Russian athletes participating. Therefore, while it is plausible that Russian athletes will be barred, the exact number that may compete remains uncertain.\n\n(b) The invocation of the 25th Amendment is a highly political and sensitive issue. The current political climate and Biden's standing as president suggest that such an action would be unprecedented and unlikely to occur. The Vice President and the Cabinet would need to agree on Biden's incapacity, which is a significant political hurdle.\n\n(c) Biden's decision regarding the 2024 nomination is also uncertain.

If we assess the likelihood of each country qualifying based on past performances and current trends, we might estimate that Croatia and Belgium have roughly a 50% chance each of qualifying, while Estonia might have a higher chance, perhaps around 70%. To find the combined probability of all three qualifying, we can multiply the individual probabilities (assuming independence for simplicity). Thus, we have: - Probability of Croatia qualifying: 0.5 - Probability of Belgium qualifying: 0.5 - Probability of Estonia qualifying: 0.7 Calculating the combined probability: P(all qualify) = P(Croatia) * P(Belgium) * P(Estonia) = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.7 = 0.175 This suggests a 17.5% chance that all three countries will qualify for the Grand Final.

Additionally, the Core CPI is a lagging indicator, meaning it often reflects past economic conditions rather than immediate political events. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy, which adjusts interest rates based on inflation data, will also play a critical role in influencing the CPI. If inflation continues to be managed effectively, it is plausible that the Core CPI could either stabilize or increase marginally.

The period leading up to July 2024 is likely to be impacted by the broader economic conditions, including Federal Reserve policies and global economic factors. 2. Joe Biden's Interview Impact: The requirement for Joe Biden to have an in-person interview could suggest a focus on economic issues, which might influence public perception and consumer confidence. However, the direct impact of such an interview on inflation metrics like the Core CPI is unclear. It may have a psychological effect but is less likely to have a tangible impact on the CPI itself. 3. BSE SENSEX Closing Value: The condition regarding the BSE SENSEX closing value being between 75,000 and 76,000 indicates strong performance in the Indian stock market. While this may reflect positive economic sentiment in India, the correlation with US Core CPI is indirect and depends on global economic conditions. A strong stock market can sometimes reflect confidence that can spill over into other markets, but it is not a direct driver of US inflation metrics. 4. Historical Trends: Looking at historical data, the US Core CPI has shown fluctuations, but it is often influenced by seasonal patterns, commodity prices, and supply chain issues. An increase of more than 0.1% is within the realm of possibility, especially if there are inflationary pressures from other sectors. Given these considerations, while the conditions set forth may create a context for potential economic activity, there is significant uncertainty about the direct impact on the Core CPI.

Swimming has historically been a dominant sport in the Olympics, with swimmers often winning multiple medals. The potential for a swimmer to emerge as the highest gold medal winner is high, given the prominence of swimming events. As for the INA winning 21 or more gold medals, this is more uncertain. The INA's performance will depend on the athletes eligible to compete under this category, which has been a point of contention due to geopolitical factors. However, if we consider the overall medal distribution and the potential for strong INA performances, this scenario could be plausible.\n\n(b) The second part involves the participation of Russian athletes. Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions and past sanctions, there is a significant chance that Russian athletes will be barred from competing in the 2024 Olympics. The IOC has previously taken strong stances against Russia due to doping scandals, and there is a possibility that they will continue this trend, especially if international relations do not improve. The threshold of 34 Russian athletes is also quite low, making it likely that this condition can be met.\n\nOverall, while both events have uncertainties, the likelihood of a swimmer winning the most gold medals seems high, and the barring of Russian athletes is also a strong possibility based on current trends.

Historically, incumbents like Joe Biden have advantages, but Trump has a strong base and may benefit from running against a known opponent rather than a generic one. The dynamics of polling can also change based on various factors such as economic conditions, key events, and voter sentiment. If Trump is perceived as a more favorable option against Biden rather than a generic Democrat, it's plausible that he could gain an additional 3% support. However, Biden's incumbency, name recognition, and established voter base could counteract this potential gain. Moreover, the specific demographics of the Manifold respondents could also influence the outcome.

Night Shyamalan's film \"Trap\" achieving a Rotten Tomatoes score of at least 60%. While this condition is somewhat arbitrary and doesn't directly affect the basketball outcome, it does create a scenario where we are only considering the 76ers' chances if the film scores well. Given Shyamalan's mixed track record, predicting the film's success is difficult, but a score of 60% is not unreasonable for a mainstream release.\n\nIf we assume the film meets the score condition, we can then focus on the 76ers' chances. Given the competitive nature of the NBA and the unpredictability of playoff outcomes, I would estimate that the 76ers have a moderate chance of winning the Finals, but it is not guaranteed. Considering these factors, I would estimate a probability of around 0.3, reflecting a reasonable chance of the 76ers winning under the given condition."}}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"question": {"id": "3dc52135-ceed-42f6-b671-a7cbec796a00", "title": "Given both M.

As of now, Nvidia has been experiencing significant growth due to its leadership in the AI and gaming sectors, while Apple continues to be a dominant player in consumer electronics but has faced challenges in growth rates. Analysts predict that Nvidia's growth trajectory may continue to outpace Apple's, especially in the context of the increasing demand for AI technologies and GPUs. Additionally, if Nvidia successfully launches new products or secures major contracts, this could further enhance its market position. Conversely, Apple has a solid ecosystem and brand loyalty, which could stabilize its market cap. Given these considerations, while Nvidia has a strong growth potential, Apple's established market presence and brand loyalty cannot be discounted. However, if current trends continue, there is a reasonable chance that Nvidia could surpass Apple in market cap by mid-2024.

While it is reasonable to expect that Kalenjin athletes will be competitive, there are many variables (other athletes, conditions on race day, etc.) that could affect the outcome. Therefore, while there is a good chance that at least one Kalenjin athlete could win, predicting both men's and women's marathons is more uncertain.\n\n2. **BSE SENSEX Closing Between 76k and 77k**: The BSE SENSEX is influenced by numerous economic factors including market conditions, investor sentiment, and global economic trends. Predicting a specific closing range for a stock index several months in advance is inherently uncertain. While the index could potentially reach this range, it is difficult to estimate the probability without more context on market trends leading up to that date.\n\n3. **Denmark Qualifying for Eurovision Grand Final**: Denmark has a mixed history in Eurovision, often qualifying but not always making it to the final.

However, the political situation in France is more complex. The current Prime Minister of France, as of October 2023, belongs to a coalition that may change by mid-2024 due to various political dynamics, including public opinion, elections, and potential shifts in party alliances. The New Popular Front and Together are significant political coalitions in France, and if the Prime Minister were to belong to a different coalition, it would likely indicate a considerable shift in the political landscape, possibly due to an election or a significant political event. Given that political coalitions can change and that there are often unexpected developments in politics, there is a reasonable chance that by July 30, 2024, the Prime Minister could belong to a coalition other than the current ones.

This could influence the expectations of critics and audiences alike. 2. **Market Trends**: The timing of the film's release in August 2024 is significant. Typically, summer releases can be hit or miss, but films released later in the summer can benefit from less competition and a more relaxed audience. If the summer box office is strong, it may help \"Trap\" gain traction. 3. **Public Health Context**: The conditions regarding hospitalizations and Biden's political situation may impact the cultural context in which the film is released. If public interest is high due to health concerns or political dynamics, it could lead to increased scrutiny or support for the film. 4. **Pre-release Buzz**: The film's marketing and pre-release reviews will play a crucial role in shaping critics' opinions. If early screenings generate positive word-of-mouth, it could lead to a higher score. 5. **Competition**: The films being released around the same time will also affect \"Trap's\" performance.
