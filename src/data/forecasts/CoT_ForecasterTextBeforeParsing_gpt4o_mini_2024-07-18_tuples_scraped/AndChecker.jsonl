Historically, public figures often hesitate to openly challenge a sitting president from their own party, especially one who has been a significant figure in the party. 2. **Biden's Decision**: As for Biden announcing he will not accept the nomination, this is a significant decision that would likely be influenced by various factors including his health, approval ratings, and the overall political landscape closer to the election date. Given that Biden has expressed intentions to run, it would require a major shift in circumstances for him to publicly announce that he will not seek the nomination. 3. **Timing**: The deadlines set for both conditions are quite close to the election date, which adds urgency but also increases the likelihood of political maneuvering and uncertainty. The closer we get to the election, the more pressure there will be on Biden, but also the more entrenched he may become in his campaign. 4. **Historical Context**: Historically, it is rare for sitting presidents to be pressured out of their re-election campaigns, especially from within their party. The dynamics of the Democratic Party also play a role\u2014if there is significant internal support for Biden, it would be unlikely for five members to come together to pressure him. Considering these factors, while there is a non-negligible chance that both conditions could occur, the overall likelihood remains low.

Operational Feasibility: Israel has demonstrated its capability to carry out complex military operations beyond its borders, especially against high-value targets in Iran. The potential for an operation that could result in significant casualties exists, particularly if Israel perceives an imminent threat. 4. Casualty Threshold: The requirement for at least five deaths makes the scenario more plausible, as military operations can often have unintended consequences that lead to civilian or military casualties exceeding this threshold. 5. Timeframe: Given that the question is time-sensitive with a deadline of May 1, 2024, the urgency may push Israel to act if it sees an opportunity or necessity to do so. Considering these factors, while there is a significant risk of an attack occurring, the exact probability is difficult to quantify due to the unpredictability of military actions and geopolitical developments. However, given the current landscape, I estimate a moderate to high probability that Israel could carry out such an attack."}}}, "Q": {"question": {"id": "ef270100-cb81-4429-bbff-6500ae998a1a", "title": "Will Iran's Guardian Council include Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's name on its list of approved candidates for president of Iran?", "body": "This question resolves **Yes** if Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is included in Iran's Guardian Council's list of qualified presidential candidates for the upcoming presidential election.", "resolution_date": "2024-06-11T06:59:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-04-13T22:04:00Z", "url": null, "metadata": {}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"prob": 0.25, "metadata": {"chain_of_thought": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a former president of Iran, has had a controversial political career.

The likelihood of such an attack occurring within Iran's borders is influenced by ongoing geopolitical tensions, especially regarding Iran's nuclear program and its support for groups hostile to Israel. Given the current state of affairs and Israel's strategic interests, it is plausible that an attack could happen before May 1, 2024, especially if tensions escalate. 2. **Ahmadinejad's Candidacy**: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, former president of Iran, has expressed interest in running for the presidency again. However, the Guardian Council, which has the authority to approve candidates, is known for its strict vetting process, often excluding candidates who do not align with the regime's interests. While Ahmadinejad has a significant base of support, there are also factions within the Iranian political system that may oppose his candidacy. The decision will depend on the political climate closer to the election.

Given the popularity of the 'Deadpool' franchise and the addition of Wolverine, which is a highly recognizable character, there is a strong likelihood that this film will perform well at the box office. The previous 'Deadpool' film grossed over $132 million in its opening weekend alone, and with the combined star power and anticipation for this sequel, it is reasonable to estimate that the opening will exceed the combined total of 'Deadpool' and 'The Wolverine.' Therefore, I estimate the probability of (a) resolving YES to be high, around 0.75. For (b), we look at M. Night Shyamalan's recent films and their CinemaScores. The trend shows a decline in scores over the years, with 'Old' and 'Knock at the Cabin' receiving lower scores. However, 'Split' and 'Glass' performed better, with 'Split' receiving a B+. Given that 'Trap' has a great trailer and Shyamalan's reputation, there is a possibility that it could receive at least a B. However, the recent trend suggests a cautious approach.

Even if legal grounds exist, political pushback may prevent states from taking action to remove him.\n\n3. **State-by-State Variability**: Each state has its own legal framework and political dynamics.

However, the exact outcome will depend on the negotiations leading up to the WHA and the positions of key countries, which can be unpredictable.\n\n2. OpenAI's commitment to the \"no retaliation for public risk disclosure\" principle is also uncertain. The company has been in the spotlight regarding ethical considerations and transparency in AI development. While there is increasing pressure for organizations to adopt such principles, the specific commitment needed to satisfy the conditions outlined in the question adds another layer of complexity. It requires not only a public statement but also a perception of a genuine shift in policy, which may be influenced by internal company decisions and external pressures from advocacy groups.\n\nBoth events are plausible but carry inherent uncertainties. The approval of the Pandemic Agreement seems moderately likely given the current global health focus, while OpenAI's commitment is more uncertain, depending on their internal policies and external pressures. Overall, I would estimate a moderate probability for both events occurring, leaning more towards a \"Yes\" resolution, but with caution due to the unpredictability of both political and corporate decision-making processes."}}}}, "violation_data": {"default": {"metric": "default", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "default_scaled": {"metric": "default_scaled", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}, "frequentist": {"metric": "frequentist", "violation": 0.0, "check": true, "check_result": "Passed", "successful_elicitation": true}}}

For part (b), the polling dynamics can be influenced by various factors, including the political landscape as the election date approaches. If Trump Jr. were to be the nominee, he would face the challenge of solidifying his base and appealing to undecided voters.

Current Polling Trends: As of now, polling data shows fluctuating leads between Trump and Biden, with Trump often leading by small margins. If we analyze the trends leading up to mid-2024, we can see that incumbents typically have advantages, but Biden's approval ratings and various external factors (like economic conditions, key events, etc.) will heavily influence voter sentiment. 2. Historical Context: Historical polling data indicates that leads in elections can change rapidly due to events, debates, or scandals. A lead of 2-3 points is relatively narrow and could easily be affected by late campaign developments. 3. FiveThirtyEight's Methodology: FiveThirtyEight uses a data-driven approach that averages multiple polls and considers the reliability of polling sources. Their averages tend to smooth out extreme fluctuations, which could suggest a more stable lead for Trump in this range. 4. Political Climate: As the election approaches, voter turnout and enthusiasm can significantly shift. Factors such as economic performance, public sentiment on key issues, and campaign dynamics will play a crucial role in determining the lead. Given these considerations, while there is a reasonable chance that Trump could maintain a lead within this narrow margin, the volatility of polling data and the political landscape makes it uncertain.

In the context of the Democratic Party, several factors will influence the likelihood of a brokered convention in 2024. 1. **Candidate Landscape**: The Democratic primaries will likely feature a mix of established candidates and newcomers. If there are multiple strong contenders who can attract significant delegate support, the risk of a brokered convention increases. 2. **Delegate Allocation**: The Democratic National Committee has rules for delegate allocation that generally favor proportional distribution. This means that unless one candidate dominates the primaries, it is plausible that no candidate will achieve a majority of delegates before the convention. 3. **Historical Context**: Brokered conventions are rare in modern politics, with the last significant one occurring in 1952 for the Democrats. However, the political landscape can change rapidly, and factors such as party unity, voter sentiment, and external events can influence the dynamics leading to the convention. 4. **Current Political Climate**: As of now, there is considerable speculation about potential candidates and their viability. If the leading candidates are closely matched in delegate accumulation, it increases the chances of a brokered convention.

The SENSEX has experienced significant growth, especially post-pandemic, driven by economic recovery and strong corporate earnings. As of my last knowledge update in October 2023, the SENSEX had been showing a strong upward trajectory, and it was hovering around the 60,000 mark. Given the historical growth rates, it is plausible that the index could reach or exceed 75,000 by mid-2024, especially considering potential positive developments in the Indian economy, government policies, and global market conditions. However, reaching above 77,000 would require a more aggressive growth rate, which could be influenced by various factors such as inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. Given that the target range is relatively narrow and includes a ceiling at 77,000, the probability of the SENSEX closing within this range is contingent on sustained positive market conditions.

Given the regulatory environment and public pressure for accountability in AI, it is plausible that they will engage in external red-teaming and publish the results by June 30, 2024.

To assess the likelihood that the index will be higher year-over-year on July 20, 2024, we need to consider several factors. 1. Historical Trends: Volatility indices can be influenced by market conditions, economic events, and investor sentiment. Historically, volatility tends to rise during periods of economic uncertainty or market downturns. We would need to analyze the trend from July 2023 to July 2024, considering any significant economic events, changes in monetary policy, or geopolitical tensions that could impact market volatility. 2. Current Economic Indicators: As of April 2024, the economic landscape should be evaluated. If inflation, interest rates, and employment figures are stable or improving, it might suggest lower volatility. Conversely, if there are signs of economic instability or potential recessions, volatility might increase. 3. Market Sentiment: Investor sentiment can also drive volatility. If investors are generally fearful or uncertain about the market, this could lead to higher volatility. 4. Seasonal Patterns: There might be seasonal patterns in volatility that can affect the index. For instance, certain times of the year may historically see increased market activity and volatility.

However, we also need to account for the possibility of Biden gaining ground or external factors that could sway voters. The political landscape can change rapidly, and events such as debates, economic changes, or significant news events can impact polling numbers.

The Democratic Party is generally unified behind him for the upcoming election, and significant changes in leadership or candidacy typically occur closer to the election date rather than in the summer. 2.

The selection process for Eurovision typically involves national selection competitions or internal selections, and Iceland has been known to have a competitive entry. The Eurovision Song Contest has a semi-final format, where countries compete for a chance to advance to the Grand Final. The probability of qualification can depend on the quality of the song, the performance, and the public's reception during the semi-finals. Given that the question is about the qualification and not merely participation, we must also consider the competition from other countries.

Historically, Georgia has had a mixed record, with some years performing well and qualifying for the Grand Final, while in other years, they have not fared as well. The strength of their entry for 2024 will be crucial, as a strong song and performance typically increase the chances of qualification. Additionally, the competition in the Semi-finals will also play a significant role; if Georgia is up against particularly strong entries from other countries, their chances may be diminished.

First, both countries must participate in their respective Semi-finals. Historically, both Georgia and Malta have participated in Eurovision and are likely to do so again in 2024. \n\nNext, we must evaluate their chances of qualifying. Malta has had a relatively strong presence in recent Eurovision contests, often reaching the Semi-finals and occasionally qualifying for the Grand Final. Georgia, on the other hand, has had a more mixed record, with some years performing well and others not qualifying. \n\nThe probability of both countries qualifying can be seen as the product of their individual probabilities of qualifying.
