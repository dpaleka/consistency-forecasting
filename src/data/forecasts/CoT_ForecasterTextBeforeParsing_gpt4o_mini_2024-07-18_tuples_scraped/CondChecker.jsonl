However, if there is a strong sentiment within the party, especially following a major market event, it could galvanize a group of influential members to act. 4.

The Democratic Party usually rallies around its incumbent president, especially in the face of a potentially polarizing opponent like Cruz.

(a) Ted Cruz's chances of becoming the Republican nominee depend on several factors, including his popularity within the party, the dynamics of the primaries, and the potential competition from other candidates. As of now, Cruz has been a prominent figure in the Republican Party and has previously run for president. However, the nomination process can be unpredictable, especially with other potential candidates like Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis also vying for the nomination. Given the competitive nature of the Republican primaries, while Cruz has a chance, it is uncertain, and I would place this at a moderate probability. (b) Regarding Joe Biden, his announcement about not seeking re-election is also uncertain. As the incumbent president, it is typical for sitting presidents to run for re-election unless there are significant health issues or political pressures that lead them to step aside. Biden's approval ratings and the political climate will influence his decision. Currently, there has been no indication from Biden that he intends to step down, and unless something changes significantly, it is likely he will run again. Therefore, the probability of him announcing he will not accept the nomination seems low. Given that both events need to occur for the question to resolve as YES, the overall probability is a multiplication of the individual probabilities. If we estimate Cruz's probability of being the nominee at around 0.4 and Biden's probability of announcing he won't run at around 0.2, the combined probability would be 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08.

The \"Deadpool\" franchise has been successful, and expectations for sequels are typically high.

If economic conditions remain stable or improve, and if Biden can maintain a strong campaign against a less established opponent like Scott, it is plausible that FiveThirtyEight would project him as the favorite.

Second, polling data leading up to the election will be influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, Biden's approval ratings, and key events that could sway public opinion. Historically, incumbents like Biden have an advantage, but Trump's previous base and appeal could shift dynamics if Carlson's nomination energizes his supporters.

For (a) Kamala's odds of winning increasing according to Nate Silver's model: Nate Silver's model is based on polling data, which can fluctuate significantly based on various factors such as public opinion, political events, and campaign strategies. If we consider the political climate leading up to the election, especially with the ongoing dynamics in the Democratic Party and the potential influence of Biden's decision, it is plausible that Kamala Harris's odds could rise over the next week. However, the specific threshold of 46.6% is somewhat high, and it could depend on recent polling trends.

For (b) Joe Biden announcing he will not seek the nomination: Biden's decision regarding his candidacy is a significant political event that would likely be communicated clearly if it were to happen. Given the historical context and Biden's previous statements, it seems unlikely he would make such an announcement without a clear reason or context. Moreover, as the election date approaches, there may be pressure for him to either confirm or deny his candidacy. This makes it more likely that he will not announce his decision until closer to the deadline, which decreases the probability of a definitive announcement before July 15, 2024.

(a) Regarding Donald Trump's testimony at the hush money trial, there has been significant media coverage and speculation about his involvement. Given the high-profile nature of the trial and Trump's history of legal battles, it is plausible that he would testify, either in person or remotely. The likelihood of credible sources confirming his testimony is relatively high, so I would estimate a probability of around 0.7 for this event. (b) As for Iran initiating a military response against Israel before the specified deadline, the geopolitical climate is complex. While tensions between Iran and Israel are high, actual military action is less predictable. Iran may choose to engage in proxy warfare or other indirect means rather than a direct military confrontation. Given the historical context and the current diplomatic landscape, the probability of Iran initiating a significant military action on Israeli territory within the specified timeframe seems lower, so I would estimate this probability at around 0.4. To find the combined probability of both events occurring, we multiply the individual probabilities together, assuming they are independent: P(both) = P(a) * P(b) = 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.28.

Historically, sitting presidents have strong support from their party, especially as the election approaches. However, if Francis Suarez, a relatively unknown figure in national politics, were to become the Republican nominee, it could create a unique dynamic. The Democratic Party might perceive his candidacy as a weaker challenge compared to traditional Republican candidates, which could potentially galvanize support behind Biden rather than calls for his withdrawal. Moreover, the threshold of 10 Senators calling for Biden to step down is significant. It would require a notable faction within the party to publicly express discontent with Biden's candidacy, which is unlikely given the norms of party unity, particularly in the face of an election. In recent history, calls for incumbent presidents to step down are rare and typically arise from significant political crises or scandals. While there are factions within the Democratic Party that may express dissatisfaction with Biden, it is improbable that this would coalesce into a public call from 10 or more Senators, especially in the absence of a major scandal or significant electoral threat.

A call from 10 or more Democratic Senators for him to drop out would indicate a significant shift in party dynamics and could be influenced by various factors, including Biden's performance in polls, economic conditions, and potential challengers.

Given that Trump has a strong base and the potential for polarization, it is plausible that he could gain support against Biden specifically compared to a generic Democrat. However, the specific percentage gain of 3% is a significant threshold. Historical trends show that incumbents often have an advantage, but Trump's unique circumstances (such as his legal issues and public perception) could sway the results. Therefore, while there is a reasonable chance that Trump could gain ground, it is uncertain, and I would estimate this probability around 0.55.\n\n2. **Pressure from at least 5 Democratic House Members or Senators**: This scenario requires a coordinated effort from at least five prominent Democrats to urge Biden to step down. Given the current political landscape, where Biden's approval ratings have been mixed, and the presence of various factions within the Democratic Party, it is conceivable that some members may feel compelled to act. However, the threshold of five members acting as a unified group is significant, and historically, party members tend to be cautious about publicly challenging an incumbent president. Therefore, while there may be some individuals who privately believe Biden should step aside, the likelihood of five members collectively taking action is lower. I would estimate this probability around 0.30.\n\nCombining these probabilities requires estimating the joint occurrence of both events. Since these events are not entirely independent (the political climate may influence both), a conservative estimate would involve a multiplication of the two probabilities, adjusting for potential overlap. Thus, the joint probability can be estimated as:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.55 * 0.30 = 0.165\n\nHowever, considering the synergy and potential for increased pressure if Trump gains support, I would adjust this slightly upwards to account for the likelihood that if one occurs, the other might be more likely to follow.

As for the second part of the question regarding a brokered convention, while it is more difficult to predict, the current political climate, coupled with the potential divisions within the party, could lead to a scenario where multiple rounds of voting are necessary. The possibility of a brokered convention hinges on the level of unity within the Democratic Party as the election approaches, which appears uncertain given the current dynamics.
