Both bills aim to restrict abortion in South Carolina but do not represent a total ban without exceptions.\n    - **Bill 474** focuses on banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, with exceptions for medical emergencies, rape, incest, or fatal fetal anomalies.\n    - **Bill 240** proposes a ban on abortions but includes exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to the mother's life.\n\n    2. **Recent Developments**:\n    - A near-total abortion ban was defeated in South Carolina with the help of three Republican women senators, indicating that a total ban may not have sufficient support to pass.\n    - The South Carolina legislature approved a 6-week abortion ban, which includes exceptions for rape and incest, on May 24, 2023, and it was signed into law by Governor Henry McMaster on May 25, 2023.\n\n    3. **Conclusion**:\n    - Given the recent legislative actions and the defeat of a near-total abortion ban, it is unlikely that the South Carolina Senate will pass a total abortion ban by July 31, 2024.\n    - The approved 6-week abortion ban with exceptions does not meet the criteria for a 'total abortion ban' as defined in the question.\n\n    Since the question specifically asks about a total abortion ban and no such legislation has been passed as of the current date (September 21, 2024), and given the recent legislative trends, we can confidently resolve this question.", "can_resolve_question": true, "answer": false, "agreement": true}}, "resolution": false}, "forecast": {"metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.3, "elicitation_metadata": null}, {"name": "NegChecker", "data": {"not_P": {"id": "c499147e-29b2-4033-ad1d-6bfffa36ff21", "title": "Will the South Carolina Senate not pass a total abortion ban by July 2024?", "body": "This question will resolve as YES if, by July 31, 2024, the South Carolina Senate does not successfully pass legislation enacting a total abortion ban.

For instance, the Commander of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) Admiral Fahd Al-Ghufaili visited Paris and met with the Chief of Staff of the French Navy Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, discussing various defense projects and technologies, including submarines. Additionally, Saudi Arabia and France signed an executive plan for cooperation on capabilities, military industries, and R&D, indicating a deepening of their defense ties. 2. **Economic and Energy Cooperation**: France has been engaging in talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to diversify Europe's energy supplies, aiming to reduce dependence on Russian energy sources. This indicates a new area of cooperation focused on energy security. 3. **Industrial and Technological Collaboration**: The participation of Saudi Arabia in the Eurosatory 2024 defense exhibition in Paris, where the Saudi pavilion showcased the kingdom's military industries and invited global investors, highlights efforts to enhance industrial and technological collaboration between the two countries. Given these developments, it is clear that France and Saudi Arabia have indeed implemented new forms of cooperation, particularly in defense and energy sectors, by July 2024.

Additionally, it introduced e-vouchers for loans up to Rs 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions, with an annual interest subvention of 3% of the loan amount.\n    \n    2. **Education Loan Schemes**: The government has various education loan schemes, including those offering interest subsidies and flexible repayment terms. However, these schemes primarily focus on providing financial assistance rather than specifically lowering monthly payments.\n    \n    3. **Tax Relief**: The Income-tax Act, 1961, provides tax relief under Section 80E for the interest portion of EMIs paid on education loans. This can indirectly help in managing loan repayments but does not constitute a direct plan to lower monthly payments.\n    \n    Given the information available up to July 31, 2024:\n    - The Budget 2024 announcements and existing education loan schemes aim to provide financial assistance and subsidies but do not specifically target lowering monthly payments for student loan borrowers.\n    - There is no evidence of a new initiative implemented by July 31, 2024, that directly aims to reduce monthly payments for a significant number of student loan borrowers.\n    \n    Therefore, based on the current information, the question cannot be resolved affirmatively.

According to the Maryland Department of Health's announcement on July 11, 2024, the Medicaid enrollment stood at 1,684,462 as of May 31, 2024, which is after the pandemic-related automatic enrollments were re-evaluated.\n    2. **Pre-Pandemic Enrollment**: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the enrollment was 1,415,631. The increase from this baseline to the May 2024 figure is 268,831 (1,684,462 - 1,415,631), which already exceeds 250,000.\n    3. **Relevance to Medicaid Expansion**: The question specifically refers to the Medicaid expansion program. However, the provided data sources do not distinguish between new enrollments under the expansion and other Medicaid enrollments. Given the context, the significant increase in enrollment since the pre-pandemic period can be inferred to include a substantial number of individuals covered under the expansion, but the exact figure for new enrollments under the expansion is not provided.\n    4. **Conclusion**: While the total increase in Medicaid enrollment exceeds 250,000, the specific data on new enrollments under the Medicaid expansion program is not clearly delineated in the available sources. However, considering the overall increase and the context of the Medicaid expansion, it can be reasonably inferred that the expansion program has contributed significantly to this increase, likely exceeding 250,000 new enrollments.\n\n    Given these considerations, the question can be resolved based on the available data and the reasonable inference that the Medicaid expansion program has enrolled more than 250,000 people by July 2024.", "can_resolve_question": true, "answer": true}}, "resolution": true}, "forecast": {"metadata": [{"name": "P", "elicited_prob": 0.6, "elicitation_metadata": null}, {"name": "NegChecker", "data": {"not_P": {"id": "438f9383-2e42-4e39-959a-ce10022e86f2", "title": "Will Maryland's Medicaid expansion program not enroll over 250,000 people by July 2024?", "body": "This question resolves as YES if Maryland's Medicaid expansion program has not enrolled more than 250,000 residents by July 31, 2024.

For example, in his remarks on August 14, 2024, at the 3rd General Convention for the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART), he praised the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and highlighted its benefits, including creating good-paying jobs and improving safety.\n\n    2. **Lack of Retraction or Alteration**: There is no evidence in the provided sources or recent news reports that Secretary Buttigieg has retracted or significantly altered his statements regarding President Biden's position on transportation infrastructure.
