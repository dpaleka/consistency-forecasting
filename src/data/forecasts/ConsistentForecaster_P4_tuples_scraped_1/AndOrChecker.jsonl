(b) At least 10 Democratic Senators urge Biden to withdraw before July 20?", "body": "(a) A minimum of 20 Democrats from the House or Senate endorse a public letter against the plan to virtually nominate Biden ahead of schedule: Context from Politico: Numerous House Democrats are coordinating a strategy to express their objections to their party\u2019s initiative to finalize President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination sooner than initially intended, which they claim suppresses the crucial ongoing discussion regarding his candidacy, according to a legislator involved in the initiative. A drafted letter, circulated by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO, provides the first public indication from Democrats since the recent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump that many of their own members are still quite troubled about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cThis is a really poor decision by the DNC. Someone believes it\u2019s a smart tactic to restrict debate and, by sheer force, achieve unity, but it doesn\u2019t operate that way,\u201d Huffman stated in an interview. He did not confirm the existence of a letter. This market will resolve YES if a public letter opposing the early nomination plan is endorsed by at least 20 House Members or Senators who align with the Democratic Party before the market closes at the end of Sunday, July 21st. Multiple letters with a total of 20 lawmakers' signatures would also suffice to resolve this market to YES. If these conditions are not satisfied by market close, this market resolves NO. \n\n(b) At least 10 Democratic Senators call for Biden to withdraw prior to July 20: Resolution source: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/biden-drop-out-democrats.html.

A letter drafted by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO provides the first public indication from Democrats since the recent attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump that many of their members are still quite concerned about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad move by the DNC. Someone believes it\u2019s a smart way to suppress debate and I suppose through sheer force, achieve unity, but it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman stated in an interview.
