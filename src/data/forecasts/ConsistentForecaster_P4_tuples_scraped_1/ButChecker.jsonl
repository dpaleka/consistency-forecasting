A draft letter, circulated by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and acquired by POLITICO, provides the first public indication from Democrats since the recent attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump that many of their own members remain significantly concerned about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad move by the DNC. Someone believes it\u2019s a smart tactic to stifle debate and I suppose through sheer force, achieve unity, but that\u2019s not how it operates,\u201d Huffman stated in an interview. He refrained from confirming the existence of a letter.

Two of the most endangered Democrats told local news outlets they\u2019ve already written off Biden\u2019s chances to win in November. Behind the scenes, things are even more frenzied. There are multiple drafts of letters circulating among House Democrats and at least one would call on Biden to end his campaign, according to five people familiar with the efforts. This resolves YES if a group of at least five named Democratic Party US House Members/US Senators work together to ask Joe Biden to consider ending his 2024 re-election campaign, or to urge him to do so, before Saturday July 20th (Pacific Time). This could be by signing a letter like what is reported above, but it could also be in another form such as a group speaking with Biden in person and collectively asking him to drop out. This requires that all five individuals be part of the same group message. Five people separately telling reporters they think Biden should drop out is not sufficient for a YES resolution. Reports of any number of unnamed democrats writing to Biden and asking him to step aside will not satisfy this unless at least 5 qualifying names are later made public before this end date. In any ambiguous cases where such names are reported but not confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt, this will err towards resolving NO.

One poll solicits Manifold participants to vote for Joe Biden on a hypothetical ballot, while the other requests votes for a generic Democrat on a similar ballot.\n- This market will yield a YES if the proportion of votes for Donald Trump in the first poll surpasses that in the second poll by 3% or greater upon the closing of both polls.\n- The calculation for determining the vote percentage for Trump is (Trump / (Trump + (the Democrat in question) + Someone else)). A YES answer is given if the difference between the calculation for poll 1 and that for poll 2 is at least 0.03. If not, the answer is NO.\n\n(2) Will a coalition of at least 5 specified Democratic House Members or US Senators exert pressure on Biden to withdraw before July 20th? \n- This market resolves to YES if a coalition of no fewer than five identified Democratic Party US House Members/US Senators collectively ask Joe Biden to contemplate withdrawing from his 2024 re-election campaign, or to encourage him to do so, prior to Saturday July 20th (Pacific Time).\n- This could be executed through signing a letter or another method such as a group engaging with Biden directly and collectively urging him to step aside.\n- The market stipulates that all five individuals must be part of the same collective message. If five individuals independently express to reporters their belief that Biden should withdraw, it will not suffice for a YES resolution.\n- Reports of any number of unnamed Democrats requesting Biden to step down will not meet the criteria of this market unless at least 5 qualifying names are made public prior to the market's closing date. In unclear situations where such names are reported but not confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt, this market will lean towards a NO resolution.", "resolution_date": "2024-07-23 22:24:44+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "created_date": "2024-07-04 11:04:00+00:00", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.4, "elicitation_metadata": null}}}]}}}}

Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and obtained by POLITICO, offers the first public signal from Democrats since the weekend\u2019s attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump that scores of their own members remain deeply unsettled about the future of Biden\u2019s candidacy.\n   - \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad move by the DNC. Somebody thinks it\u2019s a clever way to lock down debate and I guess by dint of sheer force, achieve unity, but it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman said in an interview.

Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and acquired by POLITICO provides the first public indication from Democrats since the recent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump that many of their members are still very concerned about Biden\u2019s candidacy going forward.\n   - \u201cThis is a very poor decision by the DNC. Someone believes it\u2019s a smart tactic to shut down debate and perhaps force unity, but that approach is ineffective,\u201d Huffman stated in an interview.
