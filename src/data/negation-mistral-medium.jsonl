{"P": "What is the probability that Ebola will be eradicated by 2030?", "notP": "What is the probability that Ebola will not be eradicated by 2030?\n\nExplanation:\nI have negated the question by adding the word 'not' to the main verb 'will be eradicated'. This changes the question to ask about the probability of the opposite outcome.\n\nNote: Demorgan's laws are rules for negating logical statements involving 'and', 'or', and 'not'. However, the original question does not contain any logical connectives, so Demorgan's laws do not apply in this case."}
{"P": "What is the probability that the Democratic party will win the US Presidential election in 2024?", "notP": "What is the probability that the Democratic party will not win the US Presidential election in 2024?\n\nExplanation:\nI have negated the question by adding the word 'not' to the phrase 'will win'. This changes the question to ask about the probability of the opposite outcome.\n\nFollowing Demorgan's laws, if the original question was asking about the probability of an event (Democratic party winning), then the negated question should ask about the probability of the complement of that event (Democratic party not winning).\n\nNote: I have avoided using the word 'won't' as per your instructions. Instead, I have used the phrase 'will not win' to express the negation."}

In this case, the original questions are asking if a certain event will happen, so the negation is asking if it is possible that the event will not happen."}
{"P": "Will Ebola be erradicated by 2030?", "notP": "Will Ebola not be eradicated by 2030?\n\nOr using De Morgan's laws:\nIs it possible that Ebola will not be eradicated by 2030?\n\nNote: De Morgan's laws state that the negation of a conjunction (and) is the disjunction (or) of the negations, and the negation of a disjunction (or) is the conjunction (and) of the negations. In this case, the original question is a conjunction of \"Ebola\" and \"eradicated by 2030\", so the negation is the disjunction of the negations \"Ebola\" and \"not eradicated by 2030\", which can be rephrased as \"Is it possible that Ebola will not be eradicated by 2030?\""}
