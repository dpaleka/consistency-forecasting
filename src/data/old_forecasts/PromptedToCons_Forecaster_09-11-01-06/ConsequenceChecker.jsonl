Given Donald Trump's significant influence in the Republican party, I estimate a relatively high probability of around 0.65 for this event.\n\n2. **not_P**: This represents the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee. Since I estimate P at 0.65, not_P would consequently be 1 - 0.65 = 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is slightly different as it asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the current political landscape, it's reasonable to assume that it is indeed possible, thus I would estimate para_P at around 0.70.\n\n4. **Q**: The likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a complex question that relies on climate models and scientific consensus. Given the current trajectory of climate change, I would estimate this at around 0.75.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question requires both events (a Trump family member being the nominee and at least 2\u02daC of warming) to occur. Given the individual probabilities, I might estimate P_and_Q at around 0.50, assuming some correlation between political action and climate policy.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This question asks if either one of the events occurs. Since both P and Q are relatively high, I would estimate this probability at around 0.85.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This requires that there be global warming but no Trump family member as the nominee. This could be less likely than P_and_Q, so I would estimate this at around 0.20.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming given that a Trump family member is the nominee. Given the current political stance on climate change, I would estimate this at around 0.70.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the relationships between these questions are intertwined, particularly between P and Q, as political decisions can impact climate change policies. I will now provide the probability estimates for each variable.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\n{neg, andor, and, or, but, cond consistency checks passed! para consistency check failed!}\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
