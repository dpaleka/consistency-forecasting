Given Trump's prominence and the potential for family members to run, I would estimate this probability to be relatively high, say around 0.65.\n\nnot_P: Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee is the complement of P. If I estimate P to be 0.65, then not_P would be 1 - 0.65 = 0.35. This reflects the uncertainty surrounding the political landscape and the potential for other candidates to emerge.\n\npara_P: The question of whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination is closely related to P. If P is 0.65, then para_P could be estimated similarly, as it reflects the same event but in a more general sense. Therefore, I would also set para_P at 0.65.\n\nQ: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a complex issue influenced by scientific models and climate policies. Given current trends and scientific consensus, I might estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.70.\n\nP_and_Q: For both events to occur, I would consider the probabilities of P and Q together. If P is 0.65 and Q is 0.70, I would estimate P_and_Q using the product of their probabilities (assuming some level of independence), leading to an estimate of around 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\nP_or_Q: This probability should account for the union of both events. Using the formula for the union of two events, P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, I would calculate this as 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This event reflects the scenario where there is global warming but no Trump family member is the nominee. Assuming some independence, I might estimate this as Q * not_P = 0.70 * 0.35 = 0.245.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of global warming given that a Trump family member is the nominee. I would need to estimate this based on the relationship between the two events. If I assume that having a Trump family member as a nominee does not significantly affect climate policy, I might set this at around 0.70 as well, similar to Q.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.46\nP_or_Q: 0.89\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.89 + 0.46 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.89 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.89 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"id": "445a4be9-6c89-4a91-9abd-474f06a8d480", "title": "Given that both the United States and Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030, will Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Both the United States and Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 01-01-2030, as reported by reliable media sources.

Given Donald Trump's strong influence within the Republican Party, I estimate a moderate to high probability that at least one family member will be the nominee.\n\n**not_P**: This is the complement of P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. This reflects the possibility that the Trump family may not secure the nomination, possibly due to other strong candidates or shifts in voter preferences.\n\n**para_P**: This question is essentially a rephrasing of P, thus I would assign it the same probability as P, which is 0.60.\n\n**Q**: The likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is grounded in scientific consensus about climate change trends. Given the current trajectory of global emissions and climate models, I would estimate this probability to be relatively high, perhaps around 0.75.\n\n**P_and_Q**: This variable represents the joint occurrence of both P and Q. Since both events are not completely independent, I would estimate this probability by considering the individual probabilities and their potential correlation. I might estimate this at 0.45, recognizing that while they are related, the occurrence of one does not guarantee the other.\n\n**P_or_Q**: This represents the occurrence of either P or Q. The probability should account for both events occurring independently and their overlap (P_and_Q). I would estimate this at about 0.80, reflecting the high likelihood of at least one of the events happening.\n\n**Q_and_not_P**: This variable captures the scenario where there is global warming of at least 2\u02daC but no Trump family member is the nominee. Given the independent nature of these events, I would estimate this probability at around 0.30.\n\n**Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming given that a Trump family member is the nominee. I would estimate this at around 0.75, as political factors related to the nominee may not significantly alter climate trends.\n\nOverall, the predictions must adhere to the consistency rules. For instance, the relationship between P and not_P must sum to 1, and the calculations for P_and_Q, P_or_Q, and the conditional probabilities must also align with the defined relationships in the rules. I will ensure that these probabilities are adjusted to satisfy all consistency checks.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.80 + 0.45 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.80 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"id": "617e44a4-49fa-4516-8983-e3b730e5ce4d", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) both the United States and Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030, and (2) Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:\n(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\n(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and negatively otherwise.

Therefore, I estimate P to be 0.65. This means that I think there is a 65% chance that one of the family members will be the nominee.\n\nFor not_P, which is the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee, this is simply the complement of P. Hence, I estimate not_P to be 0.35.\n\nThe question of whether it is possible for a member of the Trump family to secure the nomination (para_P) should have a similar probability to P, as it essentially asks the same question but in a different phrasing. I will assign para_P a value of 0.65 as well.\n\nThe question regarding global warming by 2100 (Q) is a complex issue influenced by numerous factors, including climate policies, technological advancements, and global cooperation. Given the current trajectory and scientific consensus on climate change, I estimate Q to be 0.70, indicating a 70% chance that there will be at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100.\n\nFor P_and_Q, which asks whether both P and Q will occur, I believe that the events are somewhat independent, but there is a slight correlation since political decisions can influence climate policy. For a conservative estimate, I will set P_and_Q at 0.45.\n\nP_or_Q should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it represents the occurrence of at least one of the two events. I will estimate P_or_Q to be 0.80.\n\nFor Q_and_not_P, I believe that if global warming occurs, it is possible that no Trump family member could be the nominee, depending on the political climate at that time. I will assign a lower probability of 0.20 to this outcome.\n\nFinally, for Q_given_P, if a Trump family member is the nominee, it may influence climate policies, but I still believe the underlying climate science will prevail. I will set Q_given_P at 0.65, reflecting a belief that the nominee's identity will not significantly alter the trajectory of climate change.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.65 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
