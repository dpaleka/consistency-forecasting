This is based on the current political climate, Trump's popularity within the party, and the likelihood of family members entering the race. \n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Consequently, the probability of no member of the Trump family being the nominee is 0.40. This reflects the competitive nature of the Republican primaries, where other candidates may emerge.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This is aligned with P, so I estimate it to be the same at 0.60, as it essentially asks if the event could happen.\n\n**Q (Global Warming)**: For the likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, I estimate a probability of 0.75 based on current scientific consensus and trends in climate change data.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: The probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and global warming reaching the threshold is estimated at 0.45. This reflects a multiplication of the probabilities of independent events, considering that one does not inherently affect the other but both could occur simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: For either event occurring, I estimate a probability of 0.85, which is the sum of the probabilities of P and Q, minus the probability of both occurring (P_and_Q).\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global Warming with No Trump Nominee)**: The probability of global warming occurring while no Trump family member is the nominee is estimated at 0.30, considering the independence of these events.\n\n**Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of global warming reaching the 2\u02daC mark is still high, so I estimate this at 0.70.\n\nOverall, the estimates reflect an understanding of the political landscape and climate science, adhering to the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.85 + 0.45 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.85 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.70 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\n{failed_check_cond}\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.43\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "2953fba8-befd-4624-b591-a0a8de8a8502", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) US life expectancy at birth for both sexes fall below 75 years before 2040 (b) a global thermonuclear war by 2070?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if either of the following occurs:\n(a) US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) falls below 75 years at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

Given the strong political influence and media presence of the Trump family, I estimate a probability of 0.65 for P. This reflects a reasonable belief that a Trump family member could secure the nomination.\n\n2. **not_P**: Since not_P is the complement of P, its probability will be 1 - P = 0.35. This indicates a belief that there is still a significant chance that no Trump family member will be the nominee.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the probability of P, I estimate para_P to also be high at 0.65, reflecting that it is indeed possible given current circumstances.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: Based on scientific consensus and ongoing climate trends, I estimate a probability of 0.80 for Q. This reflects a strong belief that global temperatures will rise significantly by 2100, supported by current data trends.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This prediction considers both events occurring simultaneously. Since both P and Q are independent, I can calculate this as P * Q = 0.65 * 0.80 = 0.52. This shows a strong likelihood of both events happening together.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This is calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Therefore, P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.80 - 0.52 = 0.93, indicating a high probability that at least one of these events will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This considers the scenario where Q occurs but not P. Since not_P is 0.35, I estimate Q_and_not_P as Q * not_P = 0.80 * 0.35 = 0.28. This reflects a belief that global warming could occur even without a Trump family nominee.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee. Given that political actions can influence climate policies, I estimate Q_given_P to be slightly lower at 0.75, reflecting potential political impacts on climate action.\n\nOverall, these probabilities reflect a careful consideration of current events, scientific data, and political dynamics. They also adhere to the consistency rules outlined, ensuring that the relationships between the probabilities are logically sound.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.80\nP_and_Q: 0.52\nP_or_Q: 0.93\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.93 + 0.52 - 0.80 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.80 - 1, 0) <= 0.52 <= min(0.65, 0.80) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.80) <= 0.93 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.80) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.93 - 0.28 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.52 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.80\nP_and_Q: 0.52\nP_or_Q: 0.93\nQ_and_not_P: 0.28\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
