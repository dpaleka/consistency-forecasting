Given the current political climate and Trump's established base, I estimate a moderate probability.\n\n2. **not_P** (Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?): This is the complement of P. If P has a moderate probability, not_P will have a complementary probability. \n\n3. **para_P** (Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?): This question is similar to P but slightly broader. Since it includes the possibility of any Trump family member, it can be considered equal to P in probability.\n\n4. **Q** (Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?): This question is complex and hinges on geopolitical tensions and military engagements. Given the history of US-China relations, I estimate a moderate probability of this occurring.\n\n5. **P_and_Q** (Will both the Trump family member nomination and the armed conflict leading to 100 deaths occur?): The probability of both events happening is likely less than either individual probability, as they are independent events. Thus, I expect a lower probability for this combined event.\n\n6. **P_or_Q** (Will either the Trump family member nomination or the armed conflict leading to 100 deaths occur?): This probability will be higher than either individual probability, as it accounts for the likelihood of at least one of the two events occurring.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P** (Will armed conflicts occur while no Trump family member is nominated?): This scenario combines an event with its complement. The probability should be low, as the occurrence of armed conflict does not necessarily depend on the Trump nomination.\n\n8. **Q_given_P** (Given that a Trump family member is nominated, will armed conflicts lead to 100 deaths?): This conditional probability will depend on the likelihood of armed conflict, which could be influenced by the political situation. If a Trump family member is nominated, it may change the dynamics of US-China relations, but I will estimate it conservatively.\n\nIn terms of consistency, I will ensure that the probabilities I estimate adhere to the rules provided. For instance, not_P should equal 1 - P, and P_and_Q should fall within the bounds defined by the individual probabilities P and Q. Additionally, I will check that P_or_Q is consistent with the individual probabilities. \n\nOverall, the relationships between these questions can be seen as interconnected, where the political landscape (P) may influence international relations (Q), but they are fundamentally independent events.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.35\nP_and_Q: 0.21\nP_or_Q: 0.74\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.74 + 0.21 - 0.35 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.35 - 1, 0) <= 0.21 <= min(0.60, 0.35) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.35) <= 0.74 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.35) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.74 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.21 / 0.30 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, or, but, cond, para consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.35\nP_and_Q: 0.21\nP_or_Q: 0.74\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.30\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "not_P": {"id": "b77d44e4-8b0c-487f-8d07-8f080772111b", "title": "Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\nDonald Trump\nDonald Trump Jr.\nEric Trump\nIvanka Trump\nTiffany Trump\nMelania Trump\nBarron Trump\n", "resolution_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00Z", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.6, "elicitation_metadata": {"model": "default_model", "timestamp": "2024-09-14T18:13:15.048941", "user_prompts": ["QUESTIONS: {'P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('66da35aa-2b68-424f-9e18-b0add78683b3'), title='Will a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if one of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'not_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('f479a6ca-6b12-4421-be05-bae55da1c920'), title='Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if none of these individuals is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'para_P': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('5e643677-2440-4f99-b47b-00b8415f61a6'), title='Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?', body='Resolution Criteria\\nResolves Yes if any of the following individuals becomes the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024:\\nDonald Trump\\nDonald Trump Jr.\\nEric Trump\\nIvanka Trump\\nTiffany Trump\\nMelania Trump\\nBarron Trump\\n', resolution_date=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 31, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), question_type='binary', data_source='synthetic_inst', created_date=None, url=None, metadata=None, resolution=None), 'Q': ForecastingQuestion(id=UUID('d9e86e5c-9c91-4b5a-8a93-b91b64f84775'), title=\"Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\", body=\"Resolution Criteria\\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2050, either of the following occur:\\nThere are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\\nThere are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the United States and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\\nThese 100 deaths do not have to occur in the same conflict or the same year;

This is influenced by Donald Trump's continued popularity among Republican voters and the potential candidacies of his children.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as Republican nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P, meaning if P is likely, then not_P will have a lower probability. I estimate this to be the remaining probability after assessing P.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump family member securing nomination)**: This probability is expected to be similar to P, as it essentially asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to be the nominee, which aligns with the likelihood of P occurring.\n\n4. **Q (Armed conflicts leading to 100 deaths)**: This question is more uncertain due to the complex geopolitical landscape. I estimate a lower probability here, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding potential armed conflicts between the US and China.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be lower than both P and Q individually, as it represents the intersection of both events. I estimate it based on the product of the probabilities of P and Q, considering their potential independence.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At least one event occurring)**: This will be higher than both P and Q, as it captures the scenarios where either event could happen. I will use the formula for the union of two probabilities to estimate this.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not_P is true)**: This probability will depend on the likelihood of Q occurring while simultaneously considering that no Trump family member is the nominee. It is expected to be low given the context of the questions.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given that P is true)**: This conditional probability will reflect the likelihood of Q occurring in the context where a Trump family member is the nominee, which may raise the likelihood of conflicts due to heightened political tensions.\n\nEach of these probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules provided. I will ensure that the estimates respect the relationships defined in those rules, particularly how they relate through logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

Factors such as Trump's previous presidency and existing political support contribute to this estimate. \n\n**not_P (No Trump family member nominee)**: This is the complement of P, and thus, it should naturally be lower. Since I believe there is a significant chance for a Trump family member to be nominated, the probability for not_P is lower.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination)**: This is essentially aligned with P, as if it is possible for a family member to be nominated, it indicates a high likelihood that at least one could be nominated. Thus, the probability for para_P is similar to P.\n\n**Q (Armed conflicts leading to deaths)**: The geopolitical landscape and the historical context of U.S.-China relations inform this estimate. Given the tensions, I estimate a moderate probability that conflicts might escalate to a point where they could lead to significant casualties.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occur)**: For this probability, I consider the independence of the two events. While they are not strictly independent (the political climate could influence military actions), I still estimate the joint probability to be lower than either individual probability.\n\n**P_or_Q (At least one event occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it captures the likelihood that either event could happen, thus it should reflect a more optimistic view of at least one outcome occurring.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Conflicts occur while no Trump family member is nominee)**: This reflects a situation where the conflict occurs without any Trump family member being involved politically. The probability here would depend on how likely I think the conflict is versus the likelihood of the Trump family\u2019s involvement in the nomination process.\n\n**Q_given_P (Conflicts occur given a Trump family member is nominee)**: This conditional probability looks at the likelihood of conflict occurring under the condition that a Trump family member is nominated. I expect that political tensions could escalate in such a scenario, hence the estimate might be slightly higher than Q alone.\n\nIn summary, my estimates will reflect a careful consideration of the relationships between these events, adhering to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is FALSE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nandor, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.44\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "not_P": {"id": "cfb9f9c3-3459-4456-b224-cc3ba76415aa", "title": "If Joe Biden is elected president of the US in 2020, will the highest tax bracket not be restored to its original 39.6% or higher before 2025?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Joe Biden is elected president for the 2021-2024 term, and the upper tax bracket for US single tax payers is not increased to at least 39.6% by January 1, 2025.

I estimate this probability at 0.65, reflecting a strong likelihood but acknowledging the uncertainty of political dynamics.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P should be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing nomination)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I estimate it at 0.65 as well, since it reflects the same underlying question.\n\n4. **Q (Armed conflicts leading to 100 deaths)**: Given ongoing tensions between the US and China, there is a non-negligible chance of conflict leading to casualties. I estimate this probability at 0.40 based on historical data and current geopolitical tensions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This requires both P and Q to be true. If P is 0.65 and Q is 0.40, using the multiplication rule for independent events gives P_and_Q = 0.65 * 0.40 = 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: Using the formula for the union of two probabilities, P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.26 = 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q is true while not_P is true)**: This requires Q to be true while confirming that no Trump family member is the nominee. Assuming independence, this could be estimated as Q * not_P = 0.40 * 0.35 = 0.14.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurring given P is true)**: This is a conditional probability. Assuming that if a Trump family member is the nominee, it might influence international relations, I estimate this at a slightly higher value, say 0.45.\n\nIn summary, I have made these estimates based on current political trends, historical data, and the interdependencies between the events. I will now check these estimates against the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.44\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

This reflects the intersection of both events, suggesting that if a Trump family member is nominated, it might coincide with rising tensions that could lead to conflict. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either P or Q occur?)**: I estimate this at 0.70, considering the likelihood of at least one of the events happening. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will Q occur and no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee?)**: Given the independence of these events, I estimate this at 0.15. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, will there be conflict leading to at least 100 deaths?)**: I estimate this at 0.40, as the nomination could potentially escalate tensions, but not necessarily lead to conflict. \n\nOverall, these estimates are based on current events, historical trends, and the relationships between the various events outlined in the questions.

Given the current political climate and Trump's continued influence, I estimate this probability to be relatively high.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the complement of P. If P is high, then not_P will be low. This relationship is straightforward, and I will set not_P accordingly.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump Family Nominee)**: This question is closely related to P and will likely have a similar probability, as it asks about the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination. If P is high, para_P should also be high.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts and Deaths)**: The probability of armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths is a complex issue, influenced by geopolitical tensions. Given the current state of international relations, I will assign a moderate probability to this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be true. Therefore, I will calculate this based on the individual probabilities of P and Q.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the occurrence of at least one of the two events. I will derive this from the probabilities of P and Q.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q Occurs, but not P)**: This situation requires Q to happen while ensuring that a Trump family member is not the nominee. This relationship is more complex and will require careful consideration of the probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q Occurs Given P)**: This is a conditional probability that will depend on the relationship between the two events. If P occurs, it might influence the likelihood of Q occurring, so I will estimate this based on the relationship between P and Q.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are interdependent, and I will ensure that the probability estimates respect the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.05 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.05\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
