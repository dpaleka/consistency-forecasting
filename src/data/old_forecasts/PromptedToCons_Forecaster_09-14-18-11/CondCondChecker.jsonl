This is influenced by Trump's continued popularity among the Republican base, as well as the potential candidacy of other family members.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is the complementary event to P. Given the high estimate for P, the probability for not_P is relatively low. However, there is still a possibility that another candidate could emerge as a strong contender.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing nomination)**: Since para_P is essentially asking if it is possible for a Trump family member to be nominated, it aligns closely with P. Therefore, the probability for para_P is similar to that of P.\n\n4. **Q (Armed conflicts between the US and China leading to 100 deaths)**: The likelihood of significant armed conflict between the US and China is uncertain, but given the geopolitical tensions, I estimate a moderate probability for this event. This is based on historical data and current events that suggest the possibility of conflict.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and armed conflicts leading to 100 deaths is likely lower than either event happening independently, as these events are not directly correlated.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: Since P and Q are not mutually exclusive, the probability of either occurring should be higher than the individual probabilities of both events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Conflicts occurring while no Trump nominee)**: This scenario considers the possibility of armed conflict occurring without a Trump family member as the nominee. Given the estimates, this could happen, but the probability is dependent on the likelihood of Q occurring.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Conflicts occurring given a Trump nominee)**: This conditional probability considers that if a Trump family member is the nominee, whether armed conflicts will lead to 100 deaths. The estimate would likely be influenced by the political climate and decisions made by a Trump nominee.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these events are interconnected, particularly between P and not_P, as well as P and Q. The consistency rules will ensure that these probabilities align logically.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.36\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"id": "445a4be9-6c89-4a91-9abd-474f06a8d480", "title": "Given that both the United States and Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030, will Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Both the United States and Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 01-01-2030, as reported by reliable media sources.

The predictions will be based on the relationships between these events and the consistency rules provided.\n\n1. **P (Trump Family Nominee)**: The probability that a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. Given the prominence of Donald Trump and the potential candidacies of other family members, I estimate this probability to be moderate to high, perhaps around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Member Nominee)**: This is the complementary probability to P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. This is a straightforward calculation since these two events are mutually exclusive.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump Family Member Nominee)**: This question essentially asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. It should align closely with P since if there is a chance of one member being nominated, it reflects the possibility. Therefore, I can set para_P equal to P, which is 0.60.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts Leading to Deaths)**: The probability of armed conflicts between the US and China resulting in at least 100 deaths by 2050. Given current geopolitical tensions, I might estimate this probability at around 0.30, acknowledging that such events are difficult to predict.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: This event is the intersection of P and Q, which means both a Trump family member is the nominee and there are significant armed conflicts. The probability of this occurring would be lower than either P or Q alone, so I could estimate this around 0.15.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: This is the union of P and Q. The probability of either event occurring can be calculated using the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Substituting the values gives me a probability of approximately 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P)**: This event requires that there are armed conflicts leading to deaths while no Trump family member is the nominee. This probability might be lower than Q alone, so I could estimate this around 0.10.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q given P)**: This conditional probability asks about the likelihood of Q occurring given that P has occurred. If P is true, it might influence the probability of Q. I could estimate this at around 0.35 based on the assumption that political tensions could escalate alongside the nomination of a Trump family member.\n\n**Consistency Check**: The probabilities need to be consistent with the rules provided. For example, the sum of P and not_P must equal 1. The calculations for P_and_Q and P_or_Q must adhere to their respective formulas. I will ensure that the final estimates respect these relationships.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.15 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_3, failed_check_6 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.70\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"id": "617e44a4-49fa-4516-8983-e3b730e5ce4d", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (1) both the United States and Israel recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030, and (2) Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel by 2031 if Iran does not get a nuclear bomb by then?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if both of the following occur:\n(1) Before 01-01-2030, reliable media sources report that both the United States of America and Israel have recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\n(2) If the Iran nuke question resolves negatively (i.e. the Iranian Regime credibly states it has a nuclear weapon or a weapon test, as judged by media reports), then this question will resolve positively if at least five reliable media outlets report that the State of Israel is legally recognized by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia before 2031-01-01, and negatively otherwise.

This is based on Donald Trump's previous popularity within the Republican Party and his potential candidacy. I would assign a probability estimate of around 0.65 to this event. \n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Given the probability assigned to P, the probability of not_P would be 1 - P, which would be 0.35. This reflects the possibility that other candidates could emerge as stronger contenders within the Republican Party.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Member Nomination)**: This is effectively the same as P, as it asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Therefore, I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts Leading to Deaths)**: The probability of armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050 is a complex issue. Given the historical context and current geopolitical tensions, I would assign a probability of 0.40 to this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: The probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths is likely to be lower than either individual event occurring. I would estimate this at around 0.20, considering the independence of these events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: The probability of either a Trump family member being the nominee or armed conflicts leading to deaths would be higher than both occurring together. I would estimate this at around 0.75.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Conflicts Occur and No Trump Nominee)**: This scenario involves the occurrence of conflicts while no Trump family member is the nominee. I would estimate this at around 0.15, considering the independence of these events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Conflicts Given Trump Nominee)**: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of armed conflicts leading to deaths might increase due to heightened political tensions. I would estimate this at around 0.50.\n\nIn summary, I believe these events are interconnected, particularly P and Q, as the political climate can influence international relations.

I estimate this probability at **0.65**.\n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Member Nominee)**: Since I estimate P at 0.65, I can calculate not_P as **0.35** (1 - P).\n\n**para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Member Nomination)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I also set this at **0.65**.\n\n**Q (Armed Conflicts with China)**: Assessing the geopolitical landscape, while tensions exist, the likelihood of an armed conflict leading to 100 deaths is uncertain. I estimate this probability at **0.25** based on the historical context of US-China relations and the potential for diplomatic resolutions.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: The joint probability of both events occurring would be influenced by the independence of these events. I estimate this probability at **0.15**, considering that the nomination and potential armed conflict are not directly dependent but could influence public sentiment.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. This gives us **0.65 + 0.25 - 0.15 = 0.75**.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Conflict Occurs and No Trump Family Member Nominee)**: I estimate this probability at **0.10** based on the likelihood of conflict occurring without the Trump family being involved in the nomination process.\n\n**Q_given_P (Conflict Given Trump Family Nominee)**: If a Trump family member is the nominee, I estimate the likelihood of conflict remains similar, so I set this at **0.25**.\n\n### Summary of Estimates:\n- P: 0.65\n- not_P: 0.35\n- para_P: 0.65\n- Q: 0.25\n- P_and_Q: 0.15\n- P_or_Q: 0.75\n- Q_and_not_P: 0.10\n- Q_given_P: 0.25\n\n### Consistency Considerations:\n- The relationship between P and not_P is straightforward; they must sum to 1.\n- The calculations for P_and_Q and P_or_Q must adhere to the established rules of probability, ensuring that they do not exceed logical bounds.\n- The independence of the events is critical in calculating joint probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.25\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.15 - 0.25 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.25 - 1, 0) <= 0.15 <= min(0.65, 0.25) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.25) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.25) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.15 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{neg, andor, and, cond consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.25\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.70\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "Q_given_P": {"id": "635788eb-e0e5-45fa-916f-92a7e0362590", "title": "Given US greenhouse gas emissions are halved by 2030, will commercial animal farming be prohibited in the US before 2041?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nThis question resolves positively if there is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO\u2082 equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030.

I estimate this at 0.40, considering the potential for conflict but also the diplomatic efforts in place.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability that both a Trump family member is the nominee and armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths is likely lower than either event occurring independently. I estimate this at 0.20, factoring in the low likelihood of both happening simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone. Using the formula for the union of two events, I estimate this at 0.75, considering the overlap between the two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while not P)**: This scenario is plausible if there are armed conflicts but no Trump family member is the nominee. I estimate this at 0.15.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This conditional probability will likely be higher than the overall probability of Q, as the political climate may influence military actions. I estimate this at 0.50.\n\n**Consistency Checks**: The estimates must adhere to the consistency rules provided. For instance, not_P must equal 1 - P. The relationships between P and Q will also need to comply with the rules of conjunction and disjunction.\n\nIn conclusion, the estimates are based on a blend of current political trends and potential geopolitical conflicts, while ensuring adherence to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"id": "b96ee53d-0d74-4811-8bbf-89570e0d5cbd", "title": "Will US greenhouse gas emissions be halved by 2030, will commercial animal farming be prohibited in the US before 2041, and if Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not admitted as new states, will Republicans hold the Senate from 2022 to 2030?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question resolves positively if all of the following occur:\n(a) There is any year between 2022 and 2030 (inclusive) in which the US levels of economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions (in terms of CO\u2082 equivalents) is at least 50.00% lower than 2005 levels, according to a reliable source that is not heavily disputed by other reliable sources. The question resolves negatively if all reliable reports (that Metaculus users can find) say that the US net emissions in each year between 2022 and 2030 were greater than 50% of 2005 levels, and there is at least one reliable report about net emission levels in 2030. (If there is no report about net emission levels in 2030, we should wait for one rather than resolving this question ambiguously.) If the US gains or loses territories between now and 2030, ideally only the net emissions from the current territories should be considered.\n(b) The US government passes legislation or the US constitution has been amended or interpreted by the Supreme Court to prohibit commercial animal farming before December 31, 2040.\n(c) Both Washington DC and Puerto Rico are not officially admitted as new states before December 31, 2029, and the Republican Party controls the Senate from the beginning of the congressional term in 2023 to the end of the congressional term in 2031 (the 118th through 121st congresses, inclusive).

I will assign a probability of 0.65 to P.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary event to P, so I will calculate not_P as 1 - P, resulting in a probability of 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This is similar to P, as it assesses whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Since I believe this is indeed possible, I will assign it the same probability as P, 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts with China)**: The geopolitical tensions between the US and China have been rising, but predicting specific events leading to 100 deaths by 2050 is complex. Given the uncertainty, I will assign a probability of 0.40 to Q.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to occur. Assuming some correlation between the likelihood of a Trump family member being nominated and the potential for conflict escalation, I'll estimate P_and_Q at 0.26.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event encompasses either P or Q occurring. Using the probabilities I have assigned, I will calculate this as P + Q - P_and_Q, resulting in a probability of 0.79.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to occur while not P is true. Given my estimates, I will assign a low probability of 0.15 to this event, as it seems less likely that a conflict would arise without a Trump family member being involved.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of Q occurring given that P is true. I will assign it a probability of 0.50, reflecting that if a Trump family member is nominated, it might increase tensions leading to conflict.\n\nOverall, I believe these estimates reflect a reasonable assessment based on the current political climate and international relations.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n{failed_check_1, failed_check_2 ... consistency checks failed!}\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

Given Donald Trump's previous presidency and ongoing influence, I estimate this probability at a moderately high level, say **0.65**.\n\n**not_P:** This is the complement of P, representing the chance that no Trump family member will be the nominee. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be **0.35**.\n\n**para_P:** This question essentially asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination, which is inherently aligned with P. Therefore, I would assign it the same probability as P, which is **0.65**.\n\n**Q:** The question regarding armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths is contingent on geopolitical tensions. Given recent events and the potential for conflict, I estimate this probability at **0.30**.\n\n**P_and_Q:** For both P and Q to be true, we need a Trump family member to be the nominee and for there to be serious armed conflict resulting in deaths. Given the independence of these events, I estimate this probability as the product of P and Q, which would be **0.65 * 0.30 = 0.195**.\n\n**P_or_Q:** This represents the probability of either event occurring. Using the formula for the union of two events, I calculate this as P + Q - P_and_Q, which gives **0.65 + 0.30 - 0.195 = 0.755**.\n\n**Q_and_not_P:** This scenario considers the chance of armed conflict occurring while no Trump family member is the nominee. I estimate this as the product of Q and not_P, resulting in **0.30 * 0.35 = 0.105**.\n\n**Q_given_P:** This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of armed conflict given that a Trump family member is the nominee. I expect this to be higher than Q alone due to the potential implications of a Trump nomination on US-China relations. I estimate this at **0.40**.\n\nOverall, I believe these estimates are consistent with the relationships outlined in the consistency rules, and I will now check for compliance.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.195\nP_or_Q: 0.755\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.755 + 0.195 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.195 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.755 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.755 - 0.105 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.195 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and, or, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.195\nP_or_Q: 0.755\nQ_and_not_P: 0.105\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "R_given_P_and_Q": {"id": "ab929ded-5b67-49c2-821f-3b05c75ac291", "title": "Conditional on both a new amendment to the US Constitution being ratified by 2050 and the United States continuing to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, will the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\n(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:\nThe US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992.

This reflects the current political climate, Donald Trump's significant influence, and the possibility of other family members running.\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Given the estimate for P, I calculate not_P as 1 - P, which results in 0.35. This indicates a reasonable chance that no Trump family member will secure the nomination.\n3. **para_P (Possible Trump Nominee)**: This probability is expected to be equal to P, so I also set this at 0.65, reinforcing that it is indeed possible for a Trump family member to be nominated.\n4. **Q (China-Us Conflict Deaths)**: I estimate a lower probability of 0.30 for this scenario, considering the historical context, ongoing tensions, and the potential for military engagements that could lead to significant casualties.\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: Given the independent nature of these events, I estimate this at 0.20, reflecting that while both could happen, it is less likely than either occurring alone.\n6. **P_or_Q (At Least One Occurs)**: This is calculated using the formula: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q, leading to an estimated probability of 0.75.\n7. **Q_and_not_P (China Conflict with No Trump Nominee)**: I estimate this as 0.15, indicating a scenario where there are conflicts but no Trump family member is nominated.\n8. **Q_given_P (China Conflict Given Trump Nominee)**: I estimate this at 0.25, considering the potential implications of a Trump family member being in a position of power during a conflict.\n\n### Consistency Checks:\n- **Negation Rule**: The relationship between P and not_P is consistent, as not_P is correctly calculated as 1 - P.\n- **And/Or Rules**: The relationships among P, Q, P_and_Q, and P_or_Q need to be checked for consistency as they can influence each other's probabilities. Given the independent nature of P and Q, the calculations should hold true.\n- **Conditional Probability**: The estimation of Q_given_P reflects the likelihood of conflict given the Trump family\u2019s nomination, which is crucial for understanding the implications of these events.\n\nOverall, the estimates are designed to reflect the current political landscape and potential future scenarios while adhering to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q_and_R": {"id": "98499ffc-5672-4025-8bfb-f446075fd989", "title": "Will all of the following occur: (a) a new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050, (b) the United States continue to be among the 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability over the 2019-2029 period, according to the Fragile States Index, and (c) the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution be amended or repealed before 2025?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\n(a) A new amendment to the US Constitution be ratified by 2050:\nThe US Constitution has been amended 27 times in its history, most recently in 1992.

Given the political context and the prominence of Donald Trump in recent elections, I estimate this probability to be relatively high. However, considering the potential for other candidates to emerge, I will set this probability at around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee. Since I estimated P at 0.65, I will set not_P at 0.35 (1 - P).\n\n3. **para_P**: This probability reflects the possibility that a Trump family member could secure the nomination. Given the same reasoning as P, this will also be set at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q**: The probability that armed conflicts between the USA and China will lead to at least 100 deaths by 2050. Given the current geopolitical tensions, I will estimate this probability at 0.40.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This represents the joint probability that both a Trump family member is the nominee and that there are significant casualties due to conflict. I will estimate this at a lower value, say 0.25, considering that both events are somewhat independent but not entirely.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: The probability that either event occurs (either a Trump family member is the nominee or significant conflict occurs). This will be calculated using the formula for the union of two probabilities: P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Plugging in my estimates, this will be 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.25 = 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This is the probability that there will be significant conflict, and no Trump family member is the nominee. I will estimate this at 0.15, recognizing that this scenario is plausible but less likely than others.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of significant conflict occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee. I will set this at 0.45, as the nomination could influence international relations and tensions.\n\nIn summary, I believe these estimates reflect the current political landscape and the potential for conflict, while also adhering to the consistency rules outlined. Each probability is interrelated, and adjustments to one will likely impact others, particularly the joint and conditional probabilities.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
