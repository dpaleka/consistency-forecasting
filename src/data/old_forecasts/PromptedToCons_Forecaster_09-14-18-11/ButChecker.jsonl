Given Donald Trump's prominence and previous candidacy, I estimate a moderate to high probability that one of the Trump family members will be nominated. \n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the direct negation of P. If I estimate P to be high, not_P will naturally be low. \n\n**para_P (Possibility of Trump Nominee)**: This question asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Since P is estimated to be high, para_P will also be high, as it directly relates to the potentiality of P being true. \n\n**Q (US-China Conflict)**: This question involves whether armed conflicts between the US and China will lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050. Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, I estimate a moderate probability for this event, reflecting the uncertainty and potential for conflict.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: This question combines P and Q, so it will depend on the probabilities of both events occurring. If both P and Q have reasonable probabilities, then P_and_Q should reflect a lower probability than either event individually, since both must occur simultaneously. \n\n**P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This question asks if at least one of the events (P or Q) occurs. This probability should be higher than either of the individual probabilities since it encompasses both outcomes.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Conflict with No Trump Nominee)**: This question explores the scenario where there is conflict (Q) but no Trump family member is nominated (not_P). The probability of this event will depend on the interplay between Q and not_P.\n\n**Q_given_P (Conflict Given Trump Nominee)**: This question asks if there will be conflict given that a Trump family member is the nominee. The relationship here is conditional, and I would expect the probability to reflect how likely conflict is when a Trump family member is involved in politics.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities will be interrelated based on the definitions and logical relationships outlined in the consistency rules. I will ensure that all probabilities are adjusted to respect these relationships.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"id": "1b820938-dbbc-4bc3-b026-81653fb113b4", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) We find life on Mars by 2050 and (b) Europa is not the first place humanity discovers extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:\n(a) Prominent, highly respected scientific organizations announce that humans have discovered unambiguous evidence of current or past life on Mars, independent of life that was carried from Earth to Mars via human-designed missions, before January 1, 2050.\n(b) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life anywhere other than Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life on Europa.

If P is 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40. \n\n### para_P: Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis question is essentially asking if there is any chance that P could occur, so I would align this with P's probability, making it 0.60 as well. \n\n### Q: Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?\nThis is a complex geopolitical question. Given current tensions, I might estimate this probability at around 0.30. \n\n### P_and_Q: Will both a member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee and armed conflicts lead to 100 deaths?\nThis is a conjunction of P and Q. The probability should reflect both events occurring, which would be lower than either P or Q alone. I could estimate this probability to be around 0.18, assuming some correlation between political tensions and military conflicts. \n\n### P_or_Q: Will either a Trump family member be the nominee or armed conflicts lead to 100 deaths?\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, this probability should be higher than both individual probabilities. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.30, I might estimate P_or_Q to be around 0.72. \n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will armed conflicts lead to 100 deaths while no Trump family member is the nominee?\nThis reflects a scenario where Q occurs but not P. I might estimate this to be around 0.12, considering that both events are not necessarily dependent on each other. \n\n### Q_given_P: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, will armed conflicts lead to 100 deaths?\nThis conditional probability would depend on the assumption that political tensions could lead to military actions. If I estimate Q at 0.30, I might estimate this as 0.25 given the context of P. \n\n### Summary of Independence and Relationships\nP and Q are not independent; political dynamics can influence military actions and vice versa. The estimates for P and Q reflect a balance of current political climates and geopolitical tensions. The probabilities for combined events (like P_and_Q) reflect the intersections of these influences. \n\n### Consistency Checks\nI will ensure that all the probabilities I estimate adhere to the consistency rules provided, such as negation, conjunctions, and disjunctions.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.70\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "6cb1df14-8bff-4753-aa37-a1cdacb52fd9", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) Europa be the first place humanity will discover extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045?

His previous presidency and ongoing influence suggest a higher probability that he, or another family member, could be the nominee. I estimate this probability to be around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complement of P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, indicating a reasonable chance that no member of the Trump family secures the nomination.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is closely related to P, as it essentially asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given that P is estimated at 0.65, I would anticipate para_P to be slightly higher, around 0.75, reflecting that while there is a possibility, it is not guaranteed.\n\n4. **Q (US-China conflict)**: The geopolitical tensions between the US and China have been increasing, which raises concerns about potential armed conflicts. However, predicting a specific number of deaths (at least 100) is complex. I would estimate this probability at 0.30, considering the historical context and current diplomatic efforts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This probability reflects the likelihood of both a Trump family member being the nominee and the occurrence of significant armed conflict between the US and China. Given the independence of these events, I would estimate this at around 0.20.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This represents the probability that either event occurs. Given the estimates for P and Q, I would expect this to be higher than both individual probabilities, likely around 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This probability reflects the scenario where there is significant conflict, but no Trump family member is nominated. I would estimate this at around 0.15, taking into account the independence of the events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of conflict given that a Trump family member is the nominee. I would estimate this at around 0.25, as the political climate could influence international relations and conflict likelihood.\n\nI will ensure that all these probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided, adjusting as necessary to maintain logical coherence.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.75\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.75 is FALSE\n\nfailed_check_and, failed_check_cond, failed_check_para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

This is based on Trump's continued influence in the party and the potential candidacies of his children.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the direct opposite of P. If I estimate P at a certain level, not_P will be accordingly lower. It is important to consider the dynamics of the Republican primaries and the possibility of other candidates rising.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This question is essentially about the feasibility of a Trump family member becoming the nominee. Given the context, this should have a similar probability to P, as it is asking if it is possible rather than certain.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts with China)**: The probability of armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths is a complex assessment. Given current geopolitical tensions, I would estimate a moderate probability, considering the potential for conflict escalation.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: This probability combines the likelihood of a Trump family member being the nominee and the occurrence of armed conflict with China. Given that both events are relatively independent, the combined probability should reflect the individual probabilities.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurring)**: This is a broader question that covers either event happening. The estimate for this probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses both scenarios.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Conflict Occurs and No Trump Nominee)**: This scenario combines the likelihood of conflict with the absence of a Trump nominee. The interaction between these two events needs careful consideration, as they may not be entirely independent.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Conflict Given Trump Nominee)**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of conflict if a Trump family member is the nominee. The relationship between these two events could suggest a higher likelihood of conflict due to increased political tensions.\n\nOverall, the probabilities should reflect the relationships and dependencies among these events, ensuring that they adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.38 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"id": "e55516d3-6d76-43d6-b4c0-dbb6b3d9574f", "title": "Will there be a global thermonuclear war by 2070 and will US life expectancy at birth for both sexes never fall below 75 years before 2040?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following conditions are met:\n1.

If I estimate P at a certain level, not_P will be 1 minus that estimate. \n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This question is similar to P but is framed in a more general way. If I believe P has a certain probability, then para_P should have a similar or slightly higher probability since it asks if it is possible rather than certain. \n\n4. **Q (Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?)**: Given current geopolitical tensions, I would estimate a probability that this conflict could lead to significant casualties, but the exact probability would depend on various factors, including diplomatic relations and military actions. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both a Trump family member be the Republican nominee and armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?)**: This is a conjunction of P and Q. The probability of both occurring would generally be lower than either occurring alone, so I would estimate this probability accordingly. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either a Trump family member be the Republican nominee or armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?)**: This is the union of P and Q. The probability here should be higher than either P or Q individually, as it encompasses situations where either could occur. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths, and no Trump family member be the nominee?)**: This question combines Q with the negation of P. The probability would depend on the likelihood of Q occurring while also considering the probability of not P. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, will armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?)**: This conditional probability would likely be influenced by the political climate and how it may affect international relations. \n\nOverall, I need to ensure that my estimates for these probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided, particularly with respect to the relationships between these events.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.68\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.68 is FALSE\n\nneg, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "91ff6a8f-4fbb-4709-aa46-2d7091afed09", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) US life expectancy at birth for both sexes fall below 75 years before 2040?

Given Donald Trump's previous presidency and ongoing influence, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability to this event. \n\nnot_P: This probability represents the opposite scenario, where none of the Trump family members secure the nomination. Factors such as the emergence of strong alternative candidates or a shift in Republican voter sentiment could increase this probability.\n\npara_P: This question is closely related to P, as it essentially asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the current landscape, if P is likely, then para_P should also reflect a similar probability.\n\nQ: The probability of armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths before 2050 depends on geopolitical tensions, military engagements, and historical precedents. The situation is complex, but given the current state of international relations, a moderate probability seems appropriate.\n\nP_and_Q: This event combines the probabilities of P and Q occurring simultaneously. The likelihood of both events happening may be less than either occurring independently, thus necessitating careful consideration of their interaction.\n\nP_or_Q: This probability reflects the likelihood that at least one of P or Q occurs. Given that both events are somewhat independent, the probability should be higher than either event alone but not necessarily the sum of both.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This scenario requires both Q to happen while P does not. This could happen if there are conflicts that lead to casualties without a Trump family member as the nominee, which needs careful estimation.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability examines the likelihood of Q occurring if P is true.

Given the current political climate and Trump's strong base, I estimate this probability to be relatively high.\n\n2. **not_P** (Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?) \n   - This event is the direct negation of P. Therefore, its probability is complementary to P. If P is estimated at a certain value, not_P must reflect that as 1 - P.\n\n3. **para_P** (Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?) \n   - This question is closely related to P. If P has a certain probability, then para_P should have a similar or slightly higher probability, as it encompasses the possibility of the event occurring without committing to it.\n\n4. **Q** (Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?) \n   - The likelihood of this event is influenced by geopolitical tensions and historical patterns of conflict. Given the ongoing tensions, I will estimate this probability at a moderate level.\n\n5. **P_and_Q** (Will both P and Q occur?) \n   - This represents the joint occurrence of both events. The probability of both occurring should reflect the independent probabilities of P and Q, taking into account any correlation between the two.\n\n6. **P_or_Q** (Will either P or Q occur?) \n   - This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the possibility of either event occurring. It will be calculated using the formula for the union of two events.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P** (Will Q occur while not P occurs?) \n   - This question assesses the simultaneous occurrence of Q and the negation of P. The probability of this scenario will depend on the independent probabilities of Q and not_P.\n\n8. **Q_given_P** (Given that P occurs, will Q occur?) \n   - This conditional probability will reflect the likelihood of Q occurring under the assumption that P has occurred. It will be influenced by the relationship between the two events.\n\nIn summary, I will assign probabilities based on the relationships between these events, ensuring that the estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided. Each event's probability will be calculated taking into account its dependencies and the overall political and geopolitical context.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q_and_not_P": {"id": "db7fda66-e20e-4fe6-a51f-e34cf1f89f3a", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) The USA enters a second civil war before 2031 (b) There is never a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following conditions are met:\n(a) The USA enters a second civil war before January 1, 2031.

Given the historical context and media coverage, I estimate this probability at around 0.60.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P, calculated as 1 - P. Therefore, not_P would be 0.40.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P but framed in a way that considers the possibility rather than certainty. Thus, para_P should be slightly higher than P, around 0.65, as it allows for a broader interpretation of the question.\n\n4. **Q (US-China Conflict)**: The probability of armed conflicts leading to 100 deaths is based on historical data and current geopolitical tensions. Given the unpredictability of international relations, I estimate this probability at 0.30.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This represents the joint occurrence of both events. Since both events are somewhat independent, I estimate this probability as the product of P and Q, which would be approximately 0.60 * 0.30 = 0.18.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This is the probability that at least one of the events occurs. It can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, P_or_Q would be 0.60 + 0.30 - 0.18 = 0.72.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This represents the occurrence of Q while not_P is true. This is a more complex calculation, but it could be estimated as Q * not_P, which gives approximately 0.30 * 0.40 = 0.12.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This is the conditional probability of Q given that P is true. Assuming that the occurrence of a Trump nominee has some influence on the likelihood of conflict (though not directly), I estimate this at around 0.35.\n\n### Consistency Rules:\n- **neg**: The relationship between P and not_P should be consistent.\n- **andor**: The relationship between P, Q, P_and_Q, and P_or_Q must hold true.\n- **and**: The relationship between P_and_Q and the individual probabilities must be valid.\n- **or**: The P_or_Q must be consistent with the individual probabilities.\n- **but**: The relationship between P, P_or_Q, and Q_and_not_P must hold.\n- **cond**: The conditional probability must reflect the relationship accurately.\n- **para**: para_P should be equal to P.\n\n### Independence:\nP and Q are independent events; the outcome of one does not affect the other directly. However, their combined probabilities must still adhere to the consistency rules outlined. \n\nOverall, my estimates are grounded in current political and global contexts, and I will ensure all probability estimates follow the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.65 is FALSE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2, failed_check_3, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.16\nP_or_Q: 0.69\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}, "P_or_Q": {"id": "6017ab32-c74d-496d-bca5-04503bb79edb", "title": "Will either of the following occur: (a) a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120, or (b) the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?", "body": "(a) Will there be a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120?\nResolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\nFine Print\nWe'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\n\n(b) Will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?\nResolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\nThe Insurrection Act is invoked.\nWhile the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\nAll of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\nFine Print\nAny conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

Given Trump's previous presidency and ongoing influence, I estimate this probability to be moderately high.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary event to P. If P is relatively high, then not_P must be lower, reflecting the binary nature of these events.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is essentially asking if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. This should align closely with P, as if P is likely, para_P should also be high.\n\n4. **Q (China Conflict)**: The likelihood of armed conflicts between the US and China resulting in at least 100 deaths is a complex issue, influenced by geopolitical tensions, military engagements, and historical precedents. Given the current state of relations, I estimate this probability to be moderate.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: For both events to occur, both the nomination and the conflict must happen. This probability should be lower than either individual event's probability, as it requires both conditions to be met.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This is the probability that at least one of the events occurs. Given that both P and Q have some likelihood, this probability should be higher than either of the individual probabilities.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event considers the scenario where there is conflict with China, but no Trump family member is nominated. This could be influenced by the overall political climate in 2024, where if tensions rise, it might distract from political nominations.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of conflict given that a Trump family member is the nominee. This might be higher if the nominee is perceived as more aggressive or confrontational regarding foreign policy.\n\nIn terms of consistency, I will ensure that the estimates respect the mathematical relationships defined in the CONSISTENCY RULES, particularly focusing on the binary nature of the events and their interdependencies.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.36\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.36 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.36\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}
