Given Trump's previous nomination and strong base, I estimate a relatively high probability for P.\n\n2. **not_P (Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This is the direct complement of P. Therefore, if P is estimated at a high probability, not_P will be correspondingly low. \n\n3. **para_P (Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?)**: This question is closely related to P and should have a similar probability since if P is likely, it is also possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. \n\n4. **Q (Will armed conflicts between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic of China lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050?)**: Given the current geopolitical tensions, I see a moderate probability for this event. Historical patterns of conflict and escalation might support the likelihood of this outcome. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Will both occur: a Trump family member is the nominee and armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths?)**: The probability of both events occurring is likely lower than either event occurring independently. Thus, I would estimate this probability to be less than both P and Q. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Will either occur: a Trump family member is the nominee or armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths?)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses both events. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Will both occur: armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths and no Trump family member is the nominee?)**: This probability is likely to be low, as it combines the occurrence of Q with the non-occurrence of P, which could be somewhat independent but still might have overlapping influences. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, will armed conflicts lead to at least 100 deaths?)**: This conditional probability may be informed by the political climate surrounding the nominee and the actions taken during that time. If a Trump family member is in power, it might influence international relations and conflicts. \n\nOverall, the relationships between these events suggest that predictions for P and not_P are inversely related, while P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P will be influenced by the probabilities of P and Q. The estimates should reflect these relationships, ensuring that consistency rules are followed.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.40 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "05ddf956-d523-498f-a81b-c03e87cbd332", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) US life expectancy at birth for both sexes fall below 75 years before 2040 and (b) a global thermonuclear war by 2070?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:\n(a) At any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

This reflects ongoing tensions between the US and China, but the uncertainty of actual armed conflict occurring. \n\nP_and_Q: The probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and the armed conflict question being true might be estimated at 0.18, reflecting the combined likelihood of both events occurring. \n\nP_or_Q: The probability of either event occurring would be higher than either event alone, so I would estimate this at around 0.72. \n\nQ_and_not_P: This probability would reflect the likelihood of the armed conflict occurring while no Trump family member is the nominee. I would estimate this at around 0.12, which considers the potential for conflict irrespective of the political situation. \n\nQ_given_P: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the likelihood of armed conflict might increase slightly due to heightened political tensions, so I would estimate this at 0.35. \n\nOverall, the relationships between these questions show some independence, but also some correlations, particularly between P and Q given their political implications.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2, consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.70\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

The probability is influenced by current political trends, potential challengers, and the family's political capital. \n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is the complement of P. Therefore, it should be estimated as 1 - P. This relationship is straightforward as it follows the negation rule. \n\n3. **para_P (Possible Trump family nominee)**: This question is similar to P, as it asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Since the possibility is inherently tied to the probability of P, I would estimate this probability to be slightly higher than P, reflecting the uncertainty and potential for unexpected developments in the political landscape. \n\n4. **Q (Armed conflicts with China leading to 100 deaths)**: Given the geopolitical tensions between the US and China, there is a non-negligible chance that armed conflicts could escalate to the point of causing significant casualties. However, this is difficult to predict, so I would assign a moderate probability. \n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q individually, as it requires both events to occur simultaneously. I will calculate this based on the estimated probabilities of P and Q, considering their potential independence. \n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q alone, as it encompasses the possibility of either event occurring. I will calculate this by using the appropriate formula that accounts for the overlap between the two events. \n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q happens while no Trump family member is nominee)**: This scenario requires the occurrence of Q while ensuring that no Trump family member is the nominee. This will be a more complex estimate, as it involves the interaction of both events. \n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q given P)**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of Q occurring if a Trump family member is the nominee. It may be higher than the unconditional probability of Q due to potential geopolitical dynamics influenced by the election. \n\nOverall, the relationships between the questions (especially between P and not_P, as well as between P and Q) will guide my estimates to ensure they adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.79 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.79 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\nneg, and, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.79\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q_given_P": {"id": "c255e351-d0b4-480a-8a4a-a7011ffda915", "title": "Conditional on Europa being the first place humanity discovers extraterrestrial life before 2045, will we find life on Mars by 2050?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045, and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

Given the prominence of the Trump family in politics, I estimate a probability of around 0.65 for this event occurring.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: The complement of P, this probability would be 1 - P. Therefore, I estimate not_P to be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump Family Nominee)**: This question is essentially the same as P, as it asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Thus, I would assign the same probability of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts Leading to Deaths)**: This event relies on geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Given the current trajectory of international relations, I estimate a lower probability of 0.40 for this event occurring.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occurring)**: This event requires both a Trump family member to be the nominee and for armed conflicts to lead to deaths. Assuming some correlation between political tensions and international conflicts, I estimate this joint probability to be around 0.25.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (At Least One Event Occurring)**: This probability would be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion: P + Q - P_and_Q. Thus, I estimate P_or_Q to be 0.65 + 0.40 - 0.25 = 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Conflicts Occurring Without Trump Family Nominee)**: This scenario would require conflicts to occur while no Trump family member is nominated. I estimate this probability to be around 0.15, considering that the events are somewhat independent.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Conflicts Given Trump Family Nominee)**: This conditional probability would depend on the likelihood of conflicts occurring in the context of a Trump nominee. I estimate this to be higher than the base rate for Q, perhaps around 0.50, given that political tensions may rise with a Trump nomination.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that all these probabilities adhere to the consistency rules provided, adjusting them as necessary to ensure they pass all checks.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.50 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 ... consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "756dd07d-0a1e-465f-aefd-426b31e31077", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) Europa will be the first place humanity will discover extraterrestrial life, if it is discovered before 2045, and (b) we will find life on Mars by 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following occur:\n(a) Humanity discovers convincing evidence of life on Europa before January 1, 2045 and does so before detecting extraterrestrial life anywhere else in the universe.

Given the prominence of Donald Trump and his family's involvement in politics, I estimate this probability to be relatively high but not certain. \n\nnot_P: This is the complementary event, and its probability will be derived from the estimate of P. \n\npara_P: This question is similar to P but framed in a way that emphasizes the possibility rather than certainty. It should have a similar probability to P, as it covers the same potential outcomes. \n\nQ: The probability of armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths by 2050 is influenced by geopolitical tensions, historical context, and current military engagements. Given the unpredictable nature of international relations, I estimate this probability to be moderate. \n\nP_and_Q: This probability represents the intersection of P and Q, meaning both events occur simultaneously. Given that both events can influence each other, I will estimate this probability lower than either P or Q alone but still significant. \n\nP_or_Q: This represents the union of P and Q, where at least one of the two events occurs. This probability should be higher than either individual probability. \n\nQ_and_not_P: This captures the scenario where there are armed conflicts resulting in deaths, but no Trump family member is the nominee. This will also influence the probabilities of the other events, especially P. \n\nQ_given_P: This is a conditional probability that assesses the likelihood of armed conflicts leading to deaths given that a Trump family member is the nominee.

I will estimate this probability at around 0.65.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is the direct negation of P. Given that P is estimated at 0.65, not_P should be estimated at 0.35 (1 - P).\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination)**: This is similar to P, and I would expect it to have a similar probability, as it asks if it is possible for a family member to secure the nomination, which is likely. I will estimate this at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Armed conflicts leading to 100 deaths)**: This question is more uncertain. Given the current geopolitical climate, I would estimate this probability to be lower, around 0.30, as it relies on specific events occurring in the future.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events happening)**: The probability of both P and Q happening is likely to be lower than either P or Q alone.

This reflects the current political climate and the likelihood of his continued relevance.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complement of P. If P is estimated at 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35, representing the chance that no Trump family member secures the nomination.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P and should have the same probability because it essentially asks the same thing, thus I would also estimate it at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts and Deaths)**: The geopolitical tensions between the United States and China suggest that the probability of armed conflicts resulting in significant casualties is moderate. I might estimate this at around 0.40, considering the historical context of military engagements.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question assesses the intersection of both events. The probability of both happening would be lower than either happening independently, so I would estimate it at 0.20, reflecting a conservative view on both events occurring simultaneously.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This probability would be higher than either individual probability, as it considers the occurrence of at least one of the events. I would estimate this at around 0.75, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these scenarios will occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question considers the occurrence of armed conflicts while no Trump family member is nominated. Given the estimates, I would put this at around 0.15, as it combines the likelihood of two independent events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability would reflect the likelihood of armed conflict given that a Trump family member is the nominee. It might be slightly higher than Q alone due to the political climate, so I would estimate it at around 0.45.\n\nOverall, the estimates reflect an understanding of the political dynamics at play and the historical context of U.S.-China relations.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nneg, and: cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.15\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "8e453edb-1c7a-4e61-bdf1-d27ecac8e7ff", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) There be a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120 and (b) The USA enter a second civil war before 2031?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:\n(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\n(b) All of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\n- The Insurrection Act is invoked.\n- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\n- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\nFine Print\nFor condition (a), we'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\nFor condition (b), any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

This is based on Donald Trump's continued influence within the party and the potential for his family members to run, given the political landscape.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the complement of P, and thus I estimate it to be 0.35. This reflects the possibility that another candidate may emerge as a strong contender, or that the Trump family may not secure the nomination.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This is closely related to P and not_P, and I estimate it to be equal to P since if P is true, then it is certainly possible.\n\n4. **Q (US-China Armed Conflicts)**: I estimate a low probability (around 0.30) that armed conflicts between the US and China will lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050. Given the geopolitical tensions, while there is a potential for conflict, it is uncertain whether it would escalate to this level.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: This probability is more complex as it involves the occurrence of both P and Q. I estimate it to be around 0.20, reflecting the likelihood that both a Trump family member could be nominated and significant conflict could arise.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, so I estimate it to be around 0.75. This reflects the potential for either event to happen, given the current political climate and international relations.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs while no Trump nominee)**: I estimate this to be around 0.15, reflecting the situation where armed conflict occurs without a Trump family member being nominated.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given Trump nominee)**: This conditional probability would likely be higher than Q alone, so I estimate it to be around 0.35, reflecting that if a Trump family member is nominated, it may correlate with increased tensions leading to conflict.\n\nThe relationship between these probabilities is essential, as the events are interlinked. For example, the nomination of a Trump family member (P) might influence international relations and the likelihood of conflict (Q). The consistency rules will help ensure that the probabilities align logically.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.20 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.20 <= min(0.65, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.30) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.20 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.20\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}
