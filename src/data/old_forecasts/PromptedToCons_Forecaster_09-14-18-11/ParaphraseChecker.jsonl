Given Donald Trump's strong influence and previous nomination, I would estimate a moderately high probability for P.\n\nFor not_P, this would simply be the complement of P, which would reflect the possibility that none of the Trump family members secure the nomination. If P is high, not_P will be relatively low.\n\nThe para_P question, which asks about the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination, should align closely with P, as it essentially asks if the event is possible. Thus, its estimate should be similar to P.\n\nFor the question about armed conflicts between the United States and China leading to at least 100 deaths (Q), I would analyze historical data, current geopolitical tensions, and military engagements to assess the likelihood of such an event occurring. Given the ongoing tensions, I would assign a moderate probability to Q.\n\nP_and_Q represents the joint probability of both events occurring. This would be lower than either P or Q alone since it requires both conditions to be true. P_or_Q would be higher than either individual probability since it accounts for either event occurring.\n\nQ_and_not_P would assess the scenario where armed conflicts occur, but no Trump family member is the nominee. This could be influenced by the overall political climate and how it might affect military engagements.\n\nQ_given_P is a conditional probability that would assess the likelihood of armed conflict if a Trump family member is indeed the nominee. This could involve evaluating how the nomination might influence foreign policy or military decisions.\n\nOverall, I expect the relationships between these probabilities to be consistent with the provided rules, as they are logically interconnected, particularly through the concepts of independence and conditionality.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.14\nQ_given_P: 0.38\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.14 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.38 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.36\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

Given Donald Trump's previous presidency and continued influence within the Republican Party, I estimate the probability of this event as moderate to high. However, the political landscape can change rapidly, and other candidates may emerge, which could affect this probability.\n\n**not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Given the same reasoning, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee is inversely related to P. If P is estimated at 0.60, then not_P would be around 0.40.\n\n**para_P (Possible Trump Family Nominee)**: This is closely related to P, as it simply asks if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Since P is positive, I would assign a probability close to P, perhaps slightly higher due to the nature of the question being less strict.\n\n**Q (Armed Conflicts with China)**: The probability of armed conflicts between the US and China resulting in at least 100 deaths is a complex issue. Given current geopolitical tensions, I estimate this probability to be moderate, but less than P, as actual conflicts can be unpredictable.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: To estimate this, I would consider the intersection of P and Q. If both events are somewhat likely but not guaranteed, the probability of both occurring would be lower than either individually.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This probability should be higher than both P and Q since it includes the possibility of either event occurring. If P is 0.60 and Q is 0.40, P_or_Q would be estimated higher than both.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Conflict Occurs, No Trump Nominee)**: This question asks for the intersection of Q occurring while not P occurs. This would likely be a lower probability than Q alone since it requires a specific condition about the Trump family not being nominated.\n\n**Q_given_P (Conflict Given Trump Nominee)**: This conditional probability would focus on the likelihood of conflict occurring if a Trump family member is the nominee. Given the political climate and potential for escalation, I would estimate this as moderate.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these probabilities are interconnected, especially between P and not_P, and P_and_Q and Q_and_not_P. The consistency rules will help ensure that these probabilities align logically.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.18\nP_or_Q: 0.72\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.72 + 0.18 - 0.30 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.30 - 1, 0) <= 0.18 <= min(0.60, 0.30) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.30) <= 0.72 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.30) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.72 - 0.12 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.18 / 0.25 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.65 is FALSE\n\nand, cond, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.30\nP_and_Q: 0.17\nP_or_Q: 0.70\nQ_and_not_P: 0.12\nQ_given_P: 0.25\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}, "para_P": {"id": "1900e48e-28ad-4118-9075-e623b2a8d28c", "title": "Will the cost of water on the NQH20 reach $2,500 (2021 USD) per acre-foot by the year 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as 'Yes' if the cost of water reaches $2500, adjusted for inflation to 2021 USD, on the NQH20 by 2050-01-01, 00:00 UTC.

This reflects the uncertainty in political dynamics and potential challengers.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump family member as nominee)**: This is likely to align closely with P, so I estimate it at 0.65 as well, indicating that it is indeed possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination.\n\n4. **Q (Armed conflicts leading to deaths)**: The probability of armed conflicts between the US and China leading to at least 100 deaths is estimated at 0.40. Given the ongoing tensions, this seems plausible, though the exact timeline and nature of such conflicts are uncertain.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and armed conflicts leading to deaths is estimated at 0.25. This reflects the interdependence of these events, as political situations can influence military actions and vice versa.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: The probability of either event occurring is expected to be higher, around 0.70, as both scenarios can unfold independently, and at least one is likely to happen.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Armed conflicts and no Trump nominee)**: The probability of armed conflicts occurring while no Trump family member is the nominee is estimated at 0.15. This reflects the possibility of conflicts arising regardless of the political landscape.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Trump nominee, will there be deaths)**: Given that a Trump family member is the nominee, the probability of armed conflicts leading to deaths is estimated at 0.35. This recognizes the political influence on military decisions but acknowledges the uncertainty of conflict outcomes.\n\nIn terms of consistency, I will ensure that all these estimates adhere to the defined rules, particularly the relationships between P and not_P, as well as the logical dependencies between Q and the other variables.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.70\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.25 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.25 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.25 / 0.35 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand, cond consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.35\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

Given the prominence of Donald Trump in recent political history and the potential for his family members to enter the race, I estimate this probability at around 0.65. This reflects the possibility of either Donald Trump himself or one of his children stepping into the political arena, which is a plausible scenario.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Since this is the complement of P, I estimate this at 0.35. This reflects the uncertainty of the political landscape and the possibility that other candidates may emerge.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Nomination)**: This is likely to be similar to P, as it concerns the potential for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. I estimate this also at 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Armed Conflicts with China)**: The probability of armed conflicts leading to at least 100 deaths is more uncertain, given the geopolitical tensions but also the potential for diplomatic resolutions. I estimate this probability at 0.40, acknowledging the risks involved but also the possibility of avoiding large-scale conflicts.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: This probability would be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both events to happen simultaneously. I estimate this at 0.26, reflecting the combined uncertainty of both predictions.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This probability should be higher than either individual event but not excessively high. I estimate this at 0.70, acknowledging that at least one of these events is likely to occur.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Q occurs but not P)**: This probability is more complex, as it requires Q to occur while P does not. I estimate this at 0.15, reflecting the possibility of conflict without a Trump family member being the nominee.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Q occurs given P)**: This is a conditional probability and should be reflective of the intersection of both events. I estimate this at 0.45, indicating that if a Trump family member is nominated, the likelihood of conflict may increase due to heightened political tensions.\n\n### Consistency Checks:\n- The relationships between these probabilities are governed by the consistency rules provided. \n- For instance, since P and not_P are complementary, their probabilities should sum to 1. \n- Similarly, the and/or rules will ensure that combined probabilities do not exceed logical limits. \n- The conditional probabilities should reflect the dependencies correctly, ensuring that the predictions align with the potential scenarios outlined in the questions.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.26\nP_or_Q: 0.70\nQ_and_not_P: 0.15\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.70 + 0.26 - 0.40 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.40 - 1, 0) <= 0.26 <= min(0.65, 0.40) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.40) <= 0.70 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.40) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.70 - 0.15 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.26 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.40\nP_and_Q: 0.24\nP_or_Q: 0.76\nQ_and_not_P: 0.16\nQ_given_P: 0.40\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}, "para_P": {"id": "07c43859-579b-49f6-b577-ffdf38f00e13", "title": "Is it expected that the Forethought Foundation will employ over two full-time equivalent staff members by 2025?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nIn this context, a full-time equivalent is considered to be someone working 35 hours per week, excluding volunteers.
