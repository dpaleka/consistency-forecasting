Given the current political landscape and Donald Trump's continued prominence in the Republican party, I estimate a relatively high probability for this event. \n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complement of P, indicating that no Trump family member will be the nominee. Since I have assigned a high probability to P, the probability for not_P will be correspondingly low.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question inquires whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the current political dynamics, I believe that it is indeed possible, thus assigning a probability similar to P.\n\n4. **Q**: This question addresses global warming and whether there will be at least a 2\u02daC increase by 2100. The scientific consensus indicates a significant risk of reaching this threshold, so I will assign a moderate probability to this event.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question combines P and Q, asking if both events occur. Since I have assigned relatively high probabilities to both P and Q, I will estimate a probability that reflects the likelihood of both happening simultaneously. \n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This question checks if either P or Q occurs. Given that both P and Q have reasonably high probabilities, I will estimate this probability to be higher than either P or Q alone.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question examines the likelihood of global warming occurring while no Trump family member is nominated. Since these events can be somewhat independent, I will assign a lower probability here, reflecting the potential for either outcome.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional question asks if global warming will occur given that a Trump family member is nominated. Depending on the political decisions made during the Trump administration, this may influence environmental policies. I will assign a probability based on this conditional relationship.\n\nIn summary, I will ensure that the probabilities assigned obey the consistency rules, particularly the relationships between P, not_P, and the conditional probabilities. I will also ensure that the probabilities for combined events (P_and_Q, P_or_Q) reflect the interactions between these two sets of events.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.86 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.86 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.86 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.55 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nand consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q_given_P": {"id": "a322ee30-1325-44c8-b54a-e5eb2b23ce5b", "title": "Conditional on US life expectancy at birth for both sexes falling below 75 years before 2040, will there be a global thermonuclear war by 2070?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, at any time between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2040, US life expectancy at birth (average for both sexes) is less than 75 years, according to the CDC, World Health Organization, or the United Nations.

This reflects both the likelihood of Trump retaining influence and the possibility of a family member emerging. \n\n**not_P**: The complement of P would then be not_P, which I estimate at 0.35. \n\n**para_P**: This variable is essentially a restatement of P, so I will assign it the same probability of 0.65. \n\n**Q (Global Warming)**: Scientific consensus indicates that global warming is a significant risk, and with current trends, I estimate a high probability of 0.80 for Q, reflecting the urgency of climate change discussions and actions. \n\n**P_and_Q**: The joint event of both P and Q occurring is likely but not guaranteed. I estimate this at 0.50, as the political landscape could influence climate policies. \n\n**P_or_Q**: The probability of either P or Q occurring is higher than either event alone, so I estimate this at 0.85. \n\n**Q_and_not_P**: This event signifies that global warming will occur while no Trump family member is nominated. Given the political dynamics, I assign this a probability of 0.20. \n\n**Q_given_P**: If a Trump family member is nominated, the likelihood of global warming being a significant issue remains high, so I estimate this at 0.75. \n\nIn summary, the variables are interrelated, especially P and Q, which can influence each other.

Each question is interrelated, and the probabilities must be consistent with one another according to the provided consistency rules.\n\n**P**: The probability that a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 is influenced by current political trends, public sentiment towards the Trump family, and their standing within the Republican party. Given that Donald Trump remains a prominent figure, I estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.65.\n\n**not_P**: This is the complementary probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee. Since I estimate P at 0.65, not_P would be 0.35. This relationship must hold true according to the negation rule.\n\n**para_P**: This question is phrased to assess the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination, which is effectively the same as P. Thus, I would assign it the same probability of 0.65.\n\n**Q**: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a complex issue influenced by climate models and current trends. Given the urgency of climate change discussions and projections from scientific bodies, I estimate this probability to be around 0.70.\n\n**P_and_Q**: This event requires both P and Q to be true. The likelihood of both occurring is generally lower than either occurring separately. I estimate this probability to be 0.50, reflecting a significant overlap in the events but acknowledging the independent uncertainties.\n\n**P_or_Q**: This event will resolve positively if either P or Q occurs. Using the or rule, I would estimate this to be higher than either individual probability, around 0.85, reflecting the likelihood that at least one of these significant events will occur.\n\n**Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to be true while not P is also true. Given the estimated probabilities, I would assign this a lower estimate, around 0.20, reflecting the possibility of climate change occurring without the Trump family being involved in the nomination.\n\n**Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of Q occurring given that P is true. Since the nomination of a Trump family member may influence climate policy discussions, I would estimate this probability to be around 0.75, indicating a strong likelihood of climate change discussions if a Trump family member is nominated.\n\nOverall, the estimates are interconnected, and adjustments to one will likely affect others, so careful consideration of the consistency rules is critical.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.85 + 0.50 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.85 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.85 - 0.20 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

Given the current political landscape, this probability can be estimated at 0.40.\n\npara_P: The question of whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination is closely related to P. If P is true, then para_P is also likely true. Thus, I estimate para_P at 0.60 as well.\n\nQ: The prediction regarding global warming by 2100 is based on current climate models and trends.

Each question can be analyzed based on its relationship with the others and the implications of their outcomes.\n\n1. **P (Trump Family Nominee)**: This question asks whether a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024. Given the prominence of Donald Trump and his family's involvement in politics, I estimate a moderate to high probability that one of them will be the nominee. The estimate is reasonably set at 0.65, reflecting both public sentiment and potential political dynamics.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complementary question, asking if no member of the Trump family will be the nominee. Since this is the opposite of P, the estimate should be 1 minus the probability of P, which would be 0.35.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question inquires if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. This is essentially a rephrasing of P, so I expect it to have the same probability estimate of 0.65.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: This question assesses whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100. Given current climate trends and scientific consensus, I estimate a high probability of 0.75 that this will occur.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This question combines P and Q, asking if both conditions will be met. The probability will depend on the individual probabilities of P and Q, but it should be lower than either P or Q alone. I estimate this to be around 0.50, reflecting some correlation between political climate and environmental policy decisions.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This question asks if either P or Q will happen. Given that both P and Q have a reasonable probability of occurring, I estimate this to be higher than the individual probabilities, around 0.80.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This question inquires if global warming will occur while no Trump family member is the nominee. This is a more specific scenario, and I estimate this to be lower, around 0.40, reflecting the potential for political influence on environmental policy.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional question asks if global warming will occur, given that a Trump family member is the nominee. This could potentially influence environmental policies, and I estimate this probability to be around 0.70, reflecting a moderate likelihood of global warming irrespective of political outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the estimates are interrelated, and adjustments to one will affect others due to the logical relationships defined by the questions. I will ensure that all estimates adhere to the consistency rules provided.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.40\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.50 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.50 <= min(0.65, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.75) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.75) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.40 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.50 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.50\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.40\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

This is influenced by Trump's popularity among Republican voters and the potential candidacy of his children.\n\n2. **not_P (No member of the Trump family as Republican nominee)**: This is the direct negation of P. Given the estimate for P, I would expect this to be relatively low. If P is high, not_P must be low, as they are complementary events.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination)**: This is closely related to P, and since P is estimated to be high, I would also estimate para_P to be high, as it reflects the likelihood of the event occurring.\n\n4. **Q (At least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100)**: This question is independent of the Trump-related questions. However, based on current climate models and trends, I would estimate a moderate probability that we will see at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100, given the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: The probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and significant global warming happening is likely lower than either event occurring independently. This is because while both events can happen, the occurrence of one does not necessarily affect the other.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone, as it accounts for the likelihood of at least one of the events happening. Given that both events have a reasonable chance of occurring, I would estimate this to be high.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global warming occurs, and no Trump family member is the nominee)**: This scenario considers the independence of the events. Since Q is estimated to be moderate and not_P is low, the combined probability should reflect this relationship.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given a Trump nominee, will there be global warming?)**: This is a conditional probability. Given that the nomination of a Trump family member does not significantly influence climate change, I would estimate this to be similar to Q.\n\nOverall, I will ensure that the estimates respect the consistency rules provided, particularly the logical relationships between the events.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.86 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.86 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.86 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1: and consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.33\nP_or_Q: 0.82\nQ_and_not_P: 0.27\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}, "Q_given_P": {"id": "b36e20fb-cd9f-4187-8beb-6840580b0e2b", "title": "Conditional on there being a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120, will the USA enter a second civil war before 2031?", "body": "Resolution Criteria for P:\nThis question will resolve positively if there is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\nFine Print for P:\nWe'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\n\nResolution Criteria for Q:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if all of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\nThe Insurrection Act is invoked.\nWhile the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\nAll of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\nFine Print for Q:\nAny conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

Given Donald Trump's previous presidency and ongoing influence, I estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.65. This estimate considers the likelihood of either Donald Trump or another family member securing the nomination.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: Since not_P is the complement of P, it should logically be 1 - P. Therefore, if P is estimated at 0.65, not_P would be 0.35. This relationship is straightforward and adheres to the negation consistency rule.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This question is similar to P, as it asks about the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination. Given the same reasoning, I estimate para_P to also be around 0.65, reflecting the same political dynamics.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The probability for Q is more complex, as it involves long-term climate predictions. Given current scientific consensus and trends, I estimate this probability to be moderate, around 0.60, as there is substantial evidence suggesting that global temperatures are rising.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: For this combined event, I consider the intersection of P and Q. Since both events are likely but not guaranteed, I estimate P_and_Q at around 0.40. This reflects the possibility that both a Trump family member could be nominated and global warming could reach the specified threshold.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This estimate would be higher than both individual probabilities because it includes scenarios where either P or Q occurs. I estimate this at 0.75, reflecting a higher chance of at least one of the events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming and No Trump Nominee)**: This scenario is less likely than P_and_Q, as it requires global warming to occur while also not having a Trump nominee. I estimate this at 0.25, considering the independent likelihood of both events.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Global Warming Given Trump Nominee)**: This conditional probability is interesting because it assumes P is true. If a Trump family member is the nominee, I believe that the probability of global warming reaching the threshold remains similar to Q, so I estimate this at around 0.60.\n\n**Independence and Relationships**: The events P and Q are somewhat independent; the nomination of a Trump family member does not directly influence climate change. However, the political landscape can impact climate policy, so there is a slight correlation. The consistency rules will need to be checked to ensure all relationships hold mathematically.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "8e453edb-1c7a-4e61-bdf1-d27ecac8e7ff", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) There be a full year with no open stock exchanges in the US by 2120 and (b) The USA enter a second civil war before 2031?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve positively if both of the following conditions are met:\n(a) There is a period of at least 12 consecutive months before the end of 2120 during which there are no public US stock exchanges open for trading.\n(b) All of the following conditions are met before January 1, 2031:\n- The Insurrection Act is invoked.\n- While the Insurrection Act is invoked, there are at least 500 deaths in a 6 month period as a result of armed conflicts between US residents and a branch of the US military, national guard, or in conflicts between/among such branches.\n- All of these deaths occur in any US state(s) (including DC).\nFine Print\nFor condition (a), we'll use the definition of stock market/exchange on Investopedia (archive):\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.\nFor condition (b), any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.

This reflects the current political landscape where Donald Trump remains a prominent figure in the Republican Party, and there is a possibility that he or another family member could secure the nomination. Conversely, the probability of not having a Trump family member as the nominee (not_P) is therefore 0.40.\n\nThe question regarding the possibility of any Trump family member securing the nomination (para_P) is closely related to P, so I will assign it the same probability of 0.60.\n\nFor the question about global warming (Q), I estimate a probability of 0.45 for there being at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100. This is based on current climate trends and scientific projections, which indicate a significant likelihood of reaching this threshold if current emissions continue.\n\nThe joint occurrence of both events (P_and_Q) should be less than or equal to both P and Q. I estimate the probability of both a Trump family member being the nominee and at least 2\u02daC of warming to be 0.27. This reflects the fact that while both events are plausible, their joint occurrence is less likely.\n\nThe probability of either event occurring (P_or_Q) should be higher than either individual event. Given my previous estimates, I anticipate this probability to be around 0.73.\n\nFor the scenario where there is global warming and no Trump family member is the nominee (Q_and_not_P), I estimate a probability of 0.18. This reflects the possibility of climate change occurring without the involvement of a Trump family member in the nomination.\n\nLastly, for the conditional probability (Q_given_P), I believe that if a Trump family member is the nominee, the likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of warming remains around 0.45, as political factors would not significantly alter the trajectory of climate change.\n\nIn summary, the probabilities reflect the interconnectedness of political and environmental factors, and I have ensured that they adhere to the consistency rules.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.45\nP_and_Q: 0.27\nP_or_Q: 0.73\nQ_and_not_P: 0.18\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.73 + 0.27 - 0.45 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.45 - 1, 0) <= 0.27 <= min(0.60, 0.45) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.45) <= 0.73 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.45) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.73 - 0.18 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.27 / 0.45 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nfailed_check_1, failed_check_2 consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.55\nnot_P: 0.45\npara_P: 0.55\nQ: 0.45\nP_and_Q: 0.25\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.20\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.55", "steps": 6}}}}

After World War II and beginning in the Cold War, Korea was divided into two countries along the 38th parallel (now the Korean Demilitarized Zone). In 1950, North Korea invaded the South, beginning the Korean War, which ended in stalemate in 1953.\nEven after the end of the Korean War, reunification proved a challenge as the two countries became increasingly diverged at a steady pace. However, in the late 2010s, relations between North and South Korea warmed somewhat, beginning with North Korea's participation at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

This is influenced by the historical significance of the Trump family in recent elections, as well as the potential candidacy of Donald Trump himself, which makes this event likely. \n\n### not_P: Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\n- This is the direct negation of P, and thus its probability should be complementary to that of P. If P is high, not_P will be low. \n\n### para_P: Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?\n- This is essentially a rephrasing of P, and since it asks whether it is possible, I would expect this to have a similar probability to P. \n\n### Q: Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\n- The likelihood of significant global warming is a pressing concern globally, and scientific consensus suggests that reaching this threshold is plausible given current trends. Therefore, I will assign a moderate to high probability to this event. \n\n### P_and_Q: Will both occur: (1) a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, and (2) there is at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\n- The probability of both events occurring is likely lower than either event occurring independently. The relationship between the two events is not directly dependent, but they can both happen simultaneously. Thus, I will estimate this probability as a function of both individual probabilities, reflecting the intersection of these events. \n\n### P_or_Q: Will either occur: (a) A member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024? (b) There be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\n- The probability of either event occurring will be higher than either event alone due to the nature of 'or' in probability. I will use the formula to calculate this based on individual probabilities. \n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will both occur: (1) There will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, and (2) no member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\n- This is a specific intersection of events where global warming occurs, but the Trump family does not nominate a member. This will likely have a lower probability than Q alone since it requires not_P to be true as well. \n\n### Q_given_P: Given that a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\n- This conditional probability will likely reflect the overall trend of climate change regardless of political events, so I would expect it to be similar to Q, but I will consider the potential influence of political action on climate policy in my estimate. \n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, I will ensure that the estimates reflect the relationships and dependencies between these events while adhering to the consistency rules provided. Each estimate will consider the implications of the events on each other, especially in the context of political dynamics and climate change.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.86 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.86 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.86 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\nfailed_check_1: and consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.85\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "Q_given_P": {"id": "48ace400-1fe4-4625-a1ee-bfa5ade83622", "title": "Conditional on North Korea and South Korea being recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045, will the United States withdraw from any of its current mutual defence treaties by 2030?", "body": "Suppose the following is true: North Korea and South Korea are recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045.

The key events to consider are whether a member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024 (P), whether no member of the Trump family will be the nominee (not_P), whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination (para_P), whether there will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 (Q), and various combinations of these events (P_and_Q, P_or_Q, Q_and_not_P, Q_given_P). \n\n1. **P (Trump Nominee)**: My estimate for P reflects the current political climate and the prominence of the Trump family within the Republican Party. Given Trump's previous presidency and ongoing influence, I believe the probability is relatively high.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is simply the complement of P. If P is high, then not_P must be lower, reflecting the likelihood that no Trump family member will be the nominee.\n\n3. **para_P**: This is expected to be equal to P, as the possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination is inherently tied to the actual nomination itself.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The estimate for Q is based on current climate science and projections. There is a significant consensus among scientists that we are on track for at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100, so I expect this probability to be relatively high as well.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This represents the joint probability that both events occur. Given that both P and Q are reasonably high, I would expect P_and_Q to also be significant, but not as high as either P or Q individually.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This measures the likelihood that at least one of the events occurs. Since both events are quite likely, this probability should be high.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This captures the scenario where there is significant global warming but no Trump family member is the nominee. This is a more nuanced situation and would likely be lower than P_and_Q.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming occurring if a Trump family member is the nominee. Given the current political discourse around climate change, I would expect this to be a significant probability as well.\n\nIn terms of independence, P and Q are largely independent events; the nomination of a Trump family member does not directly influence climate change outcomes. However, the relationships between the combined events (like P_and_Q) will need to satisfy the consistency rules outlined.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.80 + 0.45 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.80 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.80 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.45 / 0.65 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.80\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.65\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "64683455-984d-42f5-a83a-72f82634682f", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) North Korea and South Korea be recognized as a unified sovereign state by 2045 and (b) the United States withdraw from any of its current mutual defence treaties by 2030?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\n(a) Will North Korea and South Korea be recognized as a single sovereign state by 2045?\nThe question resolves positively if either:\nNorth Korea and South Korea (or their respective descendants if they change name) merge.\nor\nNorth Korea, South Korea or both (or their respective descendants if they change name) stop existing, and an entity (possibly the one that's left) controls 90%+ of the current North Korea + South Korea landmass and has its capital on that territory.\nResolution will be by reputable source that either has happened, as judged by Metaculus mods/admins.\n\n(b) Will the United States withdraw from any of its current mutual defence treaties by 2030?\nThis question resolves positively if a credible source reports completion of a process for the USA to withdraw from any of the following treaties: Rio Treaty, North Atlantic Treaty, ANZUS Treaty and bilateral defence treaties with Philippines, South Korea and Japan.\nThis question resolves positively if a credible source reports that the USA withdrew military or financial support from any of the above treaties without following the process of withdrawal outlined in the relevant treaties for a continuous period of one year.\nIf a sufficient number of parties to any of the above treaties (other than the USA) withdraws (as above) for the treaty to be dissolved, this does not count towards a positive resolution.

Given Donald Trump's previous presidency and continued influence, I estimate a moderate probability of 0.65 for this event.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the complement of P, indicating that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee. If P is 0.65, then not_P should be 0.35. This follows the negation rule.\n\n3. **para_P**: This question is similar to P, asking if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the same reasoning as P, I estimate this at 0.65 as well.\n\n4. **Q**: The question regarding global warming by 2100 is complex, depending on numerous factors including climate policies, technological advancements, and global cooperation. I estimate a higher probability of 0.70 for this event based on current trends in climate science and data predictions.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This compound event requires both P and Q to be true. Given the independence of these events, I can estimate this at P * Q = 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This event requires either P or Q to be true. The formula for this is P + Q - P_and_Q. Hence, I estimate this as 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This event requires Q to be true while not_P is also true. Assuming independence, this can be estimated as Q * not_P = 0.70 * 0.35 = 0.245.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability asks for the likelihood of Q given that P is true. Since P and Q are not directly dependent, I will estimate this as similar to Q, so I will set it at 0.70.\n\nIn summary, the relationships between these probabilities are governed by logical consistency rules, and I have ensured that my estimates reflect these relationships.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.46\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.90 + 0.46 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.46 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.90 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.46 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.46\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

The key questions involve the likelihood of a member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee and whether global temperatures will rise by at least 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.\n\n**P (Trump family member as nominee)**: This question revolves around the political landscape leading up to the 2024 elections. Given Donald Trump's significant influence in the Republican Party, I estimate a relatively high probability for this event. Political dynamics, public sentiment, and potential challengers will play a crucial role in this outcome.\n\n**not_P (No Trump family member as nominee)**: This is the complement of P. As the probability of P is estimated high, the probability of not_P will be lower. The relationship is straightforward as they must sum to 1.\n\n**para_P (Possibility of a Trump family member securing the nomination)**: This is essentially the same as P, so the probability should align closely with it. \n\n**Q (Global warming by 2100)**: The likelihood of at least 2 degrees Celsius of warming is influenced by current climate trends and international policies on emissions. Given the current trajectory of climate change, I estimate a moderate probability for this outcome.\n\n**P_and_Q (Both events occurring)**: This probability will be lower than either P or Q alone, as it requires both conditions to be met simultaneously. The estimation will depend on how likely each event is independently.\n\n**P_or_Q (Either event occurring)**: This probability will be higher than either P or Q, as it accounts for the occurrence of at least one of them. However, it cannot exceed 1.\n\n**Q_and_not_P (Global warming occurs while no Trump family member is nominee)**: This combination requires Q to be true while simultaneously negating P. The probability will be influenced by the probabilities of both events and their independence.\n\n**Q_given_P (Global warming given a Trump family member as nominee)**: This conditional probability will consider how the political landscape may affect climate policy and action. If a Trump family member is the nominee, it may influence climate action positively or negatively, impacting the probability of Q.\n\nOverall, the relationships between these probabilities must adhere to the consistency rules outlined, ensuring that the probabilities make logical sense when considered together.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.50\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.55\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.75 + 0.40 - 0.50 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.50 - 1, 0) <= 0.40 <= min(0.65, 0.50) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.50) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.50) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.75 - 0.10 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.40 / 0.55 is FALSE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\n\ncond consistency check failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.50\nP_and_Q: 0.40\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.10\nQ_given_P: 0.45\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "P_and_Q": {"id": "bdf09fac-38ed-40fa-9edd-d8a8feb8efc4", "title": "Will both of the following occur: (a) a \"World War Three\" before 2050 and (b) the price of water on the NQH20 hit $2,500 (2021 USD) per acre-foot by 2050?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if both of the following conditions are met:\n(a) There is a military conflict involving countries representing in totality at least 30% of world GDP in PPP or 50% of world population in any year in which the conflict is ongoing, and at least 10 million people (civilians or military personnel) have been killed in the conflict, at any time between January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2050.\n(b) The price of water hits $2500, adjusted for inflation to 2021 USD, on the NQH20 by 2050-01-01, 00:00 UTC.

The questions are interrelated, particularly through the logical connections between the outcomes of the Trump family's candidacy and the state of global warming. \n\n**P**: The probability estimate for a member of the Trump family being the Republican nominee is influenced by current political trends, public opinion, and the popularity of the Trump family within the Republican Party. Given Donald Trump's previous presidency and continued influence, I estimate this probability to be relatively high.\n\n**not_P**: This is the complement of P, which means if P is high, not_P should be low. The probability of no Trump family member being the nominee is inversely related to P, and I expect it to reflect a significant chance that at least one family member will run.\n\n**para_P**: This is likely to be similar to P, as it asks if it's possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. The presence of multiple family members increases this likelihood.\n\n**Q**: The probability of at least 2\u00b0C of global warming by 2100 is based on current climate models and trends. Given the trajectory of global emissions and climate change data, this is a significant concern, leading to a moderate probability estimate.\n\n**P_and_Q**: This represents the scenario where both a Trump family member is the nominee and there is significant global warming. The probability here would be lower than for P alone, as it requires both conditions to be true simultaneously.\n\n**P_or_Q**: This probability should be higher than either P or Q alone because it encompasses the possibility of either event occurring. Since both events can happen independently, this will reflect a broader range of outcomes.\n\n**Q_and_not_P**: This scenario considers the occurrence of significant global warming while no Trump family member is the nominee. This is a more niche scenario and would likely have a lower probability than Q alone, but still significant given the global warming trend.\n\n**Q_given_P**: This conditional probability focuses on the likelihood of global warming given that a Trump family member is the nominee. This relationship could be influenced by the nominee's stance on climate policy, which could affect the probability.\n\nOverall, the estimates will need to adhere to the consistency rules, ensuring that the probabilities align logically with one another, particularly with respect to complements and dependent events.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.55\nP_and_Q: 0.30\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.75 + 0.30 - 0.55 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.55 - 1, 0) <= 0.30 <= min(0.60, 0.55) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.55) <= 0.75 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.55) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.75 - 0.25 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.30 / 0.50 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.55\nP_and_Q: 0.30\nP_or_Q: 0.75\nQ_and_not_P: 0.25\nQ_given_P: 0.50\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}
