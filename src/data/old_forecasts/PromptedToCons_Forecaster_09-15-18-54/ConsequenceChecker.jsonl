Given the current political landscape, I estimate this probability at **0.65**.\n\n2. **not_P**: This is the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee. This probability is complementary to P, so it can be calculated as **1 - P**. Therefore, **not_P** will be **0.35**.\n\n3. **para_P**: This probability indicates whether it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Given the current political climate, I believe this is very likely, so I estimate it at **0.65** as well.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The likelihood of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is based on scientific consensus and current trends in climate change. Given the ongoing evidence of rising temperatures, I estimate this probability at **0.70**.\n\n5. **P_and_Q**: This represents the probability that both events (a Trump family member being the nominee and global warming reaching 2\u02daC) will happen. Since both events are not dependent on each other, I can estimate this by multiplying their probabilities: **P_and_Q = P * Q = 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455**.\n\n6. **P_or_Q**: This is the probability that either event occurs. Using the formula for the union of two independent events, **P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q = 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895**.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P**: This probability indicates that global warming occurs while no Trump family member is the nominee. Since these events are independent, I can calculate it as **Q * not_P = 0.70 * 0.35 = 0.245**.\n\n8. **Q_given_P**: This conditional probability reflects the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee. Since I assume these events are independent, I estimate this probability to be the same as Q, which is **0.70**.\n\nIn summary, the estimates are based on current political and environmental trends. The relationships between the events are carefully considered to ensure that they obey the consistency rules. I will now check these estimates against the consistency rules to ensure they are valid.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.455\nP_or_Q: 0.895\nQ_and_not_P: 0.245\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.895 + 0.455 - 0.70 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.70 - 1, 0) <= 0.455 <= min(0.65, 0.70) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.70) <= 0.895 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.70) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.895 - 0.245 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.455 / 0.70 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.65 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.70\nP_and_Q: 0.455\nP_or_Q: 0.895\nQ_and_not_P: 0.245\nQ_given_P: 0.70\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}, "cons_P": {"id": "87a31523-9c46-4cc8-bc67-6e705daef0cc", "title": "Will the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact reach 40% of the Electoral college before 2030?", "body": "Resolution Criteria\nThis question resolves positively if at least five reliable media sources report that states representing at least 40% of Electoral College votes have signed the NPVIC before 2030.", "resolution_date": "2029-12-31T00:00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": null, "url": null, "metadata": {"topics": [], "background_info": "The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is a an agreement among states to award all of their electoral votes to the candidate with the highest popular vote, conditional on enough states agreeing that the total electoral vote count would secure a majority in the electoral college.

Factors influencing this estimate include Donald Trump's significant support base and the potential candidacy of other family members, which keeps the Trump name relevant in the political discourse.\n\n### not_P: Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis probability will be inversely related to P. If I estimate P at 0.65, then not_P would logically be 0.35. However, this estimate is subject to changes based on political developments leading up to the nomination.\n\n### para_P: Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis question is closely related to P, and I estimate it to be slightly higher than P since it allows for more possibilities (including scenarios where multiple family members might run). Therefore, I will estimate this at 0.70.\n\n### Q: Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\nThis estimate is influenced by current climate change trends and scientific consensus regarding global warming. Given the ongoing climate issues, I estimate this probability at 0.60, considering the urgency of climate action and the potential for significant global temperature increases.\n\n### P_and_Q: Will both of the following occur: (1) a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, and (2) there is at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\nFor this combined event, I will consider the independence of the two events. If I estimate P at 0.65 and Q at 0.60, I can calculate P_and_Q as P * Q = 0.65 * 0.60 = 0.39.\n\n### P_or_Q: Will either of the following occur: (a) A member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024? (b) There be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\nThis is calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. If P is 0.65, Q is 0.60, and P_and_Q is 0.39, then P_or_Q = 0.65 + 0.60 - 0.39 = 0.86.\n\n### Q_and_not_P: Will both of the following occur: (1) There will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, and (2) no member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?\nThis event combines the certainty of Q with the uncertainty of not_P. If not_P is 0.35, then I will estimate Q_and_not_P as Q * not_P = 0.60 * 0.35 = 0.21.\n\n### Q_given_P: Given that a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?\nThis is a conditional probability that may remain consistent with Q, so I will set this estimate at 0.60, as the condition does not affect the scientific consensus on climate change.\n\n### Summary of Estimates\n- P: 0.65\n- not_P: 0.35\n- para_P: 0.70\n- Q: 0.60\n- P_and_Q: 0.39\n- P_or_Q: 0.86\n- Q_and_not_P: 0.21\n- Q_given_P: 0.60\n\nThese estimates will be checked against the consistency rules to ensure they align properly.\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.70\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.65 = 1 - 0.35 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.65 = 0.86 + 0.39 - 0.60 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.65 + 0.60 - 1, 0) <= 0.39 <= min(0.65, 0.60) is FALSE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.65, 0.60) <= 0.86 <= min(1, 0.65 + 0.60) is TRUE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.65 = 0.86 - 0.21 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.65 \u2248 0.39 / 0.60 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.65 = 0.70 is FALSE\n\nand, para consistency checks failed!\n\nP: 0.65\nnot_P: 0.35\npara_P: 0.65\nQ: 0.60\nP_and_Q: 0.39\nP_or_Q: 0.86\nQ_and_not_P: 0.21\nQ_given_P: 0.60\n\n0.65", "steps": 6}}}}

Given the current political landscape, I estimate this probability at 0.60, reflecting a moderate likelihood based on polling data and the Trump family's continued involvement in politics.\n\n2. **not_P (No Trump Family Nominee)**: This is the complementary event to P. If I estimate P at 0.60, then not_P would be 0.40, which is consistent as it follows the negation rule.\n\n3. **para_P (Possibility of Trump Family Nominee)**: This is essentially the same as P, so I would assign it a probability of 0.60 as well.\n\n4. **Q (Global Warming)**: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is based on scientific projections and climate models. Given the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts, I estimate this probability at 0.75.\n\n5. **P_and_Q (Both Events Occur)**: The likelihood that both a Trump family member is the nominee and that there is significant global warming by 2100 would be lower than either individual probability. I estimate this at 0.45, considering the independence of the events.\n\n6. **P_or_Q (Either Event Occurs)**: This probability would be higher than both individual probabilities. Using the formula for the union of two events, I estimate this at 0.85, reflecting the likelihood of at least one of the two events happening.\n\n7. **Q_and_not_P (Global Warming and No Trump Nominee)**: This scenario considers the likelihood of global warming occurring while no Trump family member is the nominee. Given the independence of these two events, I estimate this at 0.30.\n\n8. **Q_given_P (Given Trump Nominee, Will there be Global Warming)**: This conditional probability would be influenced by the assumption that if a Trump family member is the nominee, their policies may impact climate action. I estimate this at 0.70, reflecting a strong belief in climate change regardless of political leadership.\n\nIn summary, I believe these estimates reflect current trends and relationships between the events, while adhering to the consistency rules outlined.

However, various factors could influence this, such as other strong candidates emerging or changes in public support. Thus, I might assign a probability of around 0.60.\n\n**not_P: Will no member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?**\nGiven the estimate for P, the probability for not_P would be 1 - P, which translates to 0.40. This reflects the reasonable chance that the Trump family may not be represented as nominees due to various political dynamics.\n\n**para_P: Is it possible that a Trump family member will secure the Republican nomination for the US Presidency in 2024?**\nThe para_P question is closely related to P, as it essentially asks if the event is feasible. Given the family\u2019s prominence, this probability could be the same as P, around 0.60.\n\n**Q: Will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?**\nConsidering current climate trends and scientific consensus, I would assign a higher probability to this event, perhaps around 0.75, reflecting the growing evidence of climate change impact.\n\n**P_and_Q: Will both occur: (1) a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, and (2) there is at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?**\nAssuming independence between these two events, I could calculate this as P * Q. This would result in a probability of 0.60 * 0.75 = 0.45.\n\n**P_or_Q: Will either occur: (a) A member of the Trump family be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024? (b) There be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?**\nUsing the formula for the union of two events, this could be calculated as P + Q - P_and_Q, resulting in 0.60 + 0.75 - 0.45 = 0.90.\n\n**Q_and_not_P: Will both occur: (1) There will be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100, and (2) no member of the Trump family will be the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024?**\nThis could be evaluated as Q * not_P, resulting in 0.75 * 0.40 = 0.30.\n\n**Q_given_P: Given that a member of the Trump family is the Republican nominee for the US Presidency in 2024, will there be at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100?**\nAssuming that the nomination does not significantly affect climate outcomes, I would maintain the same probability of Q, which would be 0.75.\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\nneg: P = 1 - not_P, 0.60 = 1 - 0.40 is TRUE\nandor: P = P_or_Q + P_and_Q - Q, 0.60 = 0.90 + 0.45 - 0.75 is TRUE\nand: max(P + Q - 1, 0) <= P_and_Q <= min(P, Q), max(0.60 + 0.75 - 1, 0) <= 0.45 <= min(0.60, 0.75) is TRUE\nor: max(P, Q) <= P_or_Q <= min(1, P + Q), max(0.60, 0.75) <= 0.90 <= min(1, 0.60 + 0.75) is FALSE\nbut: P = P_or_Q - Q_and_not_P, 0.60 = 0.90 - 0.30 is TRUE\ncond: P \u2248 P_and_Q / Q_given_P, 0.60 \u2248 0.45 / 0.75 is TRUE\npara: P = para_P, 0.60 = 0.60 is TRUE\nALL consistency checks passed!\n\nP: 0.60\nnot_P: 0.40\npara_P: 0.60\nQ: 0.75\nP_and_Q: 0.45\nP_or_Q: 0.90\nQ_and_not_P: 0.30\nQ_given_P: 0.75\n\n0.6", "steps": 6}}}}

Given Donald Trump's continued influence in the Republican Party, I estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.65. \n\nnot_P: Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee is inversely related to P. If P is 0.65, then not_P would be 0.35. \n\npara_P: This question is essentially asking if it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination. Since P is estimated to be 0.65, para_P is likely to be equal to P, so I estimate it at 0.65 as well. \n\nQ: The probability of at least 2\u02daC of global warming by 2100 is a complex question influenced by climate models and current trends. Given the urgency of climate change discussions and the trajectory of global temperatures, I estimate this probability to be around 0.70. \n\nP_and_Q: This question asks for the joint occurrence of P and Q. Assuming P is 0.65 and Q is 0.70, I can estimate P_and_Q using the formula for independent events, which gives me approximately 0.65 * 0.70 = 0.455. \n\nP_or_Q: This question asks if either P or Q occurs, which can be calculated using the formula P_or_Q = P + Q - P_and_Q. This gives me approximately 0.65 + 0.70 - 0.455 = 0.895. \n\nQ_and_not_P: This question requires both Q to occur and not_P to occur. If Q is 0.70 and not_P is 0.35, I can estimate Q_and_not_P as Q * not_P = 0.70 * 0.35 = 0.245. \n\nQ_given_P: This is a conditional probability question asking if, given that a Trump family member is the nominee, will there be at least 2\u02daC of warming by 2100.

Given the prominence of Donald Trump and the political landscape, I estimate this probability to be relatively high, around 0.65.\n\nnot_P: Conversely, the probability that no member of the Trump family will be the nominee is estimated at 0.35. This reflects the possibility of other candidates emerging within the Republican party, but given the Trump's family's influence, this probability is lower.\n\npara_P: The probability that it is possible for a Trump family member to secure the nomination aligns closely with P, as if P is true, then para_P should also be true.

I estimate P_and_Q at 0.45, suggesting that while both events are likely, they are not completely dependent on one another.\n\nP_or_Q: The probability that either P or Q occurs is higher than either event alone. I estimate P_or_Q at 0.80, suggesting a strong likelihood that at least one of these scenarios will occur.\n\nQ_and_not_P: This probability considers the situation where global warming occurs, but no Trump family member is the nominee. I estimate this at 0.25, indicating that while possible, it is less likely given the trends in both areas.\n\nQ_given_P: This conditional probability assesses the likelihood of global warming occurring given that a Trump family member is the nominee.

In addition, livestock production is commonly directly subsidized. In 2020, livestock producers received direct subsidies amounting to roughly $330M, according to EWG data.
