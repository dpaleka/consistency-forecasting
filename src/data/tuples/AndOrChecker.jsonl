Proponents of the ban argue that previous efforts have not prevented states such as North Korea from pursuing nuclear programs, and that disarmament, rather than deterrence, is the best way to prevent nuclear war.\nIt's not unprecedented for states to completely disarm, however.

But could we devise some strange substance that has the property, using something like the Casimir effect, that takes empty space and removes some energy from it? It sees plausible that negative energy is closely related to violations of the second law of thermodynamics, which would mean that it is very, very hard to violate. But maybe not impossible. \"Violations\" of the second law (downward movements in entropy) can happen if you wait long enough, or if you set up very, very careful initial conditions (see, e.g. here) So it does not seem impossible that with a high level of tuning a sample of negative energy could be made, though the author is not at all clear how...\nSo instead we ask:\nWill a sample of negative energy material be created by the year 2100?\nTo be specific, we'll ask whether > 10 proton masses worth of negative energy will be created and confined to a volume of less than 1 cubic centimeter for longer than 1 microsecond, in such a way that during that microsecond there exists a volume of space that could be considered to have a mass of less than -10 proton masses. (As of 2017, the record for antimatter, an altogether easier substance to make, was about 300 proton masses.)\n","resolution_date":"2100-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"metaculus","url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/600","metadata":{"topics":[{"id":128,"slug":"physics","name":"Physics","link_id":13195,"num_questions":402},{"id":36,"slug":"philosophy","name":"Philosophy","link_id":13202,"num_questions":133},{"id":135,"slug":"quantum-mechanics","name":"Quantum mechanics","link_id":13197,"num_questions":55},{"id":1766,"slug":"cosmology","name":"Cosmology","link_id":40968,"num_questions":34},{"id":134,"slug":"particle-physics","name":"Particle physics","link_id":13196,"num_questions":28},{"id":607,"slug":"science","name":"Science","link_id":13199,"num_questions":24},{"id":2514,"slug":"science-fiction","name":"Science fiction","link_id":44102,"num_questions":23},{"id":4738,"slug":"thermodynamics","name":"Thermodynamics","link_id":50043,"num_questions":13}],"background_info":""},"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"2537ccfa-5276-487a-8f09-74b6a17fce80","title":"Will there be a complete 4 year interval in which world output doubles, before the first 1 year interval in which world output doubles?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nResolution is by credible assessment of world GDP in constant US dollars (or other appropriately widely-accepted units).\nThere will be an ambiguous resolution if there is no 4 year (nor 1 year) doubling interval by 2050, to isolate specifically the takeoff speed from other things like the chances of no takeoff occurring at all or human extinction\n","resolution_date":"2100-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"metaculus","url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/736","metadata":{"topics":[{"id":858,"slug":"ethics","name":"Ethics","link_id":7251,"num_questions":102},{"id":2326,"slug":"paul-christiano","name":"Paul Christiano","link_id":43322,"num_questions":13}],"background_info":"Related Questions on Metaculus:\nWill a 8-year GWP doubling complete before a 2-year doubling does?\nWill there be a 4 year interval in which world output doubles before 2050?\nAs of 2018, it's taken about 16 years for the world economic output to double. So it might seem absurd to talk about it doubling in one or even four years. But there is a potential major change on the horizon: very advanced Artificial Intelligence.\nAn important consideration in how to approach the AI alignment problem is the speed of the takeoff from massively subhuman AI to massively superhuman AI. The effectiveness of capacity limitation, as well as the existence of fire alarms for AI safety, are heavily dependent on this, for example.\nPaul Christiano suggests operationalising the takeoff speed in terms of economic growth. A slow takeoff is one where the economy doubles in four years before the first time it doubles in one year, and a fast takeoff is one where it does not. (See the same article for Christiano's list of arguments regarding fast vs. slow takeoff.)\n"},"resolution":null}}}}
