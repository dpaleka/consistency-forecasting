The definition of 'functional' means that the quantum computer can reliably manipulate and measure qubits without significant errors that would undermine its performance.","resolution_date":"2028-12-31T00:00:00","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic","created_date":null,"url":null,"metadata":{"source_question":"Will India become a global leader in quantum computing by 2030?"},"resolution":null}},"relevance":{"reasons":["Collaboration on major quantum computing projects could directly impact the technological capabilities and resources available to India, potentially accelerating the development of functional quantum computers.","The success of a collaborative project could lead to advancements in research and development that might enable India to achieve the milestone of producing a functional quantum computer with over 100 qubits.","Both questions are related to India's progress in the field of quantum computing, making it logical to consider their interdependence."],"conclusion":"It makes sense to consider the logical combination of these questions as they are related to India's advancements in quantum computing and could influence each other.","score":8.0}}}
