Should the EEA or the designated authoritative body fail to provide a conclusive report by the resolution date, the question will resolve using the most recent official data available prior to January 1, 2031.\n\n2. By January 1, 2050, a peer-reviewed scientific publication confirms the creation and identification of an isotope that is part of the theorized island of stability in the periodic table of elements. The isotope must exhibit a half-life of at least one minute, which is significantly longer than the half-lives of surrounding elements that are not considered stable. The publication must be recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) or an equivalent authoritative body in the field of chemistry or nuclear physics. In the event that the IUPAC or its equivalent is no longer operational or recognized as an authoritative body, a consensus among at least five leading experts in the field, from at least three different countries, will be required to confirm the discovery. If no such isotope is confirmed by the resolution date, the question will resolve as No.\n\n3. Before January 1, 2025, there is a verifiable report of an individual holding their breath for more than 30 consecutive minutes under the following conditions:\n\n- The individual must be submerged in water or in a controlled environment that simulates submersion, without the use of any breathing apparatus or external oxygen supply.\n\n- The attempt must be continuously monitored and recorded by an independent organization recognized for certifying breath-holding records, such as the Guinness World Records or AIDA International (Association for the Development of Apnea).\n\n- The individual must be conscious and alert throughout the duration of the attempt, and medical professionals must confirm the individual's well-being immediately following the attempt.\n\n- The use of any performance-enhancing drugs or medical procedures specifically aimed at increasing breath-holding capacity is not permitted.\n\n- In the event of a tie, where multiple individuals meet the criteria on the same day, the question will resolve as Yes for each individual.\n\n- If no verifiable report is presented by the resolution date, the question will resolve as No.\n\nThe question will resolve as NO if any of the above conditions is not met.","resolution_date":"2050-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"metadata":{"base_sentences":{"P":{"id":"7afd84db-3952-4be1-84f5-8753acc3d0fa","title":"Will the European Union meet its 2030 targets under the Paris Climate Treaty?","body":"The European Union's 2030 targets under the Paris Climate Treaty are defined by the following key objectives: \n\n- A 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions (from 1990 levels)\n- At least 32% share for renewable energy\n- At least 32.5% improvement in energy efficiency\n\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the European Union officially reports achieving all of the above targets by December 31, 2030, as confirmed by the European Environment Agency (EEA) or another authoritative body designated for this purpose. \n\nIn the event that the European Union redefines its targets under the Paris Climate Treaty before the resolution date, the revised targets will be used to determine the outcome of this question. \n\nIf the European Union dissolves or any member state exits the Union before the resolution date, the question will resolve as No, unless the exiting member state(s) individually meet the targets and their data is included in the overall EU report. \n\nShould the EEA or the designated authoritative body fail to provide a conclusive report by the resolution date, the question will resolve using the most recent official data available prior to January 1, 2031.","resolution_date":"2031-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"metaculus","url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/489","metadata":{"topics":[{"id":141,"slug":"united-states","name":"United States","link_id":16453,"num_questions":1799},{"id":311,"slug":"european-union","name":"European Union","link_id":16454,"num_questions":250},{"id":1167,"slug":"paris-agreement","name":"Paris Agreement","link_id":36639,"num_questions":28},{"id":1813,"slug":"paris","name":"Paris","link_id":36640,"num_questions":8}]},"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"ed3cc8ec-a17d-4429-8712-c9c9558cc1f9","title":"Will we reach the island of stability by 2050?","body":"The question will resolve as Yes if, by January 1, 2050, a peer-reviewed scientific publication confirms the creation and identification of an isotope that is part of the theorized island of stability in the periodic table of elements.
