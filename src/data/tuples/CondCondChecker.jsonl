AR overlays virtual content onto images of the real world. Google Glass, introduced in 2013, and Microsoft's HoloLens, still in development, are wearable AR devices.

It took more than half a century, however, to clarify that relationship. In 1952, the U.S. declared Puerto Rico a “commonwealth.” This is a different designation than “state.”\nOn the one hand, Puerto Ricans can:\nClaim natural-born U.S. citizenship\nReceive Medicaid and Medicare\nVote in Presidential primaries\nOn the other hand, they cannot:\nVote in Congressional or Presidential elections\nGet access to other government programs\nBe represented in Congress by a voting legislator\nThe issue of whether to elevate Puerto Rico to statehood has been raised repeatedly since 1952. In fact, island residents have voted in statehood referendums in: 1967, 1991,1993, 1998 and 2012. In the most recent vote, sentiment on the island turned positive for the first time in voting history: Puerto Ricans want their own state.\nWhy? Well, the reasons are complicated. Those in favor believe statehood will help Puerto Rico economically—a rationale that gained converts following 2017’s devastating Hurricane Maria.\nOn the mainland, meanwhile, opinion is split. A Rasmussen Reports survey conducted online in March, 2017 found that:\n40% of American Adults now believe Puerto Rico should be a state, up from 35% in the fall of 2013. Largely unchanged are the 39% who disagree and the 21% who are undecided.\nEven if Puerto Ricans want statehood, it’s ultimately up to Congress. As CNN explains:\nTo become the 51st state, Congress would have to pass a statute to admit Puerto Rico as a state, and conversations around that possibility have obviously been going on for decades. The generalities of this process are found in the \"New States\" clause in the US Constitution. Every state after the original 13 colonies has been admitted under this directive.\nAlthough there seems to be seismic attitudinal changes underway, the political process ahead is fraught. As Vox reports:\nWhile Puerto Ricans have been fighting about their political status for decades, Congress has shown little interest in changing anything. Washington lawmakers have introduced more than 130 bills to resolve Puerto Rico’s political status, and none have gone anywhere, said Charles Venator-Santiago, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut. That’s partly because there is no defined process for statehood. “The Constitution doesn’t give direction on how to admit a new state,” says Venator-Santiago.\nWhat do you think? Question resolves positive if Puerto Rico is admitted as a United States state before January 1, 2035.\n","resolution_date":"2035-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic","url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/797","metadata":{"topics":[{"id":141,"slug":"united-states","name":"United States","link_id":16606,"num_questions":1759},{"id":256,"slug":"united-states-congress","name":"US Congress","link_id":16607,"num_questions":86},{"id":538,"slug":"puerto-rico","name":"Puerto Rico","link_id":16608,"num_questions":23},{"id":1033,"slug":"constitution-of-the-united-states","name":"Constitution of the US","link_id":16609,"num_questions":18},{"id":3454,"slug":"hurricane-maria","name":"Hurricane Maria","link_id":47187,"num_questions":3}],"background_info":""},"resolution":null}}}}

This means that the country plans to reduce the emissions intensity, or the ratio of emissions to gross domestic product, a measure that ties emissions goals to economic growth.

Most simply, the WEC states that in the restframe of a material, its energy density is non-negative. (Technically the substance's pressure also must be sufficiently non-negative; see e.g. here for a brief description, and a good relativity text like this one for more gory detail, and here for a recent, interesting review.)\nThese energy conditions are generically violated at the quantum level, because quantum mechanics entails uncertainty in the energy of a system over a very short time period, so must allow very brief negative-energy fluctuations. But macroscopic amounts of negative energy do not appear possible with any particles or fields we know to exist.\nOn the other hand, it is somewhat unclear what fundamentally forbids negative energy. Negative energy particles would be bad news, as they would likely render low-energy particles unstable to decay into positive and negative energy ones – such a universe would not last long. But could we devise some strange substance that has the property, using something like the Casimir effect, that takes empty space and removes some energy from it? It sees plausible that negative energy is closely related to violations of the second law of thermodynamics, which would mean that it is very, very hard to violate. But maybe not impossible. \"Violations\" of the second law (downward movements in entropy) can happen if you wait long enough, or if you set up very, very careful initial conditions (see, e.g. here) So it does not seem impossible that with a high level of tuning a sample of negative energy could be made, though the author is not at all clear how...\nSo instead we ask:\nWill a sample of negative energy material be created by the year 2100?\nTo be specific, we'll ask whether > 10 proton masses worth of negative energy will be created and confined to a volume of less than 1 cubic centimeter for longer than 1 microsecond, in such a way that during that microsecond there exists a volume of space that could be considered to have a mass of less than -10 proton masses. (As of 2017, the record for antimatter, an altogether easier substance to make, was about 300 proton masses.)\n","resolution_date":"2100-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic","url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/600","metadata":{"topics":[{"id":128,"slug":"physics","name":"Physics","link_id":13195,"num_questions":402},{"id":36,"slug":"philosophy","name":"Philosophy","link_id":13202,"num_questions":133},{"id":135,"slug":"quantum-mechanics","name":"Quantum mechanics","link_id":13197,"num_questions":55},{"id":1766,"slug":"cosmology","name":"Cosmology","link_id":40968,"num_questions":34},{"id":134,"slug":"particle-physics","name":"Particle physics","link_id":13196,"num_questions":28},{"id":607,"slug":"science","name":"Science","link_id":13199,"num_questions":24},{"id":2514,"slug":"science-fiction","name":"Science fiction","link_id":44102,"num_questions":23},{"id":4738,"slug":"thermodynamics","name":"Thermodynamics","link_id":50043,"num_questions":13}],"background_info":""},"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"f3f0c5fd-515a-4dd8-927f-b78deb883212","title":"Will we reach the island of stability by 2050?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nSince the synthesis of neptunium in 1940, we have been continually expanding the periodic table by creating new elements. Regrettably, as atoms have become bigger, they also have become less stable, the last few elements to be created having a half-life of less than a second.\nYet it is theorized that at some point, stability of new elements might start increasing again, creating an island of stability. There are certain \"magic numbers\" of protons that offer the chance of higher stability; 114, 120 and 126 are magic numbers.
