China's goal was to reduce emissions by 60-65% per unit GDP by 2030. This means that the country plans to reduce the emissions intensity, or the ratio of emissions to gross domestic product, a measure that ties emissions goals to economic growth. If achieved, by 2030 China will emit around 13-14 gigatons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases per year, whereas today the country accounts for 10.6 gigatons per year, or 29.5% of the global total. Current projections estimate that China will better than meet its goal, with 2030 emissions around 12-14 gigatons per year.\nAnalysts say that China's goal is achievable, thanks to a decrease in coal use in the country.
