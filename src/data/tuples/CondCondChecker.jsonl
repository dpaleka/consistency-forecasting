Indium is threatened too, says Armin Reller, a materials chemist at Germany‚Äôs University of Augsburg. He estimates that our planet‚Äôs stock of indium will last no more than another decade. All the hafnium will be gone by 2017 also, and another twenty years will see the extinction of zinc. Even copper is an endangered item, since worldwide demand for it is likely to exceed available supplies by the end of the present century.\n\nResolution Criteria for the second part:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the following conditions are met before January 1, 2040:\n- A digital system successfully emulates the human brain with a level of intelligence comparable to that of an average human, as confirmed by a panel of neuroscientists and AI experts.\n- The emulation demonstrates capabilities such as learning, memory, reasoning, and creativity at a level equivalent to or surpassing human performance in a variety of tasks.\n- The emulation is capable of passing a series of standardized cognitive tests designed to evaluate human-level intelligence.\n- The achievement is widely recognized and accepted by the scientific community and leading experts in the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe resolution will not consider partial or incomplete emulations that do not meet the specified criteria, and the emulation must demonstrate sustained performance over an extended period to be considered successful.\n\nResolution Criteria for the third part:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the State of Israel is formally recognized by the government of Iran at any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2070.\n\nThe question resolves YES if all three parts are met, and NO otherwise.","resolution_date":"2070-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"metadata":{"base_sentences":{"P":{"id":"93b240c3-12ef-430d-ba55-13630eba9112","title":"Will humanity (essentially) run out of at least one element currently considered \"under serious threat\" by 2040?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nIn 2008, science fiction author, Robert Silverberg, penned a provocative web essay, The Death of Galium, that predicted that we would collectively run out of several essential, rare elements within a single decade.
