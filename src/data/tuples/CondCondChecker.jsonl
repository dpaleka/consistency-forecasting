One astute twitter follower noted that given the number of Starships and frequency of launches he's planning, we can infer the size of the Martian population for which he's planning: 1 million by 2050. Musk summarily affirmed that estimate.\nLike most of Musk's predictions, this timeline seems too ambitious to be realized. Corrected to Musk Years, a million-Martian population is more likely to exist by spring of 2074. My question is simple: Will it? More specifically, Will the population of living, biological humans residing on Mars be greater than or equal to one million before 2075-01-01?\nSome specifics:\nHumans born on Mars or born en route to Mars (if that's even possible within the prediction window) do count towards the total (though it seems unlikely this is a major source of population growth in Musk's model).\nHumans who die on Mars or en route to Mars prior to the closing date do not count towards the total.\nHumans who leave Mars do not count towards the total, unless they return to Mars prior to the resolution date.\nThis should be resolved according to a credible estimate by any institution suited to evaluate the population sizes of Martian colonies.
