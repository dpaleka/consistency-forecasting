Credible industry reports will be required for resolution.\nFor the purposes of this question, an \"augmented reality headset\" is defined as a device which is portable and worn over the user's head, and whose primary use is in augmented reality functions. \"Augmented reality functions\" are defined as recognizing and interpreting objects in the user's real environment, and producing digital information and images overlaid over the user's view of their real environment, which update in real time as the user moves and interacts with the digital and physical environment.\nFor the purposes of this question, a \"virtual reality headset\" is defined as a device which is portable and worn over the user's head, and whose primary use is in virtual reality functions. \"virtual reality functions\" are defined as mostly or entirely covering the user's field of view, and tracking the user's viewpoint in 6 degrees of freedom, which the user can interact with through movement, voice, or other controls.\nIn the case that a device is capable of both AR and VR functionality, it will be considered an AR device only in the calculation of resolution. Devices such as smartphones in 2021, whose primary functions are not intended as AR or VR, do not qualify for the purposes of this question\n","resolution_date":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"Q_given_P":{"id":"02a05076-105c-4aa5-809c-8b647465dceb","title":"Given that by 2025 there are more VR headset sales than AR headset sales, will someone be able to hold his/her breath for 30+ minutes by the same year?","body":"Resolves N/A if the condition about VR and AR headset sales is not met in 2025.
