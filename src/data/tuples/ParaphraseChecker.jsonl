The EU's goal was to reduce emissions by 40% below 1990 levels. If achieved, by 2030 the EU will emit around 3.4-3.9 gigatons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases per year, whereas today the region accounts for 3.46 gigatons per year, or nearly ten percent of the global total. Emissions have been in decline since 1990. Current projections estimate that the EU goals represent a slowdown in the region's trend of emission reduction and that the slowdown is not be enough to limit global temperature rise to only 1.5 or even 2 degrees C.\nOther goals of the EU's by 2030:\nAt least 27% of total energy consumption from renewable energy\nAt least 27% increase in energy efficiency\n"},"resolution":null}}}}
