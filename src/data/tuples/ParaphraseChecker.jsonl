There are two types of lithium, the hardrock (spodumene), and the lithium brines in desert regions which when evaporated gradually leave lithium behind. Lithium is a key part of the current battery technology needed to produce electric vehicles, and as EV demand grows, so does the need for minable lithium. The expected demand for lithium is expected to rise to 159.6 kilotonnes by 2030 for light vehicles. In 2019, our current lithium supply was only 77 kilotonnes.\nChile and Argentina have already seen large increases in demand for lithium, with increased production to match it. Bolivia, which is still in its early days with lithium mining, has yet to enter the world market as a large-scale producer. In 2019, Chile provided 18,000 tonnes of lithium to market and Argentina behind that with 6,400.\nThe U.S geographical survey estimates that Bolivia has over 9 million tonnes of identifiable lithium resources in its salt flats. So far, Bolivia has been producing 400 tonnes of lithium in a private test site, which now should be able to scale quickly due to the change in political leadership.\nAustralia, which currently holds the record in annual lithium production at 42,000 tonnes in 2019, has a total estimated lithium reserve of 2,800,000 tonnes, almost ⅓ of the reserves in Chile, and less than twice as much as Argentina. As Bolivia enters the market, the dynamics of production and price could change dramatically.\nThe number of exports and interest in the lithium triangle could dramatically increase as the prices of lithium fall. High labor costs and protected union jobs, with an average yearly salary of 62,636 US Dollars in Australia, make production an expensive affair. In 2019, lithium demand fell 19%, bringing prices down with it.\n\"Several established lithium operations postponed capacity expansion plans. Junior mining operations in Australia ceased production altogether.\"\nLow prices in lithium aren't necessarily daunting to South American producers, for whom labor costs are extremely low at approximately 6,148 US dollars a year in Argentina in mining positions, and an average 12,726 US dollars a year in Chile. With lower transport costs to the United States as well, this might become a more attractive option than Australia in the future, both for consumers and producers.\nLUT-Augsburg researchers attempting to model the amount of lithium left, to understand demand and production dynamics, found with increasing uncertainty that there could be anywhere from 30-95 million tonnes of lithium reserves left.\n\"The researchers modeled four lithium supply scenarios based on the estimates. In their worst-case forecast, no additional lithium resources will be discovered. That would leave humanity 26 Mt of lithium. If the policies ( recycling, V2G, second-life) and only 3 billion electric vehicles on the road were matched with just 26 Mt of lithium, but recycling efforts would only grow slowly, battery manufacturers will close shops even before 2040.\"\nIn this scenario, with only 2.8 million tonnes of lithium reserves, Australian production would drop off more quickly than that of the lithium triangle.\n"},"resolution":null}}}}
