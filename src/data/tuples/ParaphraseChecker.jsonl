This solution is to allow computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each concept deÔ¨Åned through its relation to simpler concepts. By gathering knowledge from experience, this approach avoids the need for human operators to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts enables the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones.
