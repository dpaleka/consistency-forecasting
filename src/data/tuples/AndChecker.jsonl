As of the writing of this question, Tesla is losing money and selling significantly less cars than even the 20th largest auto-company in the world. Yet, the expectations that have been set for Tesla by Elon Musk would probably require Tesla to sell more cars than any other company on the planet while maintaining large profit-margins.\nIn order to ramp-up production from approx. 100,000 to 500,000 or 1,000,000 cars a year, Tesla has created the Model 3, its first mass market car. Regrettably, Tesla has had trouble producing the Model 3 and production of the car can be tracked here. It is likely that Tesla's total vehicle production must exceed 10 million in order for it to become the world's largest car company. Yet, given its financial situation, there is a risk that the company goes bankrupt before that happens."},"resolution":null}},"relevance":{"reasons":["Political and economic landscapes are often intertwined. If Tucker Carlson, a prominent media personality with strong opinions on various economic policies, becomes the Republican nominee and potentially the President, his policies could significantly impact the automotive industry, including companies like Tesla.","Carlson's stance on environmental regulations, trade policies, and subsidies for electric vehicles could either benefit or hinder Tesla's growth, making the logical combination of these questions relevant for those interested in the intersection of politics and economics."],"conclusion":"The logical combination of these questions is relevant and could provide valuable insights into the potential future of both US politics and the automotive industry.","score":7.0}}}
