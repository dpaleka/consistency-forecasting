AndChecker 
"Q:" question is incorrect, it just repeats P, "P_and_Q" looks fine though
Questions look fine though

AndOrChecker
looks fine, but why do we have And, Or, and AndOr?  It just seems repeated.

ButChecker
Missing "Q" question tuple
question quality still good

CondChecker
Missing "Q"

CondCondChecker
Missing Q and R tuples
P_and_Q_and_R:  The questions generally are missing "R", some also missing "Q".  Generally for these only two of the questions are ANDed and the third is missing.

NegChecker
Some of the questions are inverting properties of the "body" as opposed to just the title
{"P":{"id":"25f6ca4b-33d8-4bfc-b893-0862c163ebce","title":"Will we reach the island of stability by 2050?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nSince the synthesis of neptunium in 1940, we have been continually expanding the periodic table by creating new elements. Regrettably, as atoms have become bigger, they also have become less stable, the last few elements to be created having a half-life of less than a second.\nYet it is theorized that at some point, stability of new elements might start increasing again, creating an island of stability. There are certain \"magic numbers\" of protons that offer the chance of higher stability; 114, 120 and 126 are magic numbers. We have yet to reach elements 120 and 126 and there might still be more stable isotopes of element 114 that have not yet been created.\nIt is asked:\nWill we create an isotope of an element that has more than 110 protons, that has a half-life of at least one day (86,400 seconds) prior to 2050?\nIn order for the question to resolve positive the half-life of the isotope must be verified by an independent scientific team to be greater than one day prior to 2050.\n","resolution_date":"2050-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"not_P":{"id":"503be751-35fa-4125-869f-24b65303c155","title":"Will we not create an isotope of an element that has more than 110 protons, that has a half-life of at least one day (86,400 seconds) prior to 2050?","body

SymmetryAndChecker
These look mostly good

ParaphraseChecker
These look pretty good too, good use of using the body to rephrase questions

SymmetryOrChecker
Looks good

Question quality should be much better

CondChecker:
We are still missing the "Q" tuple

condcondchecker
also missing "Q" tuple
also missing "R" tuple

Conseqchecker:
still a bit finnicky, Q not necessarilly are subset of P resolutions

Everything looks a lot better
upgraded to gpt-4-turbo
One thing to note is that gpt-4 adds A LOT of extra meta-data and detail from the original question (which gpt-3 for some reason dropped).


Conseqchecker:
added examples
questions a lot higher quality
However, there's a random 'Q' tuple here that's pretty irrelavent to the questions.  I am assuming this is some copy over mistake when adding back the metadata for the other ones.

Amazing details on Blaine’s feat are available in this TED Talk\nAll very nice. But bioengineering will allow us to push the record up—possibily, way up. Some techniques, like “lung packing,” are already being put to use by daredevils. Per Deadspin:\nThis [lung packing] consists of inhaling the very largest breath possible, and then, without exhaling, puffing your cheeks full of more air and attempting to force that air down into your lungs. You are literally stretching out your lungs so that they can hold more air.\nMore exotic ideas, like the so-called “Aquaman Crystal” are promising.\nSome extreme atheletes and freedivers are no doubt experimenting and pushing the limits.\nAnd there are documented cases on the record of people surviving without oxygen for long periods of time. As the BBC reports:\nWhen US toddler Michelle Funk fell into an icy stream in 1986, she survived an estimated 66 minutes underwater, preserved by deep hypothermia that reduced her metabolic rate to almost nothing.\nFunk’s case was a freak accident. But by 2025 will a person voluntarily hold his or her breath for more than 30 minutes?
