The ban targets six categories of single-use plastics: checkout bags, cutlery, foodservice ware made from or containing problematic plastics, ring carriers, stir sticks, and straws.\n\n    2. **Current Status**: The ban on the manufacture and import of these items began on December 20, 2022, with the sale of these items prohibited starting December 20, 2023. The export of these items is slated to be banned by December 20, 2025.\n\n    3. **Legal Challenges**: There was a legal challenge to the ban, with the Federal Court ruling in favor of the industry, stating that the broad definition of \"toxic\" plastics was unreasonable and unconstitutional. However, the Federal Court of Appeal granted a stay, allowing the ban to remain in effect while the government's appeal is ongoing.\n\n    4. **Recent Developments**: As of the latest updates in April 2024, the ban remains in place due to the stay granted by the Federal Court of Appeal. This means that the single-use plastics ban is currently enforced and has not been officially reversed.\n\n    Given this information, it is clear that as of the current date (June 30, 2024), Canada's ban on single-use plastics remains in effect. Since there is no indication of an immediate reversal before August 2024, and considering the legal process is ongoing, we can conclude that the ban will likely continue through August 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":true}},"resolution":true}}}}

However, this question specifically asks about the enrollment in the current program, not a hypothetical full expansion.\n\n    Given these points, it is clear that the Georgia Pathways program did not enroll over 300,000 people by July 2024.

However, the search results indicate a Steven Parker in Volusia County, Florida, who was involved in contractor fraud, not procurement fraud. This discrepancy suggests the question might not be well-formed or accurate regarding the specific case.\n    2. **Additional Charges**: Despite the potential mismatch in the case type, we can still examine if a Steven Parker faced additional charges. According to the sources, Steven Parker in Volusia County was indeed charged with additional criminal counts related to contractor fraud and exploitation of an elderly veteran. These charges were reported in March 2024, which is before the resolution date of July 31, 2024.\n    3. **Relevance and Specificity**: The question's details specify that the new charges must be distinct from and in addition to the original counts. The sources confirm that Parker faced new charges for exploiting a 97-year-old veteran and for contractor fraud in additional cases, which are distinct from the initial charges.\n    4. **Conclusion**: Given the information available, it appears that a Steven Parker did face additional criminal charges by July 2024. However, due to the potential mismatch in the case type (procurement fraud vs. contractor fraud), there is a slight ambiguity. Despite this, the core of the question regarding additional charges seems to be resolved affirmatively based on the available data.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":true}},"resolution":true}}}}

For FY 2024, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $6.72 billion for the FDA. For FY 2025, the proposed budget in the House is $6.8 billion, and in the Senate, it's an increase to a level that would be funded at $27.049 billion for the combined USDA and FDA budget, with a specific increase for the FDA.\n\n    2. **Required Increase**: A 20% increase over the FY 2024 budget of $6.72 billion would require an increase of $1.344 billion, making the new budget at least $8.064 billion.\n\n    3. **Senate Actions**: The Senate Appropriations Committee has advanced a bill for FY 2025 that includes an increase for the FDA, but the specifics of the increase are not detailed enough to confirm if it exceeds 20%.

The specific increase mentioned ($22 million) is significantly less than the required 20% increase.\n\n    Given this analysis, the question can be resolved as NO because the proposed increase does not meet the 20% threshold.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

The page provides information on how to check for recall campaigns but does not specify any large-scale recalls related to door latches.\n\n    2. **Reputable News Sources**: There are no reports from reputable news sources indicating a recall of over 720,000 Peugeot vehicles due to a door latch issue. While there are reports of recalls and investigations into other vehicle models for similar issues, there is no specific information about Peugeot initiating such a large recall for this reason.\n\n    3. **Other Relevant Information**: The Peugeot forums mention issues with door latches not grabbing properly, but these are individual reports and not indicative of a large-scale recall. The recall mentioned on Reddit pertains to electric and hybrid versions of the Peugeot 3008 III due to teething problems, not specifically a door latch issue.\n\n    Given the lack of information about a recall of this nature and scale by Peugeot, and considering that the resolution date has passed, we can conclude that Peugeot did not initiate a recall of over 720,000 vehicles due to a door latch issue by August 2024.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

This suggests that the integration of Cruise's robotaxis into Uber's service is planned but not for 2024.\n\n    2. **Current Operations**: Cruise has resumed operations in a few U.S. cities (Phoenix, Houston, and Dallas) and is conducting ongoing testing in Dubai. However, there is no mention of these services being available on Uber's platform in the Middle East by August 2024.\n\n    3. **Launch Timeline**: All sources indicate that the partnership will start in 2025, with no specific mention of an earlier launch in the Middle East by August 2024.\n\n    Based on this information, it is clear that Cruise's robotaxis are not planned to be available on Uber's ride-hailing service in the Middle East by August 2024.

The scholarships are competitive and based on academic achievement, leadership, and community service.\n    2. **Princeton University Funding**: Princeton University and its Department of Economics offer various funding opportunities for students, including research funding for Junior Independent Work and senior thesis projects, as well as support for economics-related unpaid summer internships and participation in economics competitions and conferences.\n    3. **Coca-Cola's Funding Scope**: There is no information indicating that Coca-Cola funds full tuition for all Princeton economics students.

However, it's crucial to note that the exact organization name in the question (\"National Teachers Association\") does not match the one found in the sources (\"National Education Association\").\n\n    Despite this discrepancy, considering the context and the information available, it is reasonable to conclude that the question is referring to the NEA event. Therefore, based on the cancellation of President Biden's speech at the NEA convention due to the strike, the question can be resolved.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

According to the Maryland Department of Health's announcement on July 11, 2024, the Medicaid enrollment stood at 1,684,462 as of May 31, 2024, which is after the pandemic-related automatic enrollments were re-evaluated.\n    2. **Pre-Pandemic Enrollment**: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the enrollment was 1,415,631.

For instance, the Commander of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) Admiral Fahd Al-Ghufaili visited Paris and met with the Chief of Staff of the French Navy Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, discussing various defense projects and technologies, including submarines. Additionally, Saudi Arabia and France signed an executive plan for cooperation on capabilities, military industries, and R&D, indicating a deepening of their defense ties. 2. **Economic and Energy Cooperation**: France has been engaging in talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to diversify Europe's energy supplies, aiming to reduce dependence on Russian energy sources. This indicates a new area of cooperation focused on energy security. 3. **Industrial and Technological Collaboration**: The participation of Saudi Arabia in the Eurosatory 2024 defense exhibition in Paris, where the Saudi pavilion showcased the kingdom's military industries and invited global investors, highlights efforts to enhance industrial and technological collaboration between the two countries. Given these developments, it is clear that France and Saudi Arabia have indeed implemented new forms of cooperation, particularly in defense and energy sectors, by July 2024.

However, the Spring Budget 2024 announced additional funding for the NHS, including £2.45 billion of day-to-day funding for 2024/25 and £3.4 billion for long-term capital investment over three years starting from 2025/26.\n\n    2. **Protests**: There is no direct evidence in the provided sources of large protests specifically in response to healthcare funding cuts by July 2024. While there have been industrial actions by NHS staff, including strikes by junior doctors and concerns over pay and patient safety, these actions are not described as large protests in response to funding cuts.\n\n    3. **Pharmacy Funding**: There have been issues with pharmacy funding, leading to potential actions such as pharmacies reducing their operating hours due to budget cuts. However, these actions are not described as large protests but rather as operational adjustments or potential industrial action by pharmacists.\n\n    Given the information available, there is no clear evidence of large protests in the United Kingdom in response to healthcare funding cuts by July 2024 that meet the specified criteria. However, the question's resolution criteria are very specific, requiring credible reports from at least two major international news outlets of protests involving at least 1,000 participants. Without direct evidence of such protests, the question cannot be definitively resolved as YES. However, the lack of evidence up to the resolution date suggests that the criteria for a YES resolution have not been met.\n\n    Since the resolution date has passed and no evidence of large protests meeting the specified criteria has been found, the question can be resolved with a cautious approach, leaning towards a negative resolution based on the absence of evidence.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

Specifically:\n    - The CDC and FDA investigated a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Africana and Salmonella Braenderup infections linked to cucumbers from Bedner Growers, Inc., and Thomas Produce Company, not Fresh Produce Inc.\n    - The recall and investigation were related to Fresh Start Produce Sales Inc., which is a different entity from Fresh Produce Inc.\n\n    Given the information available, there is no evidence that Fresh Produce Inc. was officially linked to a new Salmonella outbreak by July 31, 2024, as required by the question's resolution criteria. Therefore, based on the available data, the question can be resolved as NO.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

Specifically:\n    - Astellas' official website and press releases do not contain any such announcement.\n    - There is no indication from regulatory bodies such as the FDA or the European Medicines Agency that Astellas has withdrawn its patent or agreed to a voluntary license agreement that would allow generic production.\n    - Reputable news sources have not reported on Astellas allowing generic production of its prostate cancer drug.\n\n    The question clearly states that if no such announcement is made by July 31, 2024, the question will resolve as NO. Given that we have reached this date and no announcement has been made through the specified channels, we can confidently resolve this question.\n\n    Additionally, historical context shows that Astellas has previously resisted calls to allow generic production of its prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, despite petitions and requests from various organizations and individuals.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

There is no indication in the provided sources that such a referendum has been scheduled or conducted within this timeframe.\n\n    3. **News Reports**: The question requires that the occurrence and results of the referendum be reported by at least two major, reputable news sources. Given that no referendum has been held, there are no reports to satisfy this criterion.\n\n    Based on the available information, there is no evidence to suggest that South Carolina has held or will hold a referendum on abortion rights by July 31, 2024. Therefore, the question can be resolved with a definitive answer.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

To resolve this, we need to look at the available information up to July 2024.\n\n    1. **EPA Grant for Climate Goals**: Oregon received almost $200 million from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for various climate-related projects, including electric vehicle incentives and infrastructure. This grant is part of the EPA's Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program but does not specifically mention electric vehicle manufacturing or assembly projects.\n\n    2. **NEVI Program Funding**: Oregon received $52 million through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program to expand public fast-charging electric vehicle stations across the state. This funding is specifically for EV charging infrastructure, not manufacturing or assembly.\n\n    3. **Additional Grants**: Other grants mentioned include $15 million for the city of Tualatin and surrounding areas to install EV charging stations, and nearly $1.9 million for the city of Albany to build EV charging stations at various locations. These are also for EV charging infrastructure.\n\n    4. **West Coast Truck Charging and Fueling Corridor Project**: Oregon is part of a collaborative project with California and Washington to deploy charging and hydrogen fueling stations for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, with California receiving $102 million for this project. However, the specific amount allocated to Oregon for this project is not detailed in the provided sources.\n\n    Adding up the grants specifically for electric vehicle-related projects in Oregon that are mentioned:\n    - $200 million (EPA grant for broader climate goals, including EV incentives)\n    - $52 million (NEVI program for fast-charging stations)\n    - $15 million (Tualatin and surrounding areas for EV charging)\n    - $1.9 million (Albany for EV charging stations)\n\n    The total from these sources is $268.9 million. However, not all of these funds are explicitly for electric vehicle manufacturing or assembly projects, as required by the question. The EPA grant, while significant, is for broader climate goals and includes but is not limited to EV initiatives.\n\n    Given the information available and the specific criteria of the question, it appears that Oregon did not receive over $300 million in federal grants specifically for electric vehicle manufacturing, assembly, or related projects by July 2024. However, the lack of clarity on the allocation of funds within the broader grants and the specific focus on manufacturing or assembly projects makes a definitive answer challenging.\n\n    Considering the strict criteria and the need for explicit designation for electric vehicle-related initiatives within Oregon, the question leans towards a resolution of NO based on the available data. However, given the complexity and the potential for additional grants not covered in the provided sources, caution is warranted.\n\n    Therefore, while the evidence suggests a NO, the question's specificity and the potential for unreported grants up to July 2024 introduce uncertainty. However, based on the information provided and adhering strictly to the question's criteria, the most accurate response given the data would be NO, but with an acknowledgment of the limitations in the available information.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}

The information primarily discusses existing laws and regulations, such as the trigger ban that went into effect after the Dobbs decision.\n\n    3. **Comparison with Other Healthcare Providers**: The existing regulations in Kentucky, such as the targeted regulation of abortion providers (TRAP) laws, are stricter for abortion providers compared to other healthcare providers. However, the question specifically asks about new regulations enacted by July 2024.\n\n    4. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information, there is no evidence that Kentucky enacted new abortion regulations stricter than those for other healthcare providers by July 31, 2024. The legislative session ended in April 2024 without enacting such regulations.","can_resolve_question":true,"answer":false}},"resolution":false}}}}
