Regrettably, as atoms have become bigger, they also have become less stable, the last few elements to be created having a half-life of less than a second.\nYet it is theorized that at some point, stability of new elements might start increasing again, creating an island of stability. There are certain \"magic numbers\" of protons that offer the chance of higher stability; 114, 120 and 126 are magic numbers. We have yet to reach elements 120 and 126 and there might still be more stable isotopes of element 114 that have not yet been created.\nIt is asked:\nWill we create an isotope of an element that has more than 110 protons, that has a half-life of at least one day (86,400 seconds) prior to 2050?\nIn order for the question to resolve positive the half-life of the isotope must be verified by an independent scientific team to be greater than one day prior to 2050.\n","resolution_date":"2050-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"8d23e07b-a25f-46fa-b49e-3cb7898b88f0","title":"Will we discover clear evidence of proton decay by 2040?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nProtons are durable little subatomic particles. Our collective best guess that they should take at least\n10\n34\nyears to decay... if they do so at all.\nWhy do scientists want to figure this out? Symmetry Magazine explains the situation:\nMuch [the theoritical work on Grand Unified Theories of the universe] rests on the existence of proton decay, and yet we’ve never seen a proton die. The reason may simply be that protons rarely decay, a hypothesis borne out by both experiment and theory... Because of quantum physics, the time any given proton decays is random, so a tiny fraction will decay long before that\n10\n34\n-year lifetime. So, “what you need to do is to get a whole bunch of protons together,” says [University of California's Jonathan Feng]. Increasing the number of protons increases the chance that one of them will decay while you’re watching.\nSeveral experiments around the world have attempted (and will be attempting) to quantify the whys and wherefores of proton decay.\nTwo of the most important include:\nSuper-Kamiokande in Japan:\nIf we can collect many protons and some of them decay, we can estimate proton lifetime unless waiting for so long time. Super-Kamiokande uses 50,000 tons of pure water and it contains\n7×\n10\n33\nprotons. We are measuring proton lifetime with huge number of protons... however, we have not observed any evidence of proton decay yet.\nHyper-Kamiokande:\nHyper-Kamiokande is about 10 times larger than SK [Super-Kamiokande] and it can overtake the current reach by SK within two years... Hyper-Kamiokande has sensitivity up to more than one order longer than the current lower lifetime of proton.\nWhat do you think? Will we discover proton decay before 2040?\nQuestion resolves positive if experimental evidence for proton decay is published in a top peer-reviewed journal prior to 2040.\n","resolution_date":"2040-12-31T23:59:59Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"P_or_Q":{"id":"2370f4b4-67af-4bcb-92af-f2c9f1d04d35","title":"Will either of the following occur: (a) We create an isotope of an element with more than 110 protons having a half-life of at least one day prior to 2050, or (b) clear evidence of proton decay is discovered before 2040?","body":"Resolves YES if either of the mentioned events occur (or both).
