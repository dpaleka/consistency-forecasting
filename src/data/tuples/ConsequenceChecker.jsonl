Mars gets all the robots as well as all the movies.\nBut whither Venus? Where’s the love for our beautiful goddess neighbor who apparently welcomed the Russian Venera-13 lander by crushing it to death within hours. Informed speculation on Quora suggests that:\nThe [Venera 13] lander's seals and pressurized chambers were breached the day of the landing, so all of the material and equipment that the Venera was designed to protect was melted and boiled off decades ago.\nYikes. Okay, maybe that's why we don't drop by more often.\nVenus is often compared to a literal hellscape. We know about the surface temperatures that melt lead, the sulfuric acid clouds, the poisonous metal snow, etc.\nBut Venus is also interesting! And the clouds of Venus may be the most Earthlike environment in the solar system beyond terra firma.\nSo when will we return to our hot, hostile sister planet? Specifically, will a man made spacecraft at least breach Venus’s atmosphere before the 2020’s are out?\nPer this pessimistic Atlantic article:\nA generation has now gone by since the agency set a course for the second planet from the Sun, and with this latest mission opportunity lost, the earliest an expedition there might launch (from some future selection process) would be 2027—nearly 40 years since our last visit.\nRussia and the U.S. are considering a joint mission called Venera D, but per Space.com:\nIt's still too early to know exactly what Venera-D will look like, what it will do or when the mission will launch. A liftoff in 2025 or 2026 is possible under an \"aggressive\" time line.\nWill a human made spaceship enter the Venusian atmosphere before 2030?\nThis question will resolve positively if a human-made spacecraft enters Venus's atmosphere prior to January 1, 2030. Any craft would qualify (such as Venera 13), and the craft need not have operational systems inside the Venetian atmosphere to resolve positively. Credible reports by space agencies such as NASA or ESA will qualify as a resolution source.\n","resolution_date":"2033-12-31T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"cons_P":{"id":"1a728849-74ba-4078-9746-32985f41bd9a","title":"Will a spacecraft from a country other than Russia or the U.S. enter the Venusian atmosphere before 2030?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nThe question will resolve positively if a spacecraft from a country other than Russia or the U.S. enters Venus's atmosphere prior to January 1, 2030.

These exotic structures are the stuff of science fiction, but also have valid mathematical structures behind them in the form of spacetime \"metrics\" one can write down with the requisite properties.\nThere is one major physical issue standing in the way actually making them, however: all these possibilities require negative energy.\nMore specifically, relativists have devised a number of mathematical conditions that may be assumed regarding matter and energy, known as \"energy conditions.\" Wormhole, warp-drive, and time-machine solutions to Einstein's equations essentially always require some substance that violates the \"weak energy condition\" (WEC), and generally others. Most simply, the WEC states that in the restframe of a material, its energy density is non-negative. (Technically the substance's pressure also must be sufficiently non-negative; see e.g. here for a brief description, and a good relativity text like this one for more gory detail, and here for a recent, interesting review.)\nThese energy conditions are generically violated at the quantum level, because quantum mechanics entails uncertainty in the energy of a system over a very short time period, so must allow very brief negative-energy fluctuations. But macroscopic amounts of negative energy do not appear possible with any particles or fields we know to exist.\nOn the other hand, it is somewhat unclear what fundamentally forbids negative energy. Negative energy particles would be bad news, as they would likely render low-energy particles unstable to decay into positive and negative energy ones – such a universe would not last long. But could we devise some strange substance that has the property, using something like the Casimir effect, that takes empty space and removes some energy from it? It sees plausible that negative energy is closely related to violations of the second law of thermodynamics, which would mean that it is very, very hard to violate. But maybe not impossible. \"Violations\" of the second law (downward movements in entropy) can happen if you wait long enough, or if you set up very, very careful initial conditions (see, e.g. here) So it does not seem impossible that with a high level of tuning a sample of negative energy could be made, though the author is not at all clear how...\nSo instead we ask:\nWill a sample of negative energy material be created by the year 2100?\nTo be specific, we'll ask whether > 10 proton masses worth of negative energy will be created and confined to a volume of less than 1 cubic centimeter for longer than 1 microsecond, in such a way that during that microsecond there exists a volume of space that could be considered to have a mass of less than -10 proton masses. (As of 2017, the record for antimatter, an altogether easier substance to make, was about 300 proton masses.)\n","resolution_date":"2100-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"cons_P":{"id":"032542de-2de1-4298-925b-927f0e308a7c","title":"Will the second law of thermodynamics be violated by 2100?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nThe creation of a sample of negative energy material by the year 2100 could potentially lead to violations of the second law of thermodynamics.
