It is a once-daily injected drug based on the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), whose biology has turned out to be a goldmine for the medical management of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide, which was developed by Novo Nordisk, causes about 7% loss of body weight in people with obesity when paired with diet and exercise advice.\nBy tweaking the design of GLP-1-based drugs, Novo Nordisk discovered another drug that had a much longer half-life in the blood and a substantially larger impact on body weight: semaglutide. Semaglutide only requires one injection per week and produces average weight losses of 15-18% in people with obesity when paired with diet and exercise advice. Initially approved at lower doses for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the FDA approved a higher dose (2.4 mg) for the treatment of obesity in June 2021. It’s marketed under the brand name Wegovy in the US, and Ozempic or Rybelsus in other markets.\nGiven the checkered history of weight loss drugs, it’s reasonable to be cautious about their safety. Semaglutide and related drugs often cause unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, and headache, but these are typically mild and transient if the dose is started low and escalated slowly. Few people discontinue semaglutide due to side effects.\nSome studies have suggested that this class of drugs may increase the risk of thyroid and pancreatic cancer in lab rodents. Yet randomized controlled trials including 64,000 people with type 2 diabetes have not observed an increased risk of cancer, overall or at any specific site in humans. These trials are limited in duration and don’t yet have enough people to reliably identify modest increases in the risk of low-frequency outcomes like thyroid and pancreatic cancer. Observational monitoring data are mixed but have not provided a clear signal of increased risk.\nImportantly, trials suggest that semaglutide reduces major cardiovascular events by about one quarter, similar to cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. Furthermore, across seven trials in people with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide and related drugs reduce the overall risk of dying by 12%. These findings are reassuring, but monitoring is ongoing and some concern remains.\n"},"resolution":null}},"verification_result":{"reasoning":"Both events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.

Non-state actors have never yet detonated nuclear weapons, but there are conceivable scenarios in which they could:\nThe majority of nuclear security experts identify two primary scenarios involving nuclear weapons and non-state actors. The first scenario involves the acquisition of a nuclear device from the existing arsenals of nuclear-armed States by terrorists or other non-state actors. The second scenario envisions the construction of a crude nuclear bomb by non-state actors using special nuclear materials—highly enriched uranium (HEU) or plutonium (Pu). The actualization of each of these scenarios would be very difficult, and the probability of a successful theft and detonation of an actual nuclear weapon or manufacturing of an improvised device by non-state actors is considered to be low.

These principles are:\nPrinciple 1: Geoengineering is to be regulated as a public good\nPrinciple 2: The public should participate in geoengineering decision-making\nPrinciple 3: Geoengineering research and results should be publicly disclosed\nPrinciple 4: There should be independent assessments of the impacts\nPrinciple 5: governance systems should be developed before geoengineering methods are deployed\nAs of September 2019, two geoengineering bills and one resolution have been introduced in Congress. These bills are the following:\nGeoengineering Research Evaluation Act of 2017. This bill recommends a research agenda for advancing understanding of albedo modification strategies that involve atmospheric interventions, such as cloud modification; and a report that provides specific guidance on the governance mechanisms for the proposed research agenda.\nAmerican Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009. This bill requires the Secretary of Energy to establish an Advisory Committee on Geosciences and Geoengineering Education to advise the Secretary in education and training in the subsurface geosciences and engineering.\nNeither the Geoengineering Research Evaluation Act of 2017 nor the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009 became legislation. So far, the U.S. has not enacted legislation that are explicitly related to geoengineering.\nWill a geoengineering act of Congress become US federal law by the end of 2024?\nThis questions resolves positively if a geoengineering bill that is introduced in the House of Representatives and/or the Senate is subsequently enacted as legislation (by being signed by the U.S. president, or through other means) before or on 31/12/2024. For the purpose of this question, a geoengineering bill is any bill reported by the relevant Congress website search. This search involves the following terms:\n\"Climate engineering\" OR \"geoengineering\" OR \"Solar radiation management\" OR \"Stratospheric Particle Injection\" OR \"Stratospheric aerosol injection\" OR \"Marine cloud brightening\" OR \"Ocean sulfur cycle enhancement\"\n","resolution_date":"2024-12-31T00:00:00","question_type":"binary","data_source":"metaculus","url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3528","metadata":{"topics":[],"background_info":""},"resolution":null}},"verification_result":{"reasoning":"The two questions are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.

Criteria include no successful control of seizures throughout a variety of drug trials, and a reasonable to high chance of procedural success.\nOne such predictor of success is often the age of the patient.

But not all risks are created equally. Those that are especially large in scope and severe in intensity are global catastrophic risks, which are risks that could inflict serious damage to human well-being on a global scale.\nUntil relatively recently, most global catastrophic risks were natural, such as the supervolcano episodes and asteroidal/cometary impacts that led to mass extinctions millions of years ago. Other natural risks might include a pandemic of naturally occurring disease, non-anthropogenic climate change, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and spontaneous decay of cosmic vacuum state. Humanity has survived these natural existential risks for hundreds of thousands of years; which suggests that it is not any of these that will do us in within the next hundred.\nBy contrast, through technological advances, our species is introducing entirely new kinds of risks, anthropogenic risks, which are man-made threats that have no track record of surviving. Our longevity as a species therefore offers no strong prior grounds for confident optimism. Examples of anthropogenic risks are nuclear war, advanced artificial intelligence, biotechnology and bioengineered organisms, human-made climate change and nanotechnology risks.\nThere are two complementary ways of estimating the chances of catastrophe. What we could call the direct way is to analyze the various specific failure-modes, assign them probabilities, which is what--at least partially-- the questions in the Ragnarök series are designed to do.\nSecondly, there is the indirect way. As Nick Bostrom has argued, there are theoretical constraints that can be brought to bear on the issue, based on some general features of the world in which we live. There is only small number of these, but they are important because they do not rely on making a lot of guesses about the details of future technological and social developments. For example, the so-called Doomsday argument, which purports to show that we have systematically underestimated the probability that humankind will go extinct relatively soon.\nMoreover, the Fermi Paradox tells us that it is not the case that life evolves on a significant fraction of Earth-like planets and proceeds to develop advanced technology. Hence, there must be (at least) one Great Filter – an evolutionary step that is extremely improbable – somewhere on the line between Earth-like planet and colonizing-in-detectable-ways civilization. If the Great Filter isn’t in our past, we must fear it in our (near) future.\n"},"resolution":null}},"verification_result":{"reasoning":"The two questions are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.

The shrinking of transistors to dimensions below 100 nm enables hundreds of millions transistors to be placed on a single chip. However, it is well-known that the currently most commonly used semiconductor device design method that has dominated for the past two-three decades, planar CMOS, runs into serious issues at the microscopic scale.\nOne of these issue arises from practical limits related to 'leak' current at small gate lengths (Thompson et al, 2006). This leakage current wastes power, raises the temperature and, if excessive, can cause the device to fail. Leakage becomes a serious problem when insulating barriers within transistors approach thicknesses of 3 nanometres or so (currently, in 2019, some transistors are ~ 5nm thick).

Conventional conflict seems likely to increase the chance of an offensive nuclear detonation. However, it is also possible for a deliberate, inadvertent, or accidental nuclear detonation to happen without being preceded by conventional conflict, and this was a common worry during the Cold War in particular.\nWill the next offensive detonation of a state's nuclear weapon be immediately preceded by conventional conflict?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the next offensive detonation of a state's nuclear weapon occurs within three months of a fatality due to conventional conflict between that nuclear state and another state. Detonations for testing purposes, peaceful nuclear explosions, and accidental detonations of a state's weapon on its own territory will not count towards question resolution, even if such detonations cause substantial damage. A detonation by a non-state actor that has seized a state's nuclear weapon can count towards positive resolution, but a detonation of a weapon the non-state actor built themselves cannot.\nThis question will resolve as Ambiguous if there is no offensive detonation of a state's nuclear weapon by January 1, 2050.\nFor the purposes of this question, conventional conflict means any clash between opposing state forces that results in at least one fatality caused by non-nuclear weapons.
