If no such tests are conducted, resolves as AMBIGUOUS.\nAssume that prior to 2040, a generalized intelligence test will be administered as follows. A team of three expert interviewers will interact with a candidate machine system (MS) and three humans (3H). The humans will be graduate students in each of physics, mathematics and computer science from one of the top 25 research universities (per some recognized list), chosen independently of the interviewers. The interviewers will electronically communicate (via text, image, spoken word, or other means) an identical series of exam questions of their choosing over a period of two hours to the MS and 3H, designed to advantage the 3H. Both MS and 3H have full access to the internet, but no party is allowed to consult additional humans, and we assume the MS is not an internet-accessible resource. The exam will be scored blindly by a disinterested third party.\nNote that this also effectively tests whether the internet as a whole functions as a human-level intelligence, in that a positive resolution indicates that the human participants are effectively superfluous.\n","resolution_date":"2040-01-01T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"Q_and_not_P":{"id":"f1f90888-3035-4225-8b8f-952dfa400b31","title":"Will we discover clear evidence of proton decay by 2040 AND will there not be Human-machine intelligence parity before 2040?","body":"Resolves YES if both of the following are true: 1) Experimental evidence for proton decay is published in a top peer-reviewed journal prior to 2040, and 2) The machine system does not outscore at least two of the three humans on a generalized intelligence test administered prior to 2040.
