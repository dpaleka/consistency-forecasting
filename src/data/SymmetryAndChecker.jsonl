If no authoritative source is available by the resolution date, the question will resolve as N/A (not applicable).\n\nIn the case of extraordinary circumstances that significantly disrupt the ability to measure GDP accurately (e.g., major economic reforms, changes in statistical methodology, or data reporting standards), a fallback scenario will involve a panel of three economic experts, chosen in good faith by the question author, to estimate the GDP growth rate based on available data and expert judgment. Their majority opinion will be used to resolve the question.\n\n","resolution_date":"2031-01-31T00:00:00","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"P_and_Q":{"id":"63f845bf-95ba-4e86-b12d-9d9cb2794c95","title":"What is the probability that a woman will be elected as the President of the United States between 2024 and 2030 AND France's Gross Domestic Product will increase by more than 3% annually between 2024 and 2030?","body":"Resolves YES if between January 20, 2025, and January 20, 2031, a woman is inaugurated as the President of the United States AND the annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of France, as reported by the World Bank or the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), increases by more than 3% per annum for each year between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2030.
