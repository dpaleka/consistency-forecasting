It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit by the USSR on 4 October 1957 as part of the Soviet space program. It orbited for three weeks before its batteries died and then orbited silently for two months before it fell back into the atmosphere on the 4th January 1958.\n[...]\nThe satellite's unanticipated success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, part of the Cold War. The launch was the beginning of a new era of political, military, technological and scientific developments.\nAn \"AI Sputnik moment\" would, by contrast, be a sudden understanding by the general public that artificial intelligence is worth taking extremely seriously, perhaps triggering a similar AI arms race.\n"},"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"bd504fde-c523-4ce9-86b4-04c4b18f3071","title":"If there is at least one nuclear detonation by 2030, in which countries will there be at least one fatality?
