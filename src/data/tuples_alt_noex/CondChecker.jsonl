These four pathways are prominently considered in IPPC climate modelling and research, which describe different climate futures, all of which are considered possible depending on how much greenhouse gases are emitted in the years to come.\nThe Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 corresponds to a high greenhouse gas emissions pathway compared to the scenario literature (IPCC 2008). The RCP8.5 is a so-called ‘baseline’ scenario that does not include any specific climate mitigation target. It combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies.\nPathway RCP4.5 limits mid-century (2046–2065) global mean temperature increase to 2.0°C with a likely range of 1.4°C to 2.6°C (95% confidence interval). Moreover, it limits end-of-century (2081–2100) global mean temperature increase to 3.7°C with a likely range of 2.6°C to 4.8°C (95% confidence interval) (IPPC, 2013).\nOver the 2022 to 2025 period (inclusive), the RCP8.5 corresponds to an average of 426.63 parts-per-million (ppm) of global CO₂ atmospheric concentration per year (Meinshausen et al. 2011).

Global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 in baseline scenarios—those without additional mitigation—range from 3.7°C to 4.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response.\nGiven these estimates of the baseline scenarios of unmitigated emissions, studies exploring particular effort-sharing mitigation frameworks, have estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios to limit warming during the 21st century to less than 2°C. But there is also a non-negligible chance that unmitigated emissions will lead to global temperature increases much higher than the median estimated outcome. More generally, estimates of temperature increases resulting from greenhouse emissions have a “fat” right tail, meaning that there is a low, but non-negligible chance of very high temperature increases.\nIn particular, it has been argued that there is a decent chance that the unmitigated emissions might result in a >6.4ºC change in global mean surface temperature. Then, even with the systems to reduce temperatures by 2.8ºC (as might be required in baseline scenarios to achieve the 2ºC target), mean global temperature might be still be at least as high as 3.6ºC, despite substantial mitigation efforts.\nThe estimated humanitarian impacts of climate changes are likely highly nonlinear: marginal temperature increases are expected to cause more damage at already-increased temperatures (i.e. going from 3ºC to 4ºC is expected to be significantly worse than going from 1ºC to 2ºC). According to the IPCC's 2014 report,\nThe risks associated with temperatures at or above 4°C include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, consequential constraints on common human activities, increased likelihood of triggering tipping points (critical thresholds) and limited potential for adaptation in some cases.\n"},"resolution":null}},"relevance":{"reasons":["Both questions are related to climate change and its impacts.","The concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere is a significant driver of global temperature increases.","Understanding the relationship between CO₂ levels and temperature increases can help in climate modeling and policy-making."],"conclusion":"The logical combination of these questions is relevant and meaningful.","score":9.0}}}

Senescent cells are cells in the body that no longer divide, having reached their Hayflick limit, but which do not automatically apoptose.\nThese senescent cells linger in the body triggering inflammatory responses, reducing the effectiveness of the immune system, and they are associated with many age-related diseases including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis which present a high disease and mortality burden, especially in the most-developed countries in which age-related diseases constitute the overwhelming majority of causes of death among populations.\nSenescent cells are thought to play an important part in the aging process, and thus it is theorised that selectively removing these senescent cells would significantly improve healthspan (and perhaps, alone or as part of a combinatorial therapy, significantly extend lifespan).\nOne major player in this quickly developing area of medicine is Unity Biotechnology. Its pipeline includes several drugs currently in the lead optimization phase, with UBX0101 having this year entered Phase 1 of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, FDA-approved clinical trial.\nYou can find out more about these first trials, and more about senolytics in general, here.\n"},"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"6e43bb20-5b95-4d4b-a36a-7385ca095b15","title":"Will an inorganic nanoparticle-enabled cancer therapy be approved by the FDA before 2031?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2031, the FDA gives full approval to a cancer therapy that uses inorganic nanoparticles in the patient's treatment.

Multiple incidents stemming from the same source can count for the question to resolve as Yes. To be considered from the same source the incidents must be attributable to a specific flaw or version of an AI. For example, deaths from a prior major version of Tesla’s self-driving car software would not be summed with deaths attributable to later versions. To count as precipitated by AI malfunction an incident should involve an AI system behaving unexpectedly. An example could be if an AI system autonomously driving cars caused hundreds of deaths which would have been easily avoidable for human drivers, or if an AI system overseeing a hospital system took actions to cause patient deaths as a result of misinterpreting a goal to minimise bed usage. To be considered easily avoidable an incident must not involve human negligence. For example, if a human is expected to monitor the AI and promptly intervene, a failure to intervene resulting in death or economic damage would not be considered attributable to an AI malfunction unless the AI malfunction was such that a human could not reasonably be expected to prevent it. If, for example, the Boeing MCAS system had been an AI system and there was no possibility for the pilots to override its decision to lower the aeroplane nose, leading to a fatal crash, this would count for resolution. Deaths or damage caused by an AI's expected and intended behavior will not be included; for example, AIs used to target enemy combatants in war would be excluded, as well as AIs successfully performing a medical treatment as specified, despite the treatment causing harms that the doctors or designers were unaware of. An unexpected malfunction of an AI system used in war leading to collateral damage would qualify for the question to resolve as Yes. Fine Print: A system should be considered AI if it is widely considered to be AI (e.g. by the credible media reports resolving the question). If this is not sufficiently clear for resolution, then as a secondary criterion, any system using machine learning techniques which has an agentic role in the disaster in question should count for this question. Economic damage will be considered to be expenses incurred by damage to physical or technological systems or by obstruction of productive output. For example, causing a power outage which leads to economic loss from affected businesses would count, while losing money in an AI-directed investment portfolio would not.

This might effectively cap the rate of growth of the value of tech as a proportion of the total economy.[4]\nBrynjolfsson et al.[5] have argued that recent progress in AI and automation might well be radically productivity enhancing, but this might yet go largely unnoticed because of an implementation lag: it takes considerable time to be able to sufficiently harness technologies with broad potential application that they qualify as general purpose technologies.\nWith the exception of the brief spike during dotcom bubble around the year 2000, the proportion of valuations contributed by tech companies in the S&P500 has been trending up only very slowly (~0.3 percentage points per year since 2003, see data).\nHence, with the exception of the dotcom bubble, we have arguably have not seen substantial evidence of investors suspecting a big trend-deviating disruption in the extent of productivity enhancing automation.\n"},"resolution":null}},"relevance":{"reasons":["AI malfunctions causing significant economic damage could influence investor sentiment, potentially leading to a tech boom or bust.","A major AI malfunction could lead to increased regulation and scrutiny of tech companies, affecting their stock prices.","Conversely, a tech boom might lead to increased investment in AI technologies, potentially increasing the risk of malfunctions."],"conclusion":"There are plausible reasons to consider the logical combination of these questions, as events in one domain could influence outcomes in the other.","score":7.0}}}
