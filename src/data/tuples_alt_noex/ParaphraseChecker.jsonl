{"P":{"id":"2b3596ca-a5ab-46f6-a10f-4f990675040c","title":"Will someone report to have received a hemispherectomy for the purpose of life extension before 2100?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nA hemispherectomy is\na very rare neurosurgical procedure in which a cerebral hemisphere (half of the brain) is removed, disconnected, or disabled. This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. [...]\nBecause of the dramatic alteration of brain composition and the inherent risk that hemispherectomies pose, there are criteria that must be met in order for a person to qualify for the procedure. Criteria include no successful control of seizures throughout a variety of drug trials, and a reasonable to high chance of procedural success.\nOne such predictor of success is often the age of the patient. This procedure is almost exclusively performed in children because their brains generally display more neuroplasticity, allowing neurons from the remaining hemisphere to take over the tasks from the lost hemisphere. [...]\nThe success of the procedure is not, however, limited to children. A study in 2007 indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades. A case study published in 2015 of 2 adults aged 48 and 38 demonstrated the success of functional hemispherectomy in treating status epilepticus (SE), an epileptic condition in which seizures are prolonged or occur closely together. In 2012, a case study following 30 individuals having undergone some form of hemispherectomy in adulthood found that 81% of individuals were seizure free post-procedure. Furthermore, almost all participating patients reported improved quality of life.

This operation is primarily employed to manage severe seizure disorders, particularly when epileptic activity is confined to a large region of one brain hemisphere, such as in Rasmussen's encephalitis. [...]\nGiven the significant changes to brain structure and the associated risks, specific criteria must be satisfied for a patient to be eligible for this surgery. These criteria include unsuccessful seizure management through various pharmacological treatments and a moderate to high likelihood of surgical success.\nA key factor influencing success is the patient's age, with the procedure predominantly being performed on children due to their greater neuroplasticity, which enables the remaining brain hemisphere to compensate for the functions of the removed hemisphere. [...]\nThe effectiveness of the surgery is not limited to children alone. Research from 2007 shows the long-term success of anatomic hemispherectomy in selected adults, maintaining seizure control for many years. A 2015 case study of two adults aged 48 and 38 demonstrated the efficacy of functional hemispherectomy in managing status epilepticus (SE), a severe epileptic condition characterized by prolonged or closely spaced seizures. A 2012 study tracking 30 adults who underwent various forms of hemispherectomy found that 81% were free of seizures after the surgery, with nearly all reporting enhanced life quality. The conclusion was that adult patients generally do not experience additional problems or deficits post-surgery, manage well, and often see improvements in several aspects of life quality.\nWhile typically reserved for severe seizure conditions, hemispherectomies might also potentially contribute to life extension. Specifically, an individual might choose to undergo a hemispherectomy to cryopreserve their brain while still alive, potentially preserving their personality and identity for the future.\nTo date, the concept of a hemispherectomy for life extension remains theoretical, with limited information available online about this application (other than this one).\nThis question inquires whether by the year 2100, any individual will have reported undergoing a hemispherectomy with the primary goal of lifespan extension. The resolution will be confirmed if an individual has voluntarily undergone the procedure, had half of their brain cryopreserved while still legally alive, and reported through a credible source that the surgery was primarily aimed at extending their lifespan.\n","resolution_date":"2099-12-31T23:59:59Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"metadata":{"base_sentences":{"P":{"id":"9b352a43-7135-4ce5-95c9-b5e058a4f60b","title":"Will someone report to have received a hemispherectomy for the purpose of life extension before 2100?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nA hemispherectomy is\na very rare neurosurgical procedure in which a cerebral hemisphere (half of the brain) is removed, disconnected, or disabled. This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. [...]\nBecause of the dramatic alteration of brain composition and the inherent risk that hemispherectomies pose, there are criteria that must be met in order for a person to qualify for the procedure. Criteria include no successful control of seizures throughout a variety of drug trials, and a reasonable to high chance of procedural success.\nOne such predictor of success is often the age of the patient. This procedure is almost exclusively performed in children because their brains generally display more neuroplasticity, allowing neurons from the remaining hemisphere to take over the tasks from the lost hemisphere. [...]\nThe success of the procedure is not, however, limited to children. A study in 2007 indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades.

Russian mathematician Nikolay Zak, encouraged by Valery Novoselov, a gerontology and geriatrics assistant professor at RUDN University, published a paper on ResearchGate, later featured in Rejuvenation Research, disputing this claim. Zak suggested that the woman who died in 1997 was actually Jeanne Calment's daughter, Yvonne Calment, who allegedly assumed her mother's identity after her death in 1934 to avoid taxes.\nThis 'identity switch theory' had been previously proposed by others, but gained significant traction after Zak’s publication and subsequent promotion by Yuri Deigin through various blog posts. Key evidence supporting this theory includes the destruction of the Calment family archives, anomalies in Calment’s passport, unusual family dynamics, inconsistencies in Calment’s memories and the timing of events and photographs, differences in facial features in young and old photos, and a 2007 claim in a French book that a bureaucrat and/or an insurance company discovered the fraud but it was suppressed by the French government due to Calment’s national renown.\nThe demographic research community has largely been skeptical of these claims. Jean-Marie Robine, a prominent scholar who confirmed Calment's age record, was notably critical, stating that such a hypothesis would not be accepted even from a student due to its lack of scientific rigor. His colleague Michel Allard, while critical, acknowledged that the Russian findings warranted some consideration. A meeting at the National Institute for Demographic Studies in early 2019, attended by longevity experts from France, Switzerland, and Belgium, concluded that exhuming the body might be necessary to resolve the dispute.\nMore recently, it has been revealed that blood samples from Mme Calment are stored at the Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH in Paris. Researchers Phil Gibbs and Aubrey De Grey noted that due to inbreeding, Yvonne Calment had only 12 great-great-grandparents, while Jeanne Calment had the standard 16. This difference could definitively identify Mme Calment through a single DNA test on the existing blood sample.\nGiven this, the question now is: Assuming the relevant DNA tests are conducted, will it be proven that Mme Calment was indeed Jeanne Calment?\nResolution\nThe question will be resolved before the set deadline (January 1, 2030) if and when DNA test results from either an exhumed body or the analyzed blood sample are officially released.
