Geoengineering involves the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, or attempts at reflecting more energy away from the planet to counter warming (Markusson et al., 2013). Geoengineering is often presented as a complement, and sometimes alternative, to climate mitigation and adaptation.\nThere are serious and complex governance issues which need to be resolved if geoengineering is ever to become an acceptable method for moderating climate change. It would be highly undesirable for irreversible global geoengineering to occur before appropriate governance mechanisms are in place. The Royal Society has published a set of geoengineering governance principles, known as The Oxford Principles, which aims to guide the collaborative development of geoengineering governance, from the earliest stages of research, to any eventual deployment. These principles are:\nPrinciple 1: Geoengineering is to be regulated as a public good\nPrinciple 2: The public should participate in geoengineering decision-making\nPrinciple 3: Geoengineering research and results should be publicly disclosed\nPrinciple 4: There should be independent assessments of the impacts\nPrinciple 5: governance systems should be developed before geoengineering methods are deployed\nAs of September 2019, two geoengineering bills and one resolution have been introduced in Congress. These bills are the following:\nGeoengineering Research Evaluation Act of 2017. This bill recommends a research agenda for advancing understanding of albedo modification strategies that involve atmospheric interventions, such as cloud modification; and a report that provides specific guidance on the governance mechanisms for the proposed research agenda.\nAmerican Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009.
