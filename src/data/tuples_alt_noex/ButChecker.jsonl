As artificial intelligence researchers continue to make progress, though, these domains are highly likely to grow in number and breadth over time. Many experts now believe there is a significant chance that a machine superintelligence – a system that can outperform humans at all relevant intelligence tasks – will be developed within the next century, and possibly much sooner.\nIn a 2017 survey of artificial intelligence experts, the median expert estimated that there is a 50% chance of human-level artificial intelligence by 2062, and after this milestone were reached, respondents reported a 10% chance that superintelligence would be achieved within two years. Our very own question on the prospect of human-machine intelligence parity by 2040 currently has a median prediction of 60%. In another question on the possibility of progress toward human-machine intelligence parity surprising us, a similar median estimate is given.\nIn the aforementioned survey, experts were asked about the effects of human level machine intelligence. They assigned a 10% for a bad outcome and 5% for an outcome described as “Extremely Bad (e.g., human extinction).” Although a selection bias, large variance in responses (reflecting vast uncertainty), and the unreliability of subjective opinions mean that these estimates warrant skepticism, they nevertheless suggest that the possibility of superintelligence ought to be taken seriously.\nWhen considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely (according to the Future of Life Institute):\nThe AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply “turn off,” so humans could plausibly lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that’s present even with narrow AI, but grows as levels of AI intelligence and autonomy increase.\nThe AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal: This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI’s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you there chased by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing not what you wanted but literally what you asked for. If a superintelligent system is tasked with a ambitious geoengineering project, it might wreak havoc with our ecosystem as a side effect, and view human attempts to stop it as a threat to be met. As these examples illustrate, the concern about advanced AI isn’t malevolence but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we have a problem. You’re probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you’re in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants.\nIn the headline question to this series, I defined a global catastrophe as a 10% decrease in the world population in any period of 5 years.\nThis question is part of the Ragnarök Question Series. Check out the other questions in the series:\nIf a global biological catastrophe occurs, will it reduce the human population by 95% or more?\nIf an artificial intelligence catastrophe occurs, will it reduce the human population by 95% or more?\nIf a nuclear catastrophe occurs, will it reduce the human population by 95% or more?\nIf a global climate disaster occurs by 2100, will the human population decline by 95% or more?\nIf a global nanotechnology catastrophe occurs by 2100, will the human population decline by 95% or more?\nAlso, please check out our questions on whether a global catastrophe will occur by 2100, and if so, which?:\nBy 2100 will the human population decrease by at least 10% during any period of 5 years?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to either human-made climate change or geoengineering?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to a nanotechnology failure-mode?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to nuclear war?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to an artificial intelligence failure-mode?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to biotechnology or bioengineered organisms?\nAll results are analysed here, and will be updated periodically.\n"},"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"edba9950-7a84-4082-b5d1-724ffd36a5c9","title":"In January 2025, will we see \"3 US Code § 15\" objections debated for the 2024 election on enough states where their total electoral count would be enough to change the outcome of the election?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nThis question resolves positively if enough states are debated under 3 US Code § 15 after the 2024 US Presidential Election such that some combination of these states' electoral votes being flipped to another candidate would change the outcome of the election","resolution_date":"2025-01-31T23:59:59Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"metaculus","url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7832","metadata":{"topics":[],"background_info":"Under 3 U.S.C. §15, the US Houses of Congress meet on January 6th following the election to count the votes of the electoral college.\nIf there are any objections to the returns from any state, they must be resolved before the process can continue to the next state.

But we know that the worst-case attributes can be realized independently. For example, some diseases exhibit nearly a 100% case fatality ratio in the absence of treatment, such as rabies or septicemic plague. The 1918 flu has a track record of spreading to virtually every human community worldwide. Chickenpox and HSV-1, can reportedly reach over 95% of a given population.\nAn informal survey at the 2008 Oxford Global Catastrophic Risk Conference asked participants to estimate the chance that disasters of different types would occur before 2100. Participants had a median risk estimate of 0.05% that a natural pandemic would lead to human extinction by 2100, and a median risk estimate of 2% that an “engineered” pandemic would lead to extinction by 2100.\nMoreover, previous literature has found that casualty numbers from terrorism and warfare follow a power law distribution, including terrorism from WMDs. Millett and Snyder-Beattie have performed a naive power law extrapolation to estimate the chance of an existential biological disaster:\nPast studies have estimated this ratio for terrorism using biological and chemical weapons to be about 0.5 for 1 order of magnitude, meaning that an attack that kills\n10\nx\npeople is about 3 times less likely (\n10\n0.5\n) than an attack that kills\n10\nx\nx−1\npeople (a concrete example is that attacks with more than 1,000 casualties, such as the Aum Shinrikyo attacks, will be about 30 times less probable than an attack that kills a single individual). Extrapolating the power law out, we find that the probability that an attack kills more than 5 billion will be\n(5billion\n)\n–0.5\nor 0.000014. Assuming 1 attack per year (extrapolated on the current rate of bio-attacks) and assuming that only 10% of such attacks that kill more than 5 billion eventually lead to extinction (due to the breakdown of society, or other knock-on effects), we get an annual existential risk of 0.0000014 (or\n1.4×\n10\n−6\n).\nThis question is part of the Ragnarök Question Series. Check out the other questions in the series:\nIf a global biological catastrophe occurs, will it reduce the human population by 95% or more?\nIf an artificial intelligence catastrophe occurs, will it reduce the human population by 95% or more?\nIf a nuclear catastrophe occurs, will it reduce the human population by 95% or more?\nIf a global climate disaster occurs by 2100, will the human population decline by 95% or more?\nIf a global nanotechnology catastrophe occurs by 2100, will the human population decline by 95% or more?\nAlso, please check out our questions on whether a global catastrophe will occur by 2100, and if so, which?:\nBy 2100 will the human population decrease by at least 10% during any period of 5 years?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to either human-made climate change or geoengineering?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to a nanotechnology failure-mode?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to nuclear war?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to an artificial intelligence failure-mode?\nWill such a catastrophe be due to biotechnology or bioengineered organisms?\nAll results are analysed here, and will be updated periodically.\n"},"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"ef2de6e4-3d39-4531-98d8-e1384cb64138","title":"Who will be elected to be US President in 2024?

But not all risks are created equally. Those that are especially large in scope and severe in intensity are global catastrophic risks, which are risks that could inflict serious damage to human well-being on a global scale.\nUntil relatively recently, most global catastrophic risks were natural, such as the supervolcano episodes and asteroidal/cometary impacts that led to mass extinctions millions of years ago. Other natural risks might include a pandemic of naturally occurring disease, non-anthropogenic climate change, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and spontaneous decay of cosmic vacuum state. Humanity has survived these natural existential risks for hundreds of thousands of years; which suggests that it is not any of these that will do us in within the next hundred.\nBy contrast, through technological advances, our species is introducing entirely new kinds of risks, anthropogenic risks, which are man-made threats that have no track record of surviving. Our longevity as a species therefore offers no strong prior grounds for confident optimism. Examples of anthropogenic risks are nuclear war, advanced artificial intelligence, biotechnology and bioengineered organisms, human-made climate change and nanotechnology risks.\nThere are two complementary ways of estimating the chances of catastrophe. What we could call the direct way is to analyze the various specific failure-modes, assign them probabilities, which is what--at least partially-- the questions in the Ragnarök series are designed to do.\nSecondly, there is the indirect way. As Nick Bostrom has argued, there are theoretical constraints that can be brought to bear on the issue, based on some general features of the world in which we live. There is only small number of these, but they are important because they do not rely on making a lot of guesses about the details of future technological and social developments. For example, the so-called Doomsday argument, which purports to show that we have systematically underestimated the probability that humankind will go extinct relatively soon.\nMoreover, the Fermi Paradox tells us that it is not the case that life evolves on a significant fraction of Earth-like planets and proceeds to develop advanced technology. Hence, there must be (at least) one Great Filter – an evolutionary step that is extremely improbable – somewhere on the line between Earth-like planet and colonizing-in-detectable-ways civilization. If the Great Filter isn’t in our past, we must fear it in our (near) future.\n"},"resolution":null}},"relevance":{"reasons":["The development of AGI could lead to significant societal changes, including economic disruptions, shifts in power structures, and technological advancements.

If information is unclear, then resolution will be left up to Metaculus admins.\nIn a deliberate detonation, the attacking nation decides to launch one or more nuclear weapons either in response to a genuine nuclear attack or without believing that it is under nuclear attack. “In an inadvertent detonation, the attacking nation mistakenly concludes that it is under nuclear attack and launches one or more nuclear weapons in what it believes is a counterattack” (Barrett et al., 2013). “In an accidental or unauthorized launch or detonation, system safeguards or procedures to maintain control over nuclear weapons fail in such a way that a nuclear weapon or missile launches or explodes without direction from leaders” (Barrett et al., 2013).\n","resolution_date":"2033-12-31T23:59:59Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"metaculus","url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8381","metadata":{"topics":[],"background_info":""},"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"b0966e83-248c-4194-87b5-8e5f09342d74","title":"Will there be more people with HIV/AIDS in 2037 than in 2017?","body":"Resolution Criteria\nThe human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are two species of Lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\nAIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.\nHIV/AIDS has had a large impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large economic impacts.[1]\nAccording to UNAIDS, in 2017 (the latest data available) 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV, 1.8 million people became newly infected with HIV, and 940,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2017. In 2017, 21.7 million people living with HIV were accessing antiretroviral therapy, an increase of 2.3 million since 2016, and up from 8 million in 2010.\nAccording to Avert.org, a UK-based charity, the vast majority of people living with HIV are located in low-income and middle-income countries, with an estimated 66% living in sub-Saharan Africa.[2] Among this group 19.6 million are living in East and Southern Africa which saw 800,000 new HIV infections in 2017.\nSince the start of the epidemic, an estimated 77.3 million people have become infected with HIV and 35.4 million people have died of AIDS-related illnesses.[3] In 2017, 940,000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses. This number has reduced by more than 51% (1.9 million) since the peak in 2004 and 1.4 million in 2010.\nSubstantial progress has been made in devising successful therapies against HIV replication that can provide a sustained control of HIV replication.[4] Among them, immunotherapeutic approaches are one of the exciting areas, with surprising recent progress toward a possible permanent eradication of the virus in patients.\nThis question asks: will the number of people globally living with HIV/AIDS in 2037 be 36.9 million or more, according to the median estimate from UNAIDS?\n","resolution_date":"2037-12-31T23:59:59Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"metaculus","url":"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/2713","metadata":{"topics":[],"background_info":""},"resolution":null}},"relevance":{"reasons":["A nuclear conflict involving more than 100 detonations could lead to widespread societal collapse, which might disrupt healthcare systems globally.
