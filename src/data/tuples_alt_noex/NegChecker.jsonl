The test was conducted above ground on July 16, 1945 on what is now known as the White Sands Missile Range. Since Trinity, over 2,000 nuclear tests have been conducted world wide.\nThe US has conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests. The final test to be conducted by the US, code-name Divder, took place on September 23, 1992. Soon after, Gearge H. W. Bush declared a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing. In 1996, the US signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which bans any type of nuclear explosion. To date, the treaty has not been ratified by the appropriate countries (including the US) and has not yet entered into force.\nThe decision to end nuclear weapons testing has not been recommended by everyone. One of the core missions of the National Nuclear Security Administration is to \"ensure the United States maintains a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile through the application of unparalleled science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing.\" This is largely accomplished through super computers. However, some argue that weapons tests are still needed to accomplish this mission.\nMore recently, there have been reports that the Trump administration has considered performing a nuclear test explosion in response to potential low-yield tests from Russia and China.\n"},"resolution":null}}}}

Police abolitionists believe that policing, as a system, is inherently flawed and cannot be reformed—a view that rejects the ideology of police reformists. While reformists seek to address the ways in which policing occurs, abolitionists seek to transform policing altogether through a process of disbanding, disempowering, and disarming the police. Abolitionists argue that the institution of policing is deeply rooted in a history of white supremacy and settler colonialism, and that it is inseparable from a pre-existing racial capitalist order.\nIn the summer of 2020, a movement to dismantle the Minneapolis police department became supported by a majority of the members of the Minneapolis city council, but was later abandoned.\nSome have questioned the practicality of police abolition, asking whether it would be possible to maintain a society with no police without it devolving into lawlessness and chaos. As one potential response, the capitalist philosopher Michael Huemer has written at length about how a society that abolished government policing could maintain the public order. From his book The Problem of Political Authority,\nAccording to a recent report, there are now 20 million private security guards worldwide – about twice as many as the number of government police. In America, private security guards number about 1 million, compared to 700,000 government police. In some cases, the government itself hires private security guards to protect public spaces, including the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, the Statue of Liberty in New York, and the main bus terminal in Durham, North Carolina. If this trend continues, we could one day see a situation in which all public spaces are protected by private security guards.\nIn many countries – the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and others – private citizens are legally authorized to make citizens’ arrests. The conditions for a legal citizen’s arrest, however, tend to be much more restricted than the conditions under which government police may make an arrest. Legal authorization for citizens’ arrests may be limited to certain kinds of crimes, and the arresting citizen may be required to personally witness the crime in progress. One could imagine a liberalization of such laws, permitting citizens’ arrests for all crimes, including cases in which the suspect’s guilt is established by investigation after the fact.\n"},"resolution":null}}}}

See the tournament page for details.\nSoy remains one of the most popular plant based alternatives because it contains high levels of protein, and like animal proteins, is a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids needed for the human body. Soy based products like tofu and soy milk also contain less saturated fat than their meat and dairy counterparts, making it an ideal substitute for traditional animal products.\nSoy became popular as an alternative protein source by Atkins in the mid 20th century as the main ingredient in TVP (texturized vegetable protein).\n“The original textured vegetable protein or TVP, which we helped to formulate and is a trademark of ADM, was invented by William T. Atkinson in the 1950s and 1960s,” says Schuh. Atkinson developed a process to “texturize” soy flour into a meat-like substance using an extruder with mechanical shear and heat, combined with the injection of water. “The original TVP was a fibrous, spongy material used as a stand-alone meat alternative product, as well a nutritional extender in meat and poultry products to reduce costs and increase protein content.”\nWhile soy is still one of the most common alternative protein sources for plant based meat, like the Impossible Burger, its presence as one of the ‘big eight’ allergens make it difficult for some consumers to purchase and eat these products, leading to a rise in popularity for pea protein alternatives.\n"},"resolution":null}}}}

See the tournament page for details.\nUS farmers received roughly $10B in subisides in 2020, according data from EWG's Farm Subsidy Database. A majority of this is spent on commodity subsidies, which subsidise the production of crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans, and rice.\nAs many subsidized crops are inputs to intensive animal farming, these often serve as implicit subsidies to the industry (Starmer, 2006). In addition, livestock production is commonly directly subsidized. In 2020, livestock producers received direct subsidies amounting to roughly $330M, according to EWG data. Subsidies for incumbent intensive animal protein production inhibit the rate at which such approaches can be substituted by cleaner alternative proteins (Jiang et al., 2020).\n"},"resolution":null}}}}
