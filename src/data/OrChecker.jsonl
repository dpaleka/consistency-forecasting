In the event of a dispute over the election results, the question will resolve based on the final decision by the relevant legal authority, such as the Supreme Court of the United States, if applicable. If a woman assumes the presidency through succession, impeachment, or any other means other than being elected and inaugurated for a new term within the specified timeframe, this will not satisfy the resolution criteria.\n\nIn the case that the inauguration date is officially changed, the resolution timeframe will be adjusted accordingly. If no woman is inaugurated as President during the specified timeframe, the question will resolve as No.\n\n","resolution_date":"2031-01-20T00:00:00","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"Q":{"id":"25ff8795-e163-48ad-8b0a-cad04afebc0e","title":"What is the probability that France's Gross Domestic Product will increase by more than 3% annually between 2024 and 2030?","body":"Resolution criteria: This question will resolve as Yes if the annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of France, as reported by the World Bank or the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), increases by more than 3% per annum for each year between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2030. The GDP growth rate is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year. The growth rate must be positive and exceed 3% for each individual year within the specified period, without rounding. If the World Bank or INSEE revises their figures after the initial publication, the most recent revision available by the resolution date will be used to determine the outcome. In the event that the World Bank and INSEE report different figures, the average of the two will be used. If either the World Bank or INSEE ceases to report France's GDP growth rate, or if their reporting is delayed past the resolution date, the next most authoritative source, as determined by the question author, will be used. If no authoritative source is available by the resolution date, the question will resolve as N/A (not applicable).\n\nIn the case of extraordinary circumstances that significantly disrupt the ability to measure GDP accurately (e.g., major economic reforms, changes in statistical methodology, or data reporting standards), a fallback scenario will involve a panel of three economic experts, chosen in good faith by the question author, to estimate the GDP growth rate based on available data and expert judgment. Their majority opinion will be used to resolve the question.\n\n","resolution_date":"2031-01-31T00:00:00","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic_inst","url":null,"metadata":null,"resolution":null},"P_or_Q":{"id":"f65db0f3-4d5d-4929-b1e2-24fc1a3126fb","title":"Will either of the following occur: (a) a woman is elected as the President of the United States between 2024 and 2030, or (b) France's Gross Domestic Product increases by more than 3% annually between 2024 and 2030?","body":"Resolves YES if either of the specified events occur (or both).
