'Significant enhancement' is defined as a measurable increase in the availability, accuracy, and verifiability of data related to carbon emissions, carbon offset projects, and carbon credit transactions. This must be evidenced by a comparative study or report from a recognized authority in the field of climatology or environmental policy, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The study should demonstrate improvements in transparency compared to the state of climatology data as of January 1, 2020. In the absence of a definitive report, a consensus among experts in the field, as reflected in peer-reviewed publications, may also be considered sufficient for resolution. Edge cases, such as partial adoption without significant data enhancement or improvements in transparency that are not attributable to blockchain technology, will not meet the resolution criteria.", "resolution_date": "2030-12-31 23:59:59+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic", "url": null, "metadata": {"tags": "Climatology", "category": "Cryptocurrencies"}, "resolution": null}
