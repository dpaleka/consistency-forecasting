Biocontainment technologies using hydroponic systems refer to the use of soil-less plant growing systems to contain, eliminate, or manage infectious agents in a way that prevents their spread or treats infected individuals. The development must be confirmed by an official announcement from a recognized government body, research institution, or corporation involved in the project. In the absence of an official announcement, credible reports from at least three major news organizations (BBC, The Guardian, New York Times, Washington Post, Reuters) are sufficient. The technology must be beyond the conceptual phase, with physical prototypes or active development projects underway. Technologies developed for other purposes but repurposed for biocontainment in response to a new infectious disease also qualify, provided the repurposing is officially announced or reported as specified above.","resolution_date":"2029-12-31T00:00:00Z","question_type":"binary","data_source":"synthetic","created_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00","url":null,"metadata":{"generated_from_ref_class_spanner":true,"original_question":{"id":"68dae53f-77b2-4d9f-939e-155dc4a6a6f3","title":"Will a new infectious disease prompt the development of nuclear biocontainment technologies before 2030?","body":"This question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2030, the development of nuclear biocontainment technologies is initiated in response to a new infectious disease.
