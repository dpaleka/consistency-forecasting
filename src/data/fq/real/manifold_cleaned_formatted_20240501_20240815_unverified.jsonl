The BfV report said they were all from Central Asia and had entered Germany from Ukraine at the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of its western neighbour.\n\nThey had, it said, planned attacks and had already identified and scouted out potential targets and made attempts to procure weapons.\n\nEarlier this month, police and prosecutors arrested a German-Moroccan-Polish national, identified only at Soufian T, who is suspected of transferring $1,675 in cryptocurrency to an Isis-K account.\n\nDer Spiegel reported that he had tried to get a job as a steward in one of the public
