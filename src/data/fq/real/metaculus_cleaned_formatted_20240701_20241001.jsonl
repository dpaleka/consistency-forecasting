In addition, we will not grant new coal licences and will ban fracking for good.\n\nFurthermore, Labour also pledged that they:\n\n>will not revoke existing licences and we will partner with business and workers to manage our existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan. \n\nHowever, the Financial Times [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/af2c1ba0-4ca3-436f-960a-f223619e6a22) that - contrary to their manifesto - the Labour Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is expected to ban new drilling licenses:\n\n>The government is expected to ban new North Sea drilling licences from companies whose applications are already being processed\n\n>Energy secretary Ed Miliband is considering blocking a handful of outstanding applications made as part of an oil and gas licensing round that opened in late 2022\n\nThe article elaborates further:\n\n>The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero denied a report published earlier on Thursday by the Daily Telegraph that Miliband had already over-ruled his officials and ordered an \u201cimmediate ban on new drilling\u201d that would stop the final applications in the 33rd round.\u00a0\n\n>Yet the government did not deny that Miliband\u2019s eventual intention was to stop those licence applications from being granted by the North Sea Transition Authority. Ministers are considering the situation carefully before making any firm decision, according to government figures.\u00a0\n\nAccording to [Energy Voice](https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/exploration-production/552821/breaking-nsta-reveals-winners-of-latest-north-sea-licensing-round/), the 33rd licensing round resulted in 27 licenses being awarded in the first tranche, 24 in the second, and a further 31 in the third, with the latter tranche potentially adding 600 million barrels of oil equivalent.\n\n*Will Labour revoke any North Sea oil and gas licenses currently being processed?*"}, "resolution": null}
