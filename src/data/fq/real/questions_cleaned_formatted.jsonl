Musk summarily affirmed that estimate.\nLike most of Musk's predictions, this timeline seems too ambitious to be realized. Corrected to Musk Years, a million-Martian population is more likely to exist by spring of 2074. My question is simple: Will it? More specifically, Will the population of living, biological humans residing on Mars be greater than or equal to one million before 2075-01-01?\nSome specifics:\nHumans born on Mars or born en route to Mars (if that's even possible within the prediction window) do count towards the total (though it seems unlikely this is a major source of population growth in Musk's model).\nHumans who die on Mars or en route to Mars prior to the closing date do not count towards the total.\nHumans who leave Mars do not count towards the total, unless they return to Mars prior to the resolution date.\nThis should be resolved according to a credible estimate by any institution suited to evaluate the population sizes of Martian colonies. Some possible such institutions are: the government(s) of any Martian colony(s), SpaceX or any other corporate entities with commercial ventures to/on Mars, any concerned political institutions such as the United Nations or the World Health Organization, any non-government organization with an interest in the demography of Mars.\nSuch entities must estimate the size of the Martian population prior to Earth Year 2075 C.E. Stated differently, population estimates capable of resolving this question may be published in or after 2075, so long as the population estimates are given for 2074 (or earlier, if the one million threshold is met earlier).\nAny credible estimate of a Martian population in excess of one million humans prior to the end of 2074 will cause this question to retroactively close one year prior to the estimate's publication date.\n", "resolution_date": "2075-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "metaculus", "url": "https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3519", "metadata": {"topics": [{"id": 184, "slug": "elon-musk", "name": "Elon Musk", "link_id": 10490, "num_questions": 159}, {"id": 485, "slug": "spacex-reusable-launch-system-development-program", "name": "SpaceX reusable launch system", "link_id": 10492, "num_questions": 130}, {"id": 1365, "slug": "spacex", "name": "SpaceX", "link_id": 74943, "num_questions": 112}, {"id": 88, "slug": "united-nations", "name": "United Nations", "link_id": 10489, "num_questions": 86}, {"id": 564, "slug": "colonization-of-mars", "name": "Colonization of Mars", "link_id": 10493, "num_questions": 70}, {"id": 716, "slug": "spacex-starship", "name": "SpaceX Starship", "link_id": 10494, "num_questions": 65}], "background_info": ""}, "resolution": null}

As of the writing of this question, Tesla is losing money and selling significantly less cars than even the 20th largest auto-company in the world. Yet, the expectations that have been set for Tesla by Elon Musk would probably require Tesla to sell more cars than any other company on the planet while maintaining large profit-margins.\nIn order to ramp-up production from approx. 100,000 to 500,000 or 1,000,000 cars a year, Tesla has created the Model 3, its first mass market car. Regrettably, Tesla has had trouble producing the Model 3 and production of the car can be tracked here. It is likely that Tesla's total vehicle production must exceed 10 million in order for it to become the world's largest car company. Yet, given its financial situation, there is a risk that the company goes bankrupt before that happens."}, "resolution": null}
