Many experts now believe there is a significant chance that a machine superintelligence – a system that can outperform humans at all relevant intelligence tasks – will be developed within the next century, and possibly much sooner.\nIn a 2017 survey of artificial intelligence experts, the median expert estimated that there is a 50% chance of human-level artificial intelligence by 2062, and after this milestone were reached, respondents reported a 10% chance that superintelligence would be achieved within two years. Our very own question on the prospect of human-machine intelligence parity by 2040 currently has a median prediction of 60%. In another question on the possibility of progress toward human-machine intelligence parity surprising us, a similar median estimate is given.\nShow More'}, 'resolution': None}, 'Q': {'id': 'e691b38e-d5dc-430d-9d6a-e487c5f1b9fb', 'title': 'Will the USD be the dominant global reserve currency in 2050?', 'body': "The question will resolve as Yes if, as of January 1, 2050, the United States Dollar (USD) is the most held currency in official foreign exchange reserves according to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) report.

If there is uncertainty about the research activities, a moderator may verify with MIRI directly. If MIRI undergoes a name change or merges with another entity, the new or merged organization will be considered for resolution as if no change occurred. In disputes over resolution criteria, changes can be made if agreed upon by at least one moderator and admin. In case of admin disagreements, a community vote will decide. If MIRI's research is only shared internally, the requirement for 'standard academic publication formats' will not be necessary."}

Prompt: {"title":"Will the USD be the dominant global reserve currency in 2050 or will a global catastrophe be due to an artificial intelligence failure-mode?","body":"The question will resolve as Yes if any of the following conditions are met: a.) As of January 1, 2050, the United States Dollar (USD) is the most held currency in official foreign exchange reserves according to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) report. Dominance is defined as the USD comprising the largest percentage of declared reserves compared to any other individual currency. In the event that the IMF no longer provides this report, a comparable authoritative source will be used to determine the outcome. If no such source is available, the question will resolve as ambiguous. Edge cases, such as the emergence of a new global currency that is a direct successor to the USD, will be considered as a continuation of USD dominance. However, if the USD is replaced or substantially reformed in a manner that changes its fundamental nature (e.g., becoming a cryptocurrency), the question will resolve as No. OR b.) A catastrophe occurs resulting principally from the deployment of some artificial intelligence system(s) that claims at least 10% of the human population in any period of 5 years or less before 2100. It resolves No if this occurs for non-AI reasons, and Annulled if no global catastrophe occurs. Years are here defined as consecutive calendar years."}

Indium is threatened too, says Armin Reller, a materials chemist at Germany’s University of Augsburg. He estimates that our planet’s stock of indium will last no more than another decade. All the hafnium will be gone by 2017 also, and another twenty years will see the extinction of zinc. Even copper is an endangered item, since worldwide demand for it is likely to exceed available supplies by the end of the present century.\n\nResolution Criteria for the second part:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the following conditions are met before January 1, 2040:\n- A digital system successfully emulates the human brain with a level of intelligence comparable to that of an average human, as confirmed by a panel of neuroscientists and AI experts.\n- The emulation demonstrates capabilities such as learning, memory, reasoning, and creativity at a level equivalent to or surpassing human performance in a variety of tasks.\n- The emulation is capable of passing a series of standardized cognitive tests designed to evaluate human-level intelligence.\n- The achievement is widely recognized and accepted by the scientific community and leading experts in the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe resolution will not consider partial or incomplete emulations that do not meet the specified criteria, and the emulation must demonstrate sustained performance over an extended period to be considered successful.\n\nResolution Criteria for the third part:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the State of Israel is formally recognized by the government of Iran at any time between January 1, 2021 to January 1, 2070.\n\nThe question resolves YES if all three parts are met, and NO otherwise."}
Preface: You are an informed and well-calibrated forecaster. I need you to give me your best probability estimate for the following sentence or question resolving YES. Your answer should be a float between 0 and 1, with nothing else in your response.
