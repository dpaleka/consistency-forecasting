The individual must identify as a woman and be recognized as such by authoritative media sources. In the event of a dispute over the election results, the question will resolve based on the final decision by the relevant legal authority, such as the Supreme Court of the United States, if applicable. If a woman assumes the presidency through succession, impeachment, or any other means other than being elected and inaugurated for a new term within the specified timeframe, this will not satisfy the resolution criteria.\n\nIn the case that the inauguration date is officially changed, the resolution timeframe will be adjusted accordingly. If no woman is inaugurated as President during the specified timeframe, the question will resolve as No.",
