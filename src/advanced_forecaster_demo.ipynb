      "[1] SpaceX has added a 'human spaceflight' portion to its web site (published on 2024-05-06)\n",
      "Summary: SpaceX has added human spaceflight offerings to its website, including missions to Earth orbit, the International Space Station (ISS), lunar orbit, and Mars. The company's Starship upper stage is one of the vehicles listed for these missions. Pricing information is not available, but interested customers can inquire via email. Missions to Earth orbit will begin later this year, with seats and research opportunities available in late 2024. Ten-day commercial missions to the ISS will be available in 2025. Trips to lunar orbit and Mars do not have listed timelines. SpaceX's ambitious plan suggests the possibility of landing people on Mars before 2030.\n",

      "Summary: SpaceX is gearing up for the highly anticipated fourth flight test of its Starship spacecraft at Boca Chica, Texas. The site has been a hive of activity, with engineers and technicians working tirelessly to ensure every component functions seamlessly. The innovative updates and rigorous testing regimens could redefine space travel, setting new standards for safety, efficiency, and technological integration. The upcoming flight test is crucial for validating the design changes and new technologies integrated into the spacecraft and its support systems. If successful, this could pave the way for SpaceX to land people on Mars before 2030, as outlined in their detailed plan for interplanetary travel.\n",

      "Summary: NASA says SpaceX is on track to demonstrate in-space refueling of Starship next year, a critical technology for returning humans to the lunar surface. The next major milestone is a demonstration planned for 2025 where two Starships will dock in orbit, with one transferring propellants to the other. Propellant transfer technology is essential to SpaceX’s plans for Starship missions beyond low Earth orbit, including the Human Landing System (HLS) version of Starship that will be used to land astronauts on the moon starting with the Artemis 3 mission, currently scheduled for no earlier than September 2026. Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, posted on social media that \"Full & rapid reusability of booster & ship and orbital refilling of ship are the 2 fundamental technologies we aim to solve by the end of next year.\"\n",
