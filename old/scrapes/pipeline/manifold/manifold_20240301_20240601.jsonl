Kennedy, before his death the previous year of brain cancer.\n\nSeveral doctors noticed a dark spot on the younger Mr. Kennedy\u2019s brain scans and concluded that he had a tumor, he said in a 2012 deposition reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Kennedy was immediately scheduled for a procedure at Duke University Medical Center by the same surgeon who had\u00a0operated on his uncle, he said.\n\nWhile packing for the trip, he said, he received a call from a doctor at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who had a different opinion: Mr. Kennedy, he believed, had a dead parasite in his head.\n\nThe doctor believed that the abnormality seen on his scans \u201cwas caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said in the deposition.\n\nDoctors ultimately concluded that the cyst they saw on scans contained the remains of a parasite.
