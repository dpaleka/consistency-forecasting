As used in this subsection, the term \u201coffice\u201d does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.\nIn early August 2022, federal agents executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, the primary residence of Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States, in the course of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there. It has been speculated that Trump may eventually be charged with a crime in relation to these documents, potentially including an offense under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2071.\nAccording to Reuters:\nWhile the Presidential Records Act does not specify an enforcement mechanism, taking presidential records from the White House could open Trump up to charges of conspiring to impede the proper functioning of the National Archives, said Jeffrey Cohen, an associate professor at Boston College Law School and former federal prosecutor.\nHe could also be charged under a law, known by its code number 2071, making it a crime to conceal or destroy U.S. public documents, or laws making it illegal to steal or damage government property.\n...\nA provision of 2071 states that anyone convicted will be barred from holding federal office and face a prison term of up to three years.\nHowever, Reuters also notes:\nBut experts said that provision may not be constitutional. The U.S. Constitution sets forth the qualifications for holding federal elected office, and previous Supreme Court rulings have held that Congress cannot limit who can run for the presidency, the Senate or the House.\nIf convicted and disqualified from office, Trump would likely challenge it in court, where the outcome would be far from certain.\nAnother Metaculus question, 'Will any US court rule that Donald J. Trump is disqualified from holding the presidency before January 20th 2025?,' asks whether Trump will be disqualified from the presidency before inauguration day in 2025. This question asks, contingent on that happening, whether that disqualification will subsequently be ruled unconstitutional prior to inauguration day in 2025.\n"}, "resolution": true}

As of December 1, 2023, the CDC shows four variant classifications which describe the characteristics of certain variants for use in informing the public health response. The four classifications are described as follows:\nVariants Being Monitored (VBM)\n. . . Variants designated as VBM include:\nlineages with potential impact on available medical countermeasures based on analysis of genetic sequence data.\nlineages that previously caused more severe disease or increased transmission but that are no longer detected.\nlineage with an unusually large number of antigenic mutations AND presence in multiple countries with collection dates within 4 weeks. *lineages previously designated as a VOI, VOC, or VOHC that are currently circulating at very low levels in the United States.\nA Variant of Interest or a Variant of Concern may be downgraded to this list after it is no longer circulating at sustained levels and no longer poses significant risk to public health in the United States. Classifications may change over time, based on the evolving situation and information available.\nVariant of Interest (VOI)\n. . . Variants designated as VOI include variants that have:\nreduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination.\nreduced efficacy of FDA approved treatments, or diagnostic tests.\npredicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.\nPossible attributes of a Variant of Interest include:\nspecific genetic markers that are predicted to affect transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape.\nevidence that it is the cause of an increased proportion of cases or unique outbreak clusters.\nVariant of Concern (VOC)\n. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of interest, variants designated as VOC include:\nincrease in transmissibility.\nmore severe disease (for example, increased hospitalizations or deaths).\nsignificant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.\nreduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.\nVariant of High Consequence (VOHC)\nA VOHC has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of concern, variants designated as VOHC include impact on MCMs such as:\ndemonstrated failure of diagnostic test targets.\nevidence to suggest a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness, a disproportionately high number of infections in vaccinated persons, or very low vaccine-induced protection against severe disease.\nsignificantly reduced susceptibility to multiple EUA or approved therapeutics.\nmore severe clinical disease and increased hospitalizations.\nThe variant class hierarchy is described by the CDC as follows:\nEach variant classification includes the possible attributes of lower classes (for example, VOC includes the possible attributes of VOI). . . U.S. classifications may differ from the WHO classifications because the impact of variants may differ by location.\nAs of December 1, 2023, only \"Omicron (parent lineages)\" is classified as a VOC. All other variants are classified as VBM, except for \"variants containing the F456L spike mutations\" which is classified as a VOI. Previously the only variants to have reached the level of VOC were Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron, though all but \"Omicron (parent lineages)\" have since been downgraded.\n"}, "resolution": false}
