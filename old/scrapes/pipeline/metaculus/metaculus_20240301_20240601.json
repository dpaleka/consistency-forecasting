            "background_info": "Various criminal offenses against the United States include as a potential penalty legal disqualification from holding federal office, theoretically including the presidency of the United States.\n\nThese offenses include (inter alia) those under [18 U.S. Code § 2071](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2071), which states:\n\n>(a)Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n\n>(b)Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nIn early August 2022, federal agents executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago,  the primary residence of Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States, in the course of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there. It has been speculated that Trump may eventually be charged with a crime in relation to these documents, potentially including an offense under 18 U.S. Code § 2071. \n\nAccording to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/what-charges-might-trump-face-removing-white-house-records-2022-08-10/):\n\n>While the Presidential Records Act does not specify an enforcement mechanism, taking presidential records from the White House could open Trump up to charges of conspiring to impede the proper functioning of the National Archives, said Jeffrey Cohen, an associate professor at Boston College Law School and former federal prosecutor.\n\n>He could also be charged under a law, known by its code number 2071, making it a crime to conceal or destroy U.S. public documents, or laws making it illegal to steal or damage government property.\n\n>...\n\n>A provision of 2071 states that anyone convicted will be barred from holding federal office and face a prison term of up to three years.\n\nHowever, Reuters also notes:\n\n\n>But experts said that provision may not be constitutional. The U.S. Constitution sets forth the qualifications for holding federal elected office, and previous Supreme Court rulings have held that Congress cannot limit who can run for the presidency, the Senate or the House.\n\n>If convicted and disqualified from office, Trump would likely challenge it in court, where the outcome would be far from certain.\n\nAnother Metaculus question, '[Will any US court rule that Donald J. Trump is disqualified from holding the presidency before January 20th 2025?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12214/d-j-trump-disqualified-before-jan-20-2025/),' asks whether Trump will be disqualified from the presidency before inauguration day in 2025. This question asks, contingent on that happening, whether that disqualification will subsequently be ruled unconstitutional prior to inauguration day in 2025."

The next election is scheduled for [Thursday 2 May 2024](https://www.london.gov.uk/who-we-are/governance-and-spending/good-governance/electing-mayor-and-assembly).\n\nSadiq Khan has been the mayor of London since 2016, and will run for re-election in 2024. As the incumbent mayor, he will be seeking to continue serving in the role. In late 2022, he said that [“still very much [his] intention to run and win a third term](https://www.cityam.com/khan-says-it-is-my-intention-to-run-and-win-third-term-as-london-mayor/). \n\nAccording to [smarkets.com](https://smarkets.com/event/42282035/politics/uk/london-mayoral-election/2024-london-mayoral-election-winner), the top three follow-up candidates for 2024 London mayoral election winner after Sadiq Khan are Jeremy Corbyn, Dawn Butler, and David Lammy. \n\nPreviously, London mayoral elections used the supplementary vote system. The supplementary vote system is a method of conducting elections in which voters are allowed to cast two votes for a single office. The first vote is for their preferred candidate, and the second vote is for their second choice. If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first-choice votes, they are declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the two candidates with the most first-choice votes move on to a second round of voting. In this round, only the second-choice votes of voters who selected one of the two remaining candidates as their first choice are counted. The candidate with the most votes in the second round is declared the winner. \n\nHowever, for the 2024 mayoral election, based on the Elections Act 2022, the election will be conducted under the [first-past-the-post system.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-past-the-post-to-be-introduced-for-all-local-mayoral-and-police-and-crime-commissioner-elections) Under this system, each voter gets to cast a ballot for their preferred candidate, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins the election. This means that the winner may not necessarily have received a majority of the votes, but rather just more votes than any other individual candidate.\n\nIn the last election, [no candidate received more than 50% of the vote]( https://www.londonelects.org.uk/im-voter/election-results/results-2021-elections/results-factsheet-2021):\n\n>Had a candidate received more than 50 per cent of the total good first choice votes, they would have been elected without considering second choice votes. No candidate did so. The candidate with the highest number of first choice votes, Sadiq Khan, gained 40 per cent of the total first choice votes for all candidates (1,013,721 as a percentage of 2,531,357).\n\nSo far, all London mayors (Livingstone, Johnson, and Khan) have served two terms only. If Sadiq Khan wins the re-election, that would make him the [first mayor of London to have won three terms.](https://www.onlondon.co.uk/labour-candidate-selection-trigger-ballot-for-2024-mayoral-race-gets-underway/)"

The election resulted in a hung Congress of Deputies; center-right PP is the biggest party, but its 136 seats are far short of the 176 needed for a majority in the 350-strong chamber.\n\nRunners-up were the PSOE, PP's center-left rival, with a surprising 122 seats - a gain of two compared to projected losses based on pre-election polls. Next come right-wing Vox and left-wing Sumar, with 33 and 31 seats respectively. The balance, 28 seats, is accounted for by seven regionalist parties of various affiliations in the left-right spectrum.\n\nThis suggests coalition talks might prove difficult. The only possible two-party majority would be a PP-PSOE government, but such a German-style \"grand coalition\" is unheard of in the Spanish political tradition. Junts, a Catalan independentist party that holds seven seats and is seen as \"big tent\" in the left-right spectrum, is seen as kingmakers; however, their main platform plank of Catalan independence is strongly opposed by both major parties.\n\nAfter decades of parliaments lasting for most of their terms, Spain has in recent years seen two elections, in December 2015 and April 2019, fail to produce lasting governments. These ballots were succeeded by others in June 2016 and November 2019, both of which resulted in longer-lasting Cortes.\n\nIn this scenario, the question arises: will Spain call another election soon?"

            "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 4, 2024, [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) report that Macky Sall has stepped down from the office of president of Senegal.",
            "background_info": "Senegal was [scheduled to hold presidential elections on February 25, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Senegalese_presidential_election), but on February 5 Senegalese President [Macky Sall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macky_Sall) announced that the elections would be [delayed until December](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/05/africa/senegal-parliament-debates-extending-presidents-mandate-intl/index.html). The delayed vote has led to [protests and unrest](https://news.yahoo.com/ahead-planned-march-over-vote-122105603.html), as well as a state crackdown against the protests.\n\nSall's term is scheduled to end on April 2, 2024, and the delayed elections have [led to uncertainty regarding whether Sall will respect the term limit](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68253255).\n\nSenegal is in the geographical region of Africa that has seen a high rate of coups the past three years. Despite this, Senegal had previously maintained some stability and helped coordinate responses against coups elsewhere in the region.\n\nYet when Sall was [interviewed by *The Economist*](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/26/senegals-president-asks-if-democracy-can-work-in-africas-coup-belt) in October 2023 he asked,\n\n> \"Is democracy as we want to do it really suitable?\"\n\nPreviously there had been a damaging fight between the incumbent president and an opposition leader, Ousmane Sonko. The Economist wrote,\n\n> The fight centres around the question of whether Senegal’s government is trying to tilt the election by using the courts to keep Mr Sonko off the ballot.\n\nThis has involved accusations of rape (acquitted), corruption of youth (convicted), plotting an insurrection (still active). The opposition claims this is repeating a pattern from 2019 when the opposition was also barred from running due to criminal convictions. The incumbent president denies this.\n\n> The charge and conviction sparked large protests, some of them violent, in support of Mr Sonko. The demonstrations were also fuelled by hints from Mr Sall that he might try to run for a third presidential term, even though Senegal’s constitution has a two-term limit. It was only in July that Mr Sall definitively said he would not seek office again, after more than two years of protests and at least 37 deaths, according to Amnesty International, a rights group.\n\n> Mr Sall’s announcement led to a lull in the violence, though it lasted less than a month until Mr Sonko was once more arrested. The government also dissolved his political party, Pastef, and arrested many of its leaders, including several mayors. As protests flared, the government cut mobile-internet access for almost a week.\n\nThere seems to be insecurities around how peaceful Senegal's democracy really is:\n\n> Many fear more violence before the election, especially if Mr Sonko is definitively barred from running. Even Mr Sall prevaricates when asked if he expects the election to be peaceful. [...] Mr Sall bristles at the suggestion there has been a backsliding of democracy on his watch. “Those who say that [there has been] are supporters of anarchy and chaos,” he retorts. “Senegal has no lessons in democracy to learn from anyone.”"

This change represents a significant shift in the company's structure and governance. Public companies, like Twitter was previously, are subject to strict disclosure requirements and shareholder scrutiny, with their shares traded on public stock exchanges. In contrast, a private company like Twitter under Musk's ownership is not obligated to disclose as much information and its shares are not publicly traded. This transition to a private structure grants Musk more control over the company's operations and strategic direction, allowing for potentially more rapid and significant changes in policies and practices.

Variants designated as VOI include variants that have:\n>\n>* reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination.\n>* reduced efficacy of FDA approved treatments, or diagnostic tests.\n>* predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.\n>\n>Possible attributes of a Variant of Interest include:\n>\n>* specific genetic markers that are predicted to affect transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape.\n>* evidence that it is the cause of an increased proportion of cases or unique outbreak clusters.\n\n**Variant of Concern (VOC)**\n>. . .

In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of concern, variants designated as VOHC include impact on MCMs such as:\n>\n>* demonstrated failure of diagnostic test targets.\n>* evidence to suggest a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness, a disproportionately high number of infections in vaccinated persons, or very low vaccine-induced protection against severe disease.\n>* significantly reduced susceptibility to multiple EUA or approved therapeutics.\n>* more severe clinical disease and increased hospitalizations.\n\nThe variant class hierarchy is described by the CDC as follows:\n\n>Each variant classification includes the possible attributes of lower classes (for example, VOC includes the possible attributes of VOI). . . U.S. classifications may differ from the WHO classifications because the impact of variants may differ by location.\n\nAs of December 1, 2023, only \"Omicron (parent lineages)\" is classified as a VOC. All other variants are classified as VBM, except for \"variants containing the F456L spike mutations\" which is classified as a VOI.

If either of the top 2 placed finishers have already qualified through the two proceeding paths, the next highest-placed finisher at the Grand Swiss will qualify instead.\n- 1 Spot goes to the highest place finisher of the [2023-2024 FIDE Circuit](https://wcc.fide.com/fide_circuit.phtml) who hasn't already qualified through the proceedings paths (i.e. even though Fabiano Caruana is guaranteed to finish first in the circuit, he qualified through the World Cup path, and so the second place player from the circuit will likely qualify instead, unless the happen to finish in the top 2 of the Grande Swiss). \n- 1 Spot to the top rated player in the [FIDE rankings](https://ratings.fide.com/top_lists.phtml?list=open) who hasn't qualified through any of the other paths, provided the player has played at least 4 classical time control tournaments eligible for the 2023 FIDE Circuit."

However, similar threats were previously raised in late [December](https://www.memri.org/jttm/veiled-threat-telegram-channels-linked-houthi-ansar-allah-movement-point-submarine-internet), but have not brought significant attention due to a focus on the dangers to international shipping.\n\nWhile these cables are supposed to be unreachable without high-tech equipment such as advanced submarines, in some places the sea floor is only a depth of around [100 metres](https://www.airforce-technology.com/features/could-the-houthis-sabotage-international-internet-cables-in-the-red-sea/?cf-view). Such locations might therefore allow a potential saboteur to reach the cables even without equipment."

The most recent [visit](https://balkaninsight.com/2024/04/10/moldovas-restive-gagauzia-region-mulls-using-russian-payment-cards/) occurred on the 8th of April, and before that on the 6th of March, during which she [met](https://balkaninsight.com/2024/03/07/pro-moscow-governor-of-moldovas-gagauzia-seeks-putins-help/) with Russian President Vladimir Putin (edit May 6, 2024: Guțul also appears to have been in Moscow when this question was launched, with a [meeting in Moscow on April 22](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moldova-brings-criminal-case-against-pro-russian-gagauzia-leader-court-2024-04-24/) and on [April 24](https://twitter.com/EvgheniaGutul/status/1783236723297685785)).\n\nIn the aftermath of both visits Russia promised to \"protect\" Gagauzia and also to distribute monthly [payments](https://cepa.org/article/the-kremlin-decides-to-buy-a-population/) to Gagauzian civil servants and senior citizens (together accounting for approximately 25,000 people).\n\nMore Guțul visits in Russia might signal rapid development in this region, which could mean further deterioration of the relationship between Gagauzia and Moldovan government."

He was following a plan approved by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to “minimise” Russia’s naval presence in the Black Sea.\n\nOn April 26, 2024, [Newsweek reported](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-decoy-missiles-crimea-bridge-attack-rybar-1894639) that an attack could coincide with Russian President Vladimir Putin's [May 7 inauguration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Russian_presidential_election#:~:text=He%20is%20scheduled%20to%20be%20inaugurated%20on%207%20May%202024.):\n\n>[Telegram channel] Rybar said an attack on the Kerch Bridge could happen before the inauguration of Putin on May 7.

Otherwise the question will resolve as **No**.",
            "background_info": "Elon Musk is the current CEO of Tesla and owns around 13% of the company. During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\n\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1):\n\n>Tesla’s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla’s incorporation to Texas.\n\n>Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as “crap”.\n\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular,  Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\n\n- Purchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\n\n - Purchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\n\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm):\n\n>A proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\n\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has [advised](https://www.ft.com/content/8d823cef-543a-4d33-afa0-c68f081842d1) shareholders *not* to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\n\n---------------------\n\nSee related question:\n\n[*Will a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?*](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/21972/non-disney-board-member-elected-april-2024/)"
