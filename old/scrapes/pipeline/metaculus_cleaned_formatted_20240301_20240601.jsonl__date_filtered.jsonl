As used in this subsection, the term \u201coffice\u201d does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nIn early August 2022, federal agents executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago,  the primary residence of Donald J.

The supplementary vote system is a method of conducting elections in which voters are allowed to cast two votes for a single office. The first vote is for their preferred candidate, and the second vote is for their second choice. If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first-choice votes, they are declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the two candidates with the most first-choice votes move on to a second round of voting. In this round, only the second-choice votes of voters who selected one of the two remaining candidates as their first choice are counted. The candidate with the most votes in the second round is declared the winner. \n\nHowever, for the 2024 mayoral election, based on the Elections Act 2022, the election will be conducted under the [first-past-the-post system.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-past-the-post-to-be-introduced-for-all-local-mayoral-and-police-and-crime-commissioner-elections) Under this system, each voter gets to cast a ballot for their preferred candidate, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins the election. This means that the winner may not necessarily have received a majority of the votes, but rather just more votes than any other individual candidate.\n\nIn the last election, [no candidate received more than 50% of the vote]( https://www.londonelects.org.uk/im-voter/election-results/results-2021-elections/results-factsheet-2021):\n\n>Had a candidate received more than 50 per cent of the total good first choice votes, they would have been elected without considering second choice votes. No candidate did so. The candidate with the highest number of first choice votes, Sadiq Khan, gained 40 per cent of the total first choice votes for all candidates (1,013,721 as a percentage of 2,531,357).\n\nSo far, all London mayors (Livingstone, Johnson, and Khan) have served two terms only. If Sadiq Khan wins the re-election, that would make him the [first mayor of London to have won three terms.](https://www.onlondon.co.uk/labour-candidate-selection-trigger-ballot-for-2024-mayoral-race-gets-underway/)"}, "resolution": true}
