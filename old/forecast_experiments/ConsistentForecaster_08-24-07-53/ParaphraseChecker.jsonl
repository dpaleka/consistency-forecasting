Since the Cold War's conclusion, this number has significantly declined. According to Kristensen and Korda (2019), the current operational stockpile of the US stands at nearly 3,800 warheads. The estimated breakdown includes:\n1,750 warheads currently deployed, comprising\n1,300 strategic warheads mounted on ballistic missiles,\n300 stationed at strategic bomber bases in the US,\n150 tactical bombs located at air bases in Europe.\nAdditionally, there are 2,050 warheads set aside as a precaution against technical or geopolitical uncertainties.\nThis decreasing trend could be altered if nuclear rearmament occurs, particularly with escalating global tensions. The Nuclear Posture Review from the Trump Administration takes a more aggressive stance, emphasizing \"Great Power competition\" and suggesting a potential increase in the US nuclear arsenal.\nWill the US have 3,800 or fewer nuclear warheads by 2029?\nA positive answer to this question will be given if reliable sources, like the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' Nuclear Notebook (similar to the 2019 edition), confirm that the US had 3,800 (or fewer) nuclear warheads at any point during 2029. If the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists stops its operations or publications, another credible source may be used. For resolution purposes, warheads that have been retired and are waiting for dismantlement will not be included.\nSee the related question: If the US refrains from nuclear disarmament, what will be the overall number of nuclear warheads it holds in 2029?", "resolution_date": "2029-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic_inst", "url": null, "metadata": null, "resolution": null, "elicited_prob": 0.5}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}
