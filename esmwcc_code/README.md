This folder contains some relevant code from the Evaluating Superhuman Models with Consistency Checks paper.
It's probably not useful to run these (our data format is different, the OpenAI API is different),
but feel free to borrow any part of the code if needed. `violation.py` may be particularly useful for our purposes.
