# Pull Request Update

## Changes Made
- Implemented the "Show Examples" functionality in the Streamlit application.
- Added actual examples for each feedback category that are displayed when the "Show Examples" checkbox is checked.
- Ensured that the examples are relevant and provide clear guidance on how to provide feedback.

## Testing
- The functionality was tested locally by running the Streamlit application and verifying that the examples are displayed correctly when the "Show Examples" checkbox is checked.
- A screenshot was taken to confirm the correct display of examples.

## Notes
- The examples are hardcoded into the conditional logic that checks if the 'show_examples' checkbox is checked.
- When the checkbox is checked, the examples corresponding to each feedback category are displayed as intended.

This update aims to enhance the user experience by providing clear examples for feedback submission, making the feedback process more intuitive and efficient.

Please review the changes and provide your feedback.
