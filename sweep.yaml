description: 'This project focuses on performing consistency checks for forecasting by generating and evaluating probability distributions over future events. It aims to develop a suite of tests and datasets to assess the consistency of AI models such as GPT-4 in making forecasts. Key components include creating a dataset of base and synthetic questions, generating consistency checks from these questions, and developing a method for semi-automatically verifying the validity of these checks. The project involves extensive interaction with large language models (LLMs) through a dedicated utility module (src/common/llm_utils.py) and employs a specialized Forecaster class for handling probability queries. The evaluation procedure is designed to be modular, allowing for separate phases of data preparation and consistency evaluation with various forecasters.'
