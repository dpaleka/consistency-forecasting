**Response to Issue #24: Asynchronous Nature of `format_questions.py`**

After a thorough review of the `format_questions.py` file and related functions within the `consistency-forecasting` codebase, I would like to provide some insights into the asynchronous design of the file.

The `format_questions.py` script includes asynchronous functions such as `validate_and_format_question` and `process_questions_from_file`, which are designed to handle multiple forecasting questions concurrently. This asynchronous processing is particularly beneficial for I/O-bound tasks, such as reading from or writing to files, where the operations can be performed in parallel without blocking the event loop. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with a large number of questions.

The script utilizes the `asyncio` library to create an event loop and `aiofiles` for asynchronous file operations, indicating that the asynchronous behavior is intentional. The use of `asyncio.gather` to run tasks concurrently further supports the need for asynchronous execution to efficiently process and validate multiple questions.

Given the context and the design of the script, it appears that the asynchronous implementation is a deliberate choice to optimize the performance of the application. Converting this to synchronous code could potentially degrade the performance, especially if the validation and formatting process involves network requests or other I/O operations that can be done in parallel.

Therefore, unless there are specific requirements or issues caused by the asynchronous design, it may be more appropriate to maintain the current implementation. If the goal is to understand the reason behind the asynchronous design, I hope this explanation provides clarity. If there are other concerns or if a change to synchronous code is desired for specific reasons, further discussion and clarification would be helpful to proceed accordingly.
