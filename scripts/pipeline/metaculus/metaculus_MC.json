Anything other than this (such as \"Stalemate\", a description of the peace agreement, or link to a results/aftermath section) will resolve this question as **Neither**.

In the context of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, such a description would imply that one side or the other is broadly considered to have \"won\" the war (at least among Western audiences). Alternatively, a stalemate or negotiated settlement would imply that neither side gained all the concessions from the other that they hoped for."

On top of this, AI labs have a history of splitting apart to form new labs. [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic) was founded by OpenAI employees; [Udio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udio) was founded by Google DeepMind employees. Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind CEO, has even mused about leaving and raising billions of dollars to start a new lab, reportedly on account of frustrations with corporate politics ([Victor, 2024](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-demis-hassabis-chafes-under-new-ai-push)).\n\nThis question asks about how many new, leading AI labs there are likely to be by the end of the decade. This is an interesting question for various groups of people. On the one hand, many are concerned that the big tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are the big players in AI, and that this might mean [even more centralization of power](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/22/ai-is-giving-big-tech-inordinate-power-tech-execs-say.html) absent new competition. On the other hand, people concerned about [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety#Existential_safety) are concerned that a greater number of labs will mean intensified [race dynamics](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-race) and a greater chance that at least one leading lab cuts corners on safety, to catastrophic effect."

President Tebboune, who first came to office in December 2019, is anticipated to seek re-election, though he has not yet formally declared his candidacy.\n\nUnder Tebboune's administration, Algeria has navigated significant economic and social challenges, including responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and fluctuating oil prices, which are critical for the country’s economy. Political reforms and public dissatisfaction with governance are also central themes, as the Hirak protest movement continues to influence the political landscape.

That is, if the state changed hands, the victor in the Electoral College would change as well.\n\n>The most rigorous way to define this is to sort the states in order of the most Democratic to the least Democratic, or most Republican to least Republican. Then count up the number of votes the candidate accumulates as he wins successively more difficult states. The state that provides him with the 270th electoral vote, clinching an Electoral College majority, is the swingiest state — the specific term I use for it is the “tipping point state.”\n\n>From Barack Obama’s perspective in 2008, for instance, his easiest three electoral votes were in the District of Columbia. The next-easiest were the four electoral votes in Hawaii, giving him seven total. Repeat this process and you find that Colorado was the tipping point state in 2008, putting him over the top with 278 electoral votes.\n\nPast Tipping Points have been Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004 for George W.

This bold forecast is due to two primary factors: 1) underlying forecasts indicating that the current El Niño conditions will transition to La Niña by peak hurricane season, which tends to suppress wind shear and allow more Atlantic storms to develop and strengthen, and 2) record warm sea surface temperatures across the tropical Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, providing ample oceanic heat energy to fuel hurricanes.\n\nWhile the historic performance of April hurricane forecasts is [relatively poor](https://seasonalhurricanepredictions.bsc.es/background-information/skill), the CSU forecasters note high confidence this year due to the clear transition to La Niña conditions and record ocean warmth already in place. If accurate, 2024 would see the 3rd highest number of named storms, 5th most hurricanes, 9th most major hurricanes, and 9th highest ACE value on record.\n\nThe [Atlantic hurricane season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane_season) runs from June 1 to November 30."

Once the individual journalists have voted their top 5, with first place receiving 6 points, second place receiving 4 points, third place receiving 3 points, fourth place receiving 2 points, and fifth place receiving 1 point, the player who earns the most overall points among voters is deemed to have won the award.

According to the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/sri-lanka-election-2024):\n\n>The country declared bankruptcy amid a severe shortage of food, fuel and other necessities, triggering protests that caused the-then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee and resign. The election also comes amid an IMF recovery program that kicked in last year, which opposition members have been critical of due to heavy taxes and privatization plans to meet targets. Thus, the polls will likely be seen as a referendum on Wickremesinghe, a career politician who has sought to be the face of a recovering Sri Lanka. Countries such as India and China, which provided assistance and loans to the country, will be closely watching the polls as will Sri Lanka’s bilateral and private lenders. \n\nSources have estimated the election will be held as early as September 2024 or as late as November. The major candidates are as follows.\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe: The incumbent President of Sri Lanka, elected by the Parliament of Sri Lanka in July 2022. He has [not yet](https://colombogazette.com/2024/04/15/who-will-blink-first-when-why-and-how/) officially declared his candidacy but is widely expected to announce.

In the most recent [poll](https://www.ihp.lk/press-releases/nppjvp-maintains-lead-voting-intentions-continuing-increase-sjb-support) by the Institute for Health Policy, which has been the main pollster for this election so far, Wickremesinghe is trailing the other candidates.\n\nSajith Premadasa: The Leader of the Opposition, which is an [official title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Sri_Lanka)) in the country, Premadasa is also head of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (United People's Power), which is the political alliance that holds the second highest number of seats in the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Premadasa is in second place in the [polling averages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Sri_Lankan_presidential_election#Nationwide), at the time of this question. \n\nAnura Kumara Dissanayake: The frontrunner according to the polling averages as of early 2024, Dissanayake is a socialist and head of the National People's Power political alliance. According to [this column](https://www.ft.lk/columns/The-last-endgame-AKD-NPP-positioned-to-win-but-should-beware/4-755751) by a political scientist in the Daily Financial Times, Dissanayake has a strong electoral position going into election season."
