As the incumbent mayor, he will be seeking to continue serving in the role. In late 2022, he said that [\u201cstill very much [his] intention to run and win a third term](https://www.cityam.com/khan-says-it-is-my-intention-to-run-and-win-third-term-as-london-mayor/). \n\nAccording to [smarkets.com](https://smarkets.com/event/42282035/politics/uk/london-mayoral-election/2024-london-mayoral-election-winner), the top three follow-up candidates for 2024 London mayoral election winner after Sadiq Khan are Jeremy Corbyn, Dawn Butler, and David Lammy. \n\nPreviously, London mayoral elections used the supplementary vote system. The supplementary vote system is a method of conducting elections in which voters are allowed to cast two votes for a single office. The first vote is for their preferred candidate, and the second vote is for their second choice. If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first-choice votes, they are declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the two candidates with the most first-choice votes move on to a second round of voting. In this round, only the second-choice votes of voters who selected one of the two remaining candidates as their first choice are counted. The candidate with the most votes in the second round is declared the winner. \n\nHowever, for the 2024 mayoral election, based on the Elections Act 2022, the election will be conducted under the [first-past-the-post system.](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-past-the-post-to-be-introduced-for-all-local-mayoral-and-police-and-crime-commissioner-elections) Under this system, each voter gets to cast a ballot for their preferred candidate, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins the election. This means that the winner may not necessarily have received a majority of the votes, but rather just more votes than any other individual candidate.\n\nIn the last election, [no candidate received more than 50% of the vote]( https://www.londonelects.org.uk/im-voter/election-results/results-2021-elections/results-factsheet-2021):\n\n>Had a candidate received more than 50 per cent of the total good first choice votes, they would have been elected without considering second choice votes. No candidate did so. The candidate with the highest number of first choice votes, Sadiq Khan, gained 40 per cent of the total first choice votes for all candidates (1,013,721 as a percentage of 2,531,357).\n\nSo far, all London mayors (Livingstone, Johnson, and Khan) have served two terms only.

Classifications may change over time, based on the evolving situation and information available.\n\n**Variant of Interest (VOI)**\n>. . . Variants designated as VOI include variants that have:\n>\n>* reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination.\n>* reduced efficacy of FDA approved treatments, or diagnostic tests.\n>* predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.\n>\n>Possible attributes of a Variant of Interest include:\n>\n>* specific genetic markers that are predicted to affect transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape.\n>* evidence that it is the cause of an increased proportion of cases or unique outbreak clusters.\n\n**Variant of Concern (VOC)**\n>. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of interest, variants designated as VOC include:\n>\n>* increase in transmissibility.\n>* more severe disease (for example, increased hospitalizations or deaths).\n>* significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.\n>* reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.\n\n**Variant of High Consequence (VOHC)**\n>A VOHC has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of concern, variants designated as VOHC include impact on MCMs such as:\n>\n>* demonstrated failure of diagnostic test targets.\n>* evidence to suggest a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness, a disproportionately high number of infections in vaccinated persons, or very low vaccine-induced protection against severe disease.\n>* significantly reduced susceptibility to multiple EUA or approved therapeutics.\n>* more severe clinical disease and increased hospitalizations.\n\nThe variant class hierarchy is described by the CDC as follows:\n\n>Each variant classification includes the possible attributes of lower classes (for example, VOC includes the possible attributes of VOI). . . U.S. classifications may differ from the WHO classifications because the impact of variants may differ by location.\n\nAs of December 1, 2023, only \"Omicron (parent lineages)\" is classified as a VOC.
