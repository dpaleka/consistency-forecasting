questions can be NOT resolved (future expiration date), even though they are active: "closed"and are clearly already done
    Fix by if the question 

    we want to remove unresolved questions in the future.
    is closed = True and
    resolution: NULL (resolved:False) and 
    DATE today is BEFORE the {start date of file}

    we want to remove resolved questions in the past
    is closed == False




    close_time:  when is the latest it's supposed to close.
    effected_close_time:  if closed_earlier than close_time, else None
    resolve_time: when the question officially resolves.  Note this can be much later than close or effected_close_time if we need to wait on some data.

    "close_time":"2024-11-05T00:00:00Z","effected_close_time":"2024-03-04T15:00:00Z","resolve_time":"2024-03-04T15:00:00Z


    generally should filter:
    if effected_close_time (this one the best)
    else:
        min(close_time, resolve_time)


    for headers then (filtering):
        close_time and resolve_time < end_date
        effected_close_time < end_date if it exists

        same for start but reverse signs
