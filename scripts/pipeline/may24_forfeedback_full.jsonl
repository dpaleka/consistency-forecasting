A \"nuclear test\" is defined as any detonation of a nuclear device intended to test the explosive capabilities of nuclear weaponry, regardless of the yield of the explosion. Verification of a nuclear test will be based on official announcements from the North Korean government, or, in the absence of such announcements, confirmation by at least three of the following international authorities or reputable news organizations: the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), BBC, CNN, Reuters, or The New York Times. Satellite imagery or other credible evidence supporting the occurrence of a nuclear test will also be considered sufficient for resolution. In the event of ambiguous or conflicting reports, the question will resolve as Yes only if the majority of cited sources confirm the test. Edge cases, such as non-explosive nuclear tests or tests conducted in collaboration with other countries, will be considered as fulfilling the criteria for a nuclear test.", "resolution_date": "2025-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "synthetic", "url": null, "metadata": {"tags": "North Korea", "category": "Social Sciences"}, "resolution": null}
