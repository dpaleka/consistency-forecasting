Many individuals, corporations, and countries have taking action to show international solidarity with Ukraine.\nIn the sporting world, Russia has been banned from a number of recent international events. On Feb 28th 2022, four days after Russia invaded, FIFA made an unprecedented decision to ban Russian clubs and the national team from all competitions including the World Cup.\nFootball is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine. Both Presidents [FIFA and UEFA] hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.\nIn 2023, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) has reiterated their position several times [1][2] that Russian and Belarusian athletes can only compete as Individual Neutral Athletes.\nDespite IOC recommendations Poland banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2023 European Games. In Paris, the 2024 Olympic host city, event organizers cancelled a World Cup fencing event after the FIE (International Fencing Federation) decision to allow Russian athletes to resume competing one year after the invasion of Ukraine.\nLooking back at previous Olympics, Russia's Track and Field team was barred from the 2016 Olympics over a decade long doping scandal. 68 Athletes filled appeals that were ultimately dismissed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, though some Russian athletes were able to compete as 'Authorized Neutral Athletes'. At the 2016 Paralympics the entire Russian Paralympic team was banned over the same doping scandal.\n"

Speculative reports, opinion pieces, or unofficial announcements will not suffice for resolution.\nThe question will resolve as \"No\" if these conditions are not met as of July 15, 2024.\nNote: The question does not account for legal battles, appeals, or subsequent reversals that might occur after the mentioned date. It strictly pertains to whether Donald Trump has been removed from any state's primary election ballot for a federal office under the specified grounds as of July 15, 2024. If Trump is removed or blocked from a ballot and then reinstated, such that as of July 15th he is not removed or blocked from any ballot, the question resolves negatively.\n",

The Republican Secretary of State of New Hampshire, David Scanlan, while not actively seeking to remove any candidates, has stated that he will seek legal advice on the issue. Additionally, Michigan’s Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has indicated that she will seek a legal opinion on this matter. Voters have also filed lawsuits in Florida and Michigan on the issue. Legal battles are widely expected, and these disputes might reach the U.S. Supreme Court.\nShow More"

NBC reported that these arrest warrants could come as early as this week, and Israel is working through back channels to try to prevent them from being issued. The US and other G7 countries are reportedly campaigning to dissuade the ICC from issuing the warrants so as to avoid jeopardizing a peace deal between Israel and Hamas.\nAs the ICC explains on its official website, an arrest warrant is requested by the Prosecutor as part of the investigative stage before trial, especially in cases in which suspects do not appear voluntarily.\nThe ICC was founded in 2002 following the wars in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, and it is intended as a permanent court to investigate war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity done by individuals. It issued its first arrest warrants in 2005, and according to the AP has issued a total of 42 arrest warrants. Last year the ICC issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and one of his government officials stemming from the ICC's investigation into the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia.\nSee Also\nBase rate information at Wikipedia: International Criminal Court investigations\n"

Tood Woody, via Bloomberg describes his history at the ISA:\nLodge’s candidacy emerged Sunday in a diplomatic note from ISA member state Kiribati, a small South Pacific island nation that announced it would sponsor Lodge’s nomination. Candidates for secretary-general are usually sponsored by their country of citizenship: The UK sponsored Lodge’s first term as secretary-general (though his election to a second term, which happened under a “silent procedure” during the Covid-19 pandemic, is less clear). Carvalho, an official with UN Environment Programme in Nairobi, was likewise put forth by Brazil’s delegate in March.\nNotably, the UK was a signatory of a memorandum against DSM. However, as noted in the above article, Lodge has found support of island nations - such as Kiribati - who stand to benefit immensely from DSM.\nOne DSM company - The Metals Company (TMC) - has been a major supporter of DSM and has carried out extensive environmental studies supporting its position of allowing the practice. TMC has also carried out pilot studies in the Clarion-Clipper Zone (CCZ) with Allseas' dedicated Deep Sea Mining Vessel \"Hidden Gem\" which were successful.\nSee also Southern Fried Science: International Seabed Authority gears up for a leadership challenge at the July meeting.\n"
