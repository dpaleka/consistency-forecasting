As used in this subsection, the term \u201coffice\u201d does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.\nIn early August 2022, federal agents executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, the primary residence of Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States, in the course of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there. It has been speculated that Trump may eventually be charged with a crime in relation to these documents, potentially including an offense under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2071.\nAccording to Reuters:\nWhile the Presidential Records Act does not specify an enforcement mechanism, taking presidential records from the White House could open Trump up to charges of conspiring to impede the proper functioning of the National Archives, said Jeffrey Cohen, an associate professor at Boston College Law School and former federal prosecutor.\nHe could also be charged under a law, known by its code number 2071, making it a crime to conceal or destroy U.S. public documents, or laws making it illegal to steal or damage government property.\n...\nA provision of 2071 states that anyone convicted will be barred from holding federal office and face a prison term of up to three years.\nHowever, Reuters also notes:\nBut experts said that provision may not be constitutional. The U.S. Constitution sets forth the qualifications for holding federal elected office, and previous Supreme Court rulings have held that Congress cannot limit who can run for the presidency, the Senate or the House.\nIf convicted and disqualified from office, Trump would likely challenge it in court, where the outcome would be far from certain.\nAnother Metaculus question, 'Will any US court rule that Donald J. Trump is disqualified from holding the presidency before January 20th 2025?,' asks whether Trump will be disqualified from the presidency before inauguration day in 2025.

As the incumbent mayor, he will be seeking to continue serving in the role.

The supplementary vote system is a method of conducting elections in which voters are allowed to cast two votes for a single office. The first vote is for their preferred candidate, and the second vote is for their second choice. If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first-choice votes, they are declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the two candidates with the most first-choice votes move on to a second round of voting. In this round, only the second-choice votes of voters who selected one of the two remaining candidates as their first choice are counted. The candidate with the most votes in the second round is declared the winner.\nHowever, for the 2024 mayoral election, based on the Elections Act 2022, the election will be conducted under the first-past-the-post system. Under this system, each voter gets to cast a ballot for their preferred candidate, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins the election. This means that the winner may not necessarily have received a majority of the votes, but rather just more votes than any other individual candidate.\nIn the last election, no candidate received more than 50% of the vote:\nHad a candidate received more than 50 per cent of the total good first choice votes, they would have been elected without considering second choice votes. No candidate did so. The candidate with the highest number of first choice votes, Sadiq Khan, gained 40 per cent of the total first choice votes for all candidates (1,013,721 as a percentage of 2,531,357).\nSo far, all London mayors (Livingstone, Johnson, and Khan) have served two terms only.

The delayed vote has led to protests and unrest, as well as a state crackdown against the protests.\nSall's term is scheduled to end on April 2, 2024, and the delayed elections have led to uncertainty regarding whether Sall will respect the term limit.\nSenegal is in the geographical region of Africa that has seen a high rate of coups the past three years. Despite this, Senegal had previously maintained some stability and helped coordinate responses against coups elsewhere in the region.\nYet when Sall was interviewed by The Economist in October 2023 he asked,\n\"Is democracy as we want to do it really suitable?\"\nPreviously there had been a damaging fight between the incumbent president and an opposition leader, Ousmane Sonko. The Economist wrote,\nThe fight centres around the question of whether Senegal\u2019s government is trying to tilt the election by using the courts to keep Mr Sonko off the ballot.\nThis has involved accusations of rape (acquitted), corruption of youth (convicted), plotting an insurrection (still active). The opposition claims this is repeating a pattern from 2019 when the opposition was also barred from running due to criminal convictions. The incumbent president denies this.\nThe charge and conviction sparked large protests, some of them violent, in support of Mr Sonko. The demonstrations were also fuelled by hints from Mr Sall that he might try to run for a third presidential term, even though Senegal\u2019s constitution has a two-term limit. It was only in July that Mr Sall definitively said he would not seek office again, after more than two years of protests and at least 37 deaths, according to Amnesty International, a rights group.\nMr Sall\u2019s announcement led to a lull in the violence, though it lasted less than a month until Mr Sonko was once more arrested. The government also dissolved his political party, Pastef, and arrested many of its leaders, including several mayors. As protests flared, the government cut mobile-internet access for almost a week.\nThere seems to be insecurities around how peaceful Senegal's democracy really is:\nMany fear more violence before the election, especially if Mr Sonko is definitively barred from running. Even Mr Sall prevaricates when asked if he expects the election to be peaceful. [...] Mr Sall bristles at the suggestion there has been a backsliding of democracy on his watch. \u201cThose who say that [there has been] are supporters of anarchy and chaos,\u201d he retorts. \u201cSenegal has no lessons in democracy to learn from anyone.\u201d\n"}, "resolution": null}

Classifications may change over time, based on the evolving situation and information available.\nVariant of Interest (VOI)\n. . . Variants designated as VOI include variants that have:\nreduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination.\nreduced efficacy of FDA approved treatments, or diagnostic tests.\npredicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.\nPossible attributes of a Variant of Interest include:\nspecific genetic markers that are predicted to affect transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape.\nevidence that it is the cause of an increased proportion of cases or unique outbreak clusters.\nVariant of Concern (VOC)\n. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of interest, variants designated as VOC include:\nincrease in transmissibility.\nmore severe disease (for example, increased hospitalizations or deaths).\nsignificant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.\nreduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.\nVariant of High Consequence (VOHC)\nA VOHC has clear evidence that prevention measures or medical countermeasures (MCMs) have significantly reduced effectiveness relative to previously circulating variants. . . In addition to the possible attributes of a variant of concern, variants designated as VOHC include impact on MCMs such as:\ndemonstrated failure of diagnostic test targets.\nevidence to suggest a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness, a disproportionately high number of infections in vaccinated persons, or very low vaccine-induced protection against severe disease.\nsignificantly reduced susceptibility to multiple EUA or approved therapeutics.\nmore severe clinical disease and increased hospitalizations.\nThe variant class hierarchy is described by the CDC as follows:\nEach variant classification includes the possible attributes of lower classes (for example, VOC includes the possible attributes of VOI). . .

In the nonendowed condition, participants were simply offered a choice between learning a bundle of three or a separate bundle of four facts, with the bundles shown in randomized order.\nResults of a chi-square goodness-of-fit test indicated that participants in the endowed condition were more likely to express a preference for learning three (versus four) facts than participants in the nonendowed condition. This supported the original researchers\u2019 hypothesis that individuals exhibit the endowment effect for non-instrumental information.\nIn our study, we followed the same procedure, except that we distinguished between the half of the nonendowed condition where the 3-fact bundle was displayed on top and the half where the 4-fact bundle was displayed on top (these were represented by Conditions 2 and 3 respectively in the diagram above), so that we could conduct an additional analysis in case order effects had been contributing to the original study results (explained below). For the purposes of assessing whether the original study replicated in our dataset, however, Conditions 2 and 3 were pooled into one combined nonendowed condition. This means that our pooled Conditions 2 and 3 are together equivalent to (a larger version of) the original study\u2019s nonendowed condition. (For details, see The Details section.)\nNone of the facts presented were of objectively greater utility or interest than any of the others. Facts related to, for example, the behavior of a particular animal, or the fact that the unicorn is the national animal of a country. Furthermore, each time we ran the experiment, we randomized which facts appeared in which order across both bundles. The subjective utility of a given fact would not be expected to affect experimental results due to this randomization process.\nThe original study included 146 adult participants from Prolific. Our replication included 631 adult participants (not counting exclusions) from MTurk via Positly.com.\nThe Details\nIn the original experiment, two variables had varied across conditions - both endowment and the order of presentation of the two bundles had varied. Option order had been randomized within the endowed condition such that a 3-fact bundle was shown on top half the time while a 4-fact bundle was shown on top the other half of the time within that condition. On the other hand, option order was not randomized in the endowed condition: the 3-fact bundle was always shown on top within that condition. To control for ordering effects, we increased sample size to 1.5 times our original planned size and split the nonendowed condition (now double the size it would otherwise have been) into two separate conditions: Conditions 2 and 3. Our participants were randomized into one of three conditions, as described below:\nCondition 1: Endowed - Participants were told that they were on course to learn a specific bundle of three facts and were then offered the option to learn four different facts instead.\nCondition 2: Nonendowed with 3-fact bundle displayed on top - Participants were offered a choice between learning three facts or four facts, with the bundle of 3 facts appearing as the top option.\nCondition 3: Nonendowed with 4-fact bundle displayed on top - Participants were offered a choice between learning three facts or four facts, with the bundle of 4 facts appearing as the top option\nAnalysis\nTo evaluate the replicability of the original study, we ran a chi-square goodness-of-fit test to evaluate differences in preference for learning three facts between participants in the endowed versus the pooled nonendowed conditions. As stated in our pre-registration, our policy was to consider the study to have replicated if this test yielded a statistically significant result, with the difference in the same direction as the original finding (i.e., with a higher proportion of participants selecting the 3-fact bundle in the endowed compared to the pooled nonendowed conditions).\n", "data_source": "metaculus", "question_type": "binary", "resolution_date": "2024-05-06T14:50:00Z", "url": "https://www.metaculus.com/questions/22299", "metadata": {"topics": [], "background_info": "The Transparent Replications Project by Clearer Thinking aims to replicate studies from randomly-selected, newly-published papers in prestigious psychology journals, as well as any psychology papers recently published in Nature or Science involving online participants.\nContext: How often have social science studies tended to replicate in the past?\nIn one historical project that attempted to replicate 100 experimental and correlation studies from 2008 in three important psychology journals, analysis indicated that they successfully replicated 40%, failed to replicate 30%, and the remaining 30% were inconclusive. (To put it another way, of the replications that were not inconclusive, 57% were successful replications.)\nIn another project, researchers attempted to replicate all experimental social science science papers (that met basic inclusion criteria) published in Nature or Science (the two most prestigious general science journals) between 2010 and 2015. They found a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 62% (i.e., 13 out of 21) studies, and the effect sizes of the replications were, on average, about 50% of the original effect sizes. Replicability varied between 57% and 67% depending on the replicability indicator used.\nThe replication described here was run as part of the Transparent Replications project, which has not run enough replications yet for us to give any base replication rates.

During its founding years in 2003 - 2005, Musk invested heavily into the company, eventually becoming chair of the board of directors and one of the largest shareholders; he subsequently became CEO in October 2008. His success at the company has seen Tesla become the 17th largest company in the world by market cap with its share price soaring since its June 2010 IPO.\nAs a result of his immense success as CEO, a $56 billion pay package to Musk was approved by Tesla's board of the directors in 2018. However, Musk has yet to receive this package, as per the FT:\nTesla\u2019s board has been lobbying investors to re-ratify the $56bn award given in 2018, which was struck down by a Delaware judge in January due to concerns over its size and the independence of the board. In response, Musk vowed to leave the state and move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\nTesla chair Robyn Denholm has argued that Musk deserves to be paid so much because the company hit ambitious targets for revenue and its stock price. She brushed off criticism she is too close to the CEO as \u201ccrap\u201d.\nAside from the sheer size of the pay package - the largest of its kind - those who oppose it call into question various decisions made by Musk during his tenure as CEO. In particular, Musk's social media activity has been called into question, and perhaps most notably the:\nPurchase - and subsequent rebrand - of Twitter (now X) for $44 billion which has attracted a lot of negative criticism and has also seen Musk spend a disproportionate amount of time at that company instead of Tesla.\nPurchase of $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in 2021 and allowing the cryptocurrency to be used by customers for purchasing Tesla automobiles. The company promptly stopped accepting the currency - causing the price to plummet - after which Tesla announced they had sold almost all of their Bitcoin holdings at a loss.\nDuring significant shareholder votes like this one, influential proxy advisory firms often send out advice to shareholders on what to vote and why. According to Wikipedia:\nA proxy firm provides services to shareholders (in most cases an institutional investor of some type) to vote their shares at shareholder meetings of, usually, listed companies.\nThe two largest proxy advisory firms are ISS and Glass Lewis. The latter has advised shareholders not to vote in favour of Musk's package as well as advising shareholders to vote against the re-election of Kimbal Musk - brother of Elon Musk - from the board of directors. The ISS, however, has yet to issue any advice with respect to the June 13 shareholder meeting.\nSee related question:\nWill a non-Disney-nominated board member be elected to Disney's board at the April 3, 2024, shareholder meeting?\n"}, "resolution": null}
