First, exhale completely, then inhale a deep breath. Wait 10 seconds, then‚Äîwithout exhaling‚Äîinhale a little more. Wait another five seconds, then top up the breath again. Finally, exhale. Generally, you will find that your singultus is gone. \n> With collaborators, Morris went on to conduct a study of 19 patients, 12 male and seven female, from the ages of 10 to 51, who ‚Äúpresented with hiccups ranging in duration from 20 min to 8h.‚Äù As they reported, in a second letter to the editor, this time in the Journal of Emergency Medicine, thanks to the SSMI technique, ‚Äúan immediate and permanent termination to hiccups was achieved in 16 of the 19 patients (84%).

An announcement from the pope regarding the imminent return of Jesus would have enormous religious, social, and global implications.\n\nThis question prompts  to consider several factors: the theological foundations of Christian eschatology, the historical context of papal declarations, and the current state of world affairs  challenging us to think about how such an announcement would be received by the global community, both within and outside the Christian faith. Would people react with belief, skepticism, or indifference? How would governments, other religious leaders, and media respond?\n\nThe scenario also raises questions about the role of the pope in interpreting and conveying divine messages. Historically, the Catholic Church has been cautious about making definitive statements regarding prophetic events, but why couldn't an imam announce it for example ?!. Therefore, contemplating this question encourages a deeper following and observation of religious prophecy in a stumbled modern world, the responsibilities of religious leaders, and the potential impact of such a momentous declaration on modern society.",

            "resolution_criteria": "[experimental market]\n\nWhat is this market for? It's for users that have a hard time being profitable on manifold, but would like to still make profits with their mana. Experienced users can help with this, and hearing their reasoning can help you improve your reasoning around market probabilities.\n\nCheck the comments. Experienced traders will sometimes share markets that are mispriced, ie you can profit on them by betting your mana. These traders might not find it worthwhile to bet on these markets because they resolve in too much time, or because they have better markets to spend their mana on (Risk-free interest rates != 0).\n\nIf you bet on a market because of a comment below, you are encouraged to state this, and tip the person that wrote the comment with 20% to 40% of the profits you made because of them. If you take all the \"alpha\" (fix the shared market to the correct price), you should say that so that others don't waste their time on that market.\n\nThis is a beginner friendly market, so you are welcome to ask questions. Some example might be \"I think this market (with a link) is super overpriced, for this or that reason. Can someone let me know if they think I'm wrong?\". If you have further questions, the [manifold discord](https://discord.com/invite/eHQBNBqXuh) is great for this.\n\nSome extra details: \n\nIf someone lies to steal people's mana, by saying false things about markets to enrich themselves, they will be banished and shamed. I'll also probably close this market and consider the experiment a failure.\n\nIf I consider a comment with a free mana claim to be wrong but not malicious, I reserve the right to hide this comment so others don't see it.\n\nPlease do not break site rules! Do not trick people into giving you quick profits at their expense.\n\nIf you consider a free-mana claim to be wrong, comment under it with your reasoning. We can discuss the merits of it if they are uncertain.\n\nResolution Criterion: If 20 profit opportunities are shared, and someone comments under them saying they have taken them (without lying about this), before August, the market resolves YES.\n\nTipping tutorial: Press the ... at the top of a comment, you will see this menu:\n\n[image]You can click Tip and select the amount you want to send.",

This would only happen if it's sufficiently clear. Otherwise, it resolves to the poll even if the poll results are gamed.\n\nIf anything is unclear, ask in comments.",

To do so would be a large update from the current article, which cites many sources distinguishing the current offensive from a \"full-scale\" offensive and only directly describes the operation as a \"limited invasion\".\n\nAs a point of comparison, language like the current Wikipedia article describing the overall invasion of the Gaza Strip would be sufficient for a YES resolution:\n\nThe Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip is an ongoing part of the Israel-Hamas war. Immediately after the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Israel began the bombing of Gaza Strip and by October 27 Israel had launched a full-scale invasion.\n\nThis is intended to be a high bar. In any ambiguous situation, this market's resolution will err towards NO. \n\nThis market requires that both the escalation and the updates to the Wikipedia article to take place before July. If these conditions have not been met, this market resolves NO.\n\nWikipedia vandalism/edit wars will not impact this market's resolution. If the Wikipedia article is folded into another article, that article will be used for resolution instead.\n\nThis market's resolution will be based on the market creator's best judgement of Wikipedia's consensus, in consultation with other members of the Manifold community.

The film features Sebastian Stan as a young Trump and Jeremy Strong as his lawyer, Roy Cohn. While the movie has received mixed reviews, with some critics praising the performances and others calling it 'solid rather than spectacular,' it has sparked significant controversy. The Trump campaign has announced plans to sue the filmmakers over a scene that portrays Trump raping his wife Ivana. The film received an 11-minute ovation at Cannes, despite the backlash. Abbasi has dismissed Trump's threats of legal action, maintaining that the film allows viewers to feel 'sympathy' for Trump. The Trump campaign has labeled the film 'malicious defamation' and 'pure fiction.'\n\n-----\n\nThe market will resolve \"Yes\" if Trump or someone associated with his organization files a defamation lawsuit or similar, in a relevant court (probably in Europe), for a substantial amount. \n\nOR the market will resolve \"Yes\" if the film is publicly withdrawn with apology or a note about a lawsuit, or settlement with the Trump organization.\n\nThe market will resolve \"No\" if time expires and there is no substantial legal action.

            "resolution_criteria": "It's been proposed that Manifold implement \"N/A shares\" on binary markets. This would be a way for markets to resolve to N/A without having to reverse previous trades. \n\nWill Manifold implement \"N/A shares\" in any form, on at least one market, before September 1, 2024?\n\nTo do this, instead of binary markets just being resolvable to YES or NO, with N/A being a magical option that reverses trades, they would instead be resolvable to YES, NO, or N/A. Users would be able to buy N/A shares in a market that return mana when the market resolves N/A. By default, users could keep all of their N/A shares when they buy a position in a market, but advanced users would be able to buy N/A shares or to buy YES/NO shares without buying N/A shares.\n\nThis allows us to keep on having N/A post-pivot, but it also allows us to calculate a probability of the market resolving to N/A, which is an interesting statistic to keep track of. A downside of this however is that users can be extra incentivized to make a market resolve to N/A, since they could buy just N/A shares.\n\nHere's a concrete example: \n\nI create a market with 1000 mana of liquidity, so the pool starts with 1000 YES, 1000 NO, and 1000 N/A shares. Concretely, this is kind of like 33% YES, 33% NO, and 33% N/A, but the UI would by default just show the relative YES-NO percentage (so 50%). (We'll assume p=1/3.)\n\nI will use \"z\" as the variable for N/A shares.\n\ny = 1000\n\nn = 1000\n\nz = 1000\n\np = 1/3\n\nthus k = y^p √ó n^(1-p-p) √ó z^(1-p-p) = 1000\n\nsimple likelihood YES = 50%\n\nsimple likelihood NO = 50%\n\nImagine an advanced user comes along and wants to buy 100 mana worth of YES shares. They're an advanced user, so they're only buying YES shares. They send 100 mana to the AMM. The AMM turns that in 100 YES, 100 NO and 100 N/A shares.\n\ny = 1100\n\nn = 1100\n\nz = 1100\n\nWe want to maintain the k, so we will return Y YES shares to the user:\n\nk = (y-Y)^p √ó n^(1-p-p) √ó z^(1-p-p)\n\n1000 = (1100-Y)^(1/3) √ó 1100^1/3 √ó 1100^1/3\n\nY ~= 274\n\nSo now the pool has \n\ny = 726\n\nn = 1100\n\nz = 1100\n\nand the user has 274 YES shares. \n\nIf the market resolves to N/A they get nothing back.\n\nIf the market resolves to YES, they get 274 mana.\n\nsimple likelihood YES = 1100 / (726 + 1100) ~= 60%\n\nsimple likelihood NO = 726 / (726 + 1100) ~= 40%\n\nImagine a new user comes along and wants to buy 100 mana worth of YES shares. Since they're using the default UI, we're going to have them actually buy both YES shares and 100 N/A shares. They send 100 mana to the AMM. The AMM turns that in 100 YES, 100 NO and 100 N/A shares.\n\ny = 1100\n\nn = 1100\n\nz = 1100\n\nAll 100 N/A shares are returned to the user by default, so now\n\ny = 1100\n\nn = 1100\n\nz = 1000\n\nWe want to maintain the k, so we will return Y YES shares to the user:\n\nk = (y-Y)^p √ó n^(1-p-p) √ó z^(1-p-p)\n\n1000 = (1100-Y)^(1/3) √ó 1100^1/3 √ó 1000^1/3\n\nY ~= 190\n\nSo now we have \n\ny = 810\n\nn = 1100\n\nz = 1000\n\nand the user has 190 YES shares and 100 N/A shares. \n\nIf the market resolves to N/A they get their initial mana back.\n\nIf the market resolves to YES, they get 190 mana.\n\nsimple likelihood YES = 1100 / (810 + 1100) ~= 58%\n\nsimple likelihood NO = 810 / (810 + 1100) ~= 42%",
