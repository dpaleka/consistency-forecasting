What is missing:


predictit
Resolution criteria is displayed on actual website but not on API
https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/6867/Which-party-will-win-the-2024-US-presidential-election%22,

resolution_date parameter exists in api but is usually empty

not much additional metadata


manifold
resolution criteria exists neither exists on website nor on API
https://manifold.markets/firstuserhere/which-country-will-win-the-most-med

not much additional metadata


metaculus
resolution criteria exists on website but not in API
https://www.metaculus.com/questions/111/will-there-be-a-total-solar-eclipse-on-june-25-2522/

decent amount of additional metadata if useful


Overall:
Resolution criteria looks like it's tricky to get from the api but the data is out there if we want to manually scrape the website by urls.  
I tried doing this but did not make much headway since it involves manually combing through the html tags I would assume.
Generally resolution is also just a tab whether it is open or not (questions are generally open)

For each parameter the apis each could have slightly different names and formatting.
For example,
dates
question types: polls, continuous exist on one but not others
Resolution: returns "Open" or false, meaning the same thing.

Not sure if it's worth the effort to completely standardize these things
