Erdo\u011fan has been president of T\u00fcrkiye since 2014, having previously served as Prime Minister. This election is crucial because Erdo\u011fan is aiming to extend his 20-year rule in elections that will decide not just who leads T\u00fcrkiye but how it is governed, where its economy is headed and what role it may play to ease conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nIn T\u00fcrkiye, the President is elected through a two-round system. In order to be elected, a candidate must receive more than 50% of the popular vote. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff is held between the two most voted-for candidates. The President is limited to two consecutive five-year terms, with the possibility of a third term if snap elections are held with the consent of 60% of MPs or by presidential decree. To run for presidency, a candidate must be at least 40 years old, have completed higher education, and can be put forward by a political party that has won 5% of the vote in the previous parliamentary election or an independent who collects 100,000 signatures.\nAccording to the Wikipedia page of the election, there are four candidates that have declared their intention to run.\nCandidate Background\nRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan Incumbent President of T\u00fcrkiye (2014-present)\nCem Uzan Former leader of the Young Party (GP)\nMuharrem \u0130nce Leader of the Homeland Party, candidate for president in 2018\nSinan O\u011fan Former member of the parliament from MHP (2011\u20132015)\nThere are also a variety of potential candidates that may run for president but have not yet officially declared so.\nCandidate Background\nKemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu Leader of Republican People's Party, leader of the opposition\nAhmet Davuto\u011flu Leader of the Future Party, 26th Prime Minister of T\u00fcrkiye (2014-2015)\nAli Babacan Leader of the Democracy and Progress Party, Deputy Prime Minister of T\u00fcrkiye (2009-2015),\nG\u00fcltekin Uysal Leader of the Democrat Party\nTemel Karamollao\u011flu Leader of the Felicity Party, Mayor of Sivas (1989\u20131995), candidate for president in 2018\nPervin Buldan Co-leader of the Peoples' Democratic Party, Deputy Speaker of Parliament (2015-2018)\nFatih Erbakan Leader of New Welfare Party\nAbdullah G\u00fcl 11th President of T\u00fcrkiye (2007-2014), 24th Prime Minister of T\u00fcrkiye (2002\u20132003),\nS\u00fcleyman Soylu Minister of Interior (2016-present), Minister of Labour and Social Security (2015-2016)\nDo\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek Leader of Patriotic Party, candidate for president in 2018\nTansu \u00c7iller 22nd Prime Minister of T\u00fcrkiye (1993\u20131996)\nMustafa Sar\u0131g\u00fcl Leader of Party for Change in Turkey, Mayor of \u015ei\u015fli (1999-2014)\nThere are also a variety of candidates that have declined to run at some point.

CNBC reported Friday that one venture capitalist said it was like someone shouted \u201cfire in a crowded theater where there is no fire,\u201d leading many businesses and tech investors to ask for their money back from banks just to be safe.\nThere is already some evidence of contagion to regional banks as a result of this fear. Trading in multiple regional banks stocks including PacWest Bancorp, Western Alliance Bancorp, and First Republic Bank was halted Friday amid aggressive selling from investors.\nFirst Republic has aimed to calm investors by claiming that their \u201cliquidity and deposits remained strong\u201d and that it had a \u201cvery well diversified deposit base\u201d. However, there remains a serious risk of contagion to regional banks like First Republic Bank.", "resolution_date": "2023-05-01", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "metaculus", "url": "https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/15421/", "metadata": {"is_resolved": true, "date_begin": "2023-03-11", "date_close": "2023-12-31", "gpt_3p5_category": "Economics & Business", "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2024, First Republic Bank or any of its subsidiaries have been placed under FDIC receivership OR First Republic Bank has signed a deal to be purchased by another organization, which has been characterized as a bail out, a rescue, or in response to liquidity trouble by credible sources.

It includes 24 stocks of large U.S. national money center banks, regional banks, and thrift institutions that are publicly traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Some of the banks included in the index are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. The index is widely used as a benchmark for the banking sector and is considered a key indicator of the health and performance of the U.S. banking industry. At the beginning of the year, the index stood at $101.46 reaching a 2023-high of $115.10 in early February. However, since the beginning of March, the price has crashed from $109.33 on March 1 to $92.22 on March 10 on the basis of sector-wide concern over financial contagion from recent bank collapses:\nIn March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank was shut down by US banking regulators\nSilicon Valley Bank was shuttered by US regulators on Friday after customers raced to withdraw $42bn \u2014 a quarter of its total deposits \u2014 in one day and a failed effort to raise new capital called into question the future of the tech-focused lender. With about $209bn in assets, SVB has become the second-largest bank failure in US history, after the 2008 collapse of Washington Mutual, and marks a swift fall from grace for a lender that was valued at more than $44bn less than 18 months ago.\nThis comes a few days after crypto bank Silvergate shut down:\nSilvergate, the San Diego-based regional lender that transformed itself into a go-to bank for the crypto industry, plans to wind down operations in the face of turmoil in digital currency markets. Citing \u201crecent industry and regulatory developments\u201d, Silvergate on Wednesday announced that a \u201cvoluntary liquidation of the bank is the best path forward\u201d. The disclosure sent its stock down more than 30 per cent in after-hours trading to $3 a share. In the past few years Silvergate had developed into the largest cryptocurrency bank in the US, attracting as much as $14bn in customer deposits and reaching a stock price of more than $200 in late 2021.\nThis raises the fears of more widespread contagion risk in the US banking sector, though a 2008-like collapse is seen as unlikely. As the Washington Post reports:\nWith $209 billion in assets, the [SVB] was just one-eighteenth the size of JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest. Still, Wall Street was rattled by SVB\u2019s abrupt end, the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history, after Washington Mutual in 2008.\nShare prices of the industry\u2019s five largest players \u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs \u2014 fell heavily in SVB\u2019s final days.

The KBW Bank index in the US has suffered the heaviest losses, falling 18% in March, while Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 banks index has fallen 15% and Japan\u2019s Topix banking sector index is down 9%.\nA specific bank of interest is Credit Suisse, which is facing a crisis of confidence, with its share price at record lows and its largest investor ruling out providing more capital. Efforts to stabilise the bank, including a SFr50bn ($54bn) emergency credit line from the Swiss central bank, have had limited success. As a result, UBS is in talks to take over all or part of Credit Suisse, with the Swiss National Bank and regulator Finma orchestrating the negotiations in an attempt to shore up confidence in the country\u2019s banking sector. The potential takeover comes after a series of scandals and crises, including the collapses of Greensill Capital and Archegos, which resulted in billions of dollars of losses. Other options under consideration include breaking up Credit Suisse and raising funds via a public offering of its ringfenced Swiss division, with the wealth and asset management units being sold to UBS or other bidders. A full merger would create one of the biggest global systemically important financial institutions in Europe, but some see it as too unwieldy to execute.\nOverall, Credit Suisse is facing a variety of potential outcomes in the coming weeks, including collapse (i.e., bankruptcy, insolvency, or general cessation of operations), full acquisition (e.g., acquisition of at least 50% of the voting shares), partial acquisition (e.g., sale of one of its business units or divisions), break-up (split of Credit Suisse into at least two entities), bailout (i.e., government-backed provision of financial assistance), further central bank liquidity support (e.g., additional interventions from the Swiss National Bank).\nWill Credit Suisse experience any of the following scenarios before May 2023?\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Credit Suisse experiences any of the following scenarios based on reports by credible sources before May 1, 2023. For resolution of this question, official announcements of any of these scenarios suffice for positive resolution for as long as they are definite in their future implementation.\nScenarios:\n1) Collapse: Bankruptcy, insolvency, or general cessation of operations.\n2) Full Acquisition: Acquisition of at least 50% of the voting shares by another financial institution.\n3) Partial Acquisition: Sale of one or more of its business units or divisions to other financial institutions.\n4) Break-up: Split of Credit Suisse into at least two separate entities.\n5) Government Bailout: Government-backed provision of financial assistance.\n6) Central Bank Support: Additional interventions from the Swiss National Bank.\n7) International Support: Financial assistance from international institutions such as the IMF or central banks from other countries.", "extracted_urls": "[\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/credit-suisse-and-ubs-to-merge-202303.html\", \"https://twitter.com/business/status/1637513776915259392\", \"https://twitter.com/davidfaber/status/1637498962306379778\", \"https://www.ft.com/content/ec4be743-052a-4381-a923-c2fbd7ea9cfd\", \"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-19/switzerland-weighs-full-or-partial-credit-suisse-nationalization?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&leadSource=uverify%20wall\", \"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-19/credit-suisse-said-to-push-back-against-ubs-s-1-billion-offer?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&leadSource=uverify%20wall\", \"https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1637433299709620224\", \"https://www.ft.com/content/ec4be743-052a-4381-a923-c2fbd7ea9cfd\", \"https://news.sky.com/story/uk-regulators-back-merger-of-banking-giants-credit-suisse-and-ubs-12837876\", \"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/crunch-weekend-crisis-hit-credit-154055428.html\", \"https://www.ft.com/content/5746165a-3a0c-42c7-9a2e-cb7cf5f33f46\", \"https://www.ft.com/content/6319e205-d688-4521-b048-8d69a2c40847\", \"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/blackrock-is-working-on-a-rival-takeover-bid-for-credit-suisse-financial-times-reports.html\"]"}, "resolution": true}

Jean Carroll, a writer and former advice columnist for Elle magazine, has accused former President Donald Trump of raping her in the mid-1990s at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan. Carroll first spoke about the allegations in 2019, during Trump's presidency, and filed a defamation lawsuit against him in November 2019 after he denied the allegations and accused her of lying to boost sales of her forthcoming book. The defamation lawsuit stalled in the courts for years and has yet to reach trial.\nIn 2022, New York lawmakers passed the state's Adult Survivors Act, which provided sexual abuse victims a one-year window to sue attackers for assaults that occurred years earlier. This law enabled Carroll to file a second lawsuit against Trump in November 2022, accusing him of both rape and defamation for denying the assault took place. The second lawsuit, seeking damages and a retraction of his denial, is now being presented in a New York City federal courtroom under the supervision of US District Judge Lewis Kaplan. The proceedings began on April 25, 2023, and both sides rested their cases on May 4th.\nFor Trump, a loss in the defamation case could lead to financial damages and further damage his reputation. Moreover, an unfavorable outcome in the rape case could potentially validate Carroll's allegations and add to the controversies surrounding Trump's personal conduct. Losing the cases could also have broader implications, as it could embolden other accusers to pursue legal action and weaken Trump's political influence moving forward.", "resolution_date": "2023-05-09", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "metaculus", "url": "https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/16741/", "metadata": {"is_resolved": true, "date_begin": "2023-05-05", "date_close": "2023-05-12", "gpt_3p5_category": "Politics & Governance", "resolution_criteria": "The question will resolve as Yes if the jury in the lawsuit between E.

On February 28, an anonymous US official told Reuters, \"I don't believe we've seen anything specific as a result of the direction that he gave, at least not yet, in terms of appreciable or noticeable muscle movements\". On March 1, NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told the AP, \"We will always do what is needed to protect and defend our allies, but we don\u2019t think there is any need now to change the alert levels of NATO\u2019s nuclear forces.\"\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine relinquished possession of the nuclear weapons it inherited upon signing the Budapest Memorandum in 1994. The Memorandum establishes security assurances from the US, Russia, and the UK for Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, in return for those states to relinquish their nuclear weapons, which they did between 1993 to 1996. Following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainians have criticized the Budapest Memorandum. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on February 22, 2022:\nI am initiating consultations within the framework of the Budapest Memorandum. It was entrusted to the Minister of Foreign Affairs to convene them. If they do not take place again or if there are no security guarantees for our country as a result of them, Ukraine will have every right to believe that the Budapest Memorandum does not work, and all package decisions of 1994 will be called into question\nOn September 21, 2022, Putin delivered a speech in which he announced the partial mobilization of reservists and also issued what media sources have characterized as a threatened willingness to use nuclear weapons, saying\nWhen the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people.

For the purposes of this question, Ukrainian territory will be defined as internationally recognized prior to 2014 (that is, including Crimea, the Donetsk Republic, and the Luhansk Republic), including its 12 nautical mile territorial sea.

Nevertheless, sometimes ships and airplanes of rival countries find themselves in very close proximity in the course of proving some point or other. The United States Navy, which frequently transits through disputed zones to contest \"excessive\" territorial claims, is particularly often on the wrong end of what it calls \"unsafe and unprofessional incidents\".\nOccasionally, such incidents escalate from close intercepts and tense standoffs to outright physical collisions. In 1988 a Soviet military vessel intentionally rammed the cruiser Yorktown in the Black Sea in what has been called the last incident of the Cold War. There were several low-speed collisions between stalking submarines of Russia and the United States in the 1990s. Most notoriously, in 2001 a hot-dogging Chinese fighter pilot accidentally collided with a US Navy surveillance aircraft he was intercepting, leading to an emergency landing and a hostage-like standoff.\nThe invasion of Ukraine has started a new and more dangerous era in Russian-Western relations, marked by a return to Cold War levels of rhetoric and signaling. Indeed, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the situation may be more dangerous than during the height of the Cold War, for the lack of agreed-upon rules and restraints. Both sides are intensifying naval activity in the Baltic, while the frequency of tense incidents around Polish airspace is said to be increasing.

He was first elected in a special election in 2020 to fill the remaining two years of a retiring Senator's term. Because his election was close, was crucial to deciding overall partisan control in the Senate, and required a second-round runoff election to determine an overall winner, it was watched unusually carefully on a national level. Warnock was praised for his skillful and calculating campaigning; at one point, he borrowed a friend's puppy for a campaign ad about how lovable he was, because his own dog was apparently considered too big and scary for white voters.\nHerschel Walker is a football star from Georgia who has lived for many years in Texas. Although previously unknown politically, he secured the 2022 Republican Senate nomination easily once endorsed by Donald Trump. But professional and \"establishment\" politicos fretted. As the campaign proceeded and Walker's personal and professional limitations became clear, he came to be seen increasingly as an exemplar of a class of ill-advisable Senate candidates parachuted by Trump into otherwise favorable races. \"Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome\", Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell noted portentously.\nThough changing demographically, Georgia is still a Republican state, rated R+3 by the Cook Partisan Voting Index. And the President's party usually loses Senate seats in midterm elections rather than gaining them, although this pattern is not so well-established as in the House. But Warnock is considered a first-rate talent and Walker not necessarily so. The broader 2022 outcome was much more favorable to Democrats than base rates might have predicted, and the most uniquely energizing issue for Democrats this cycle \u2013 abortion \u2013 may be one on which Walker is especially vulnerable.\nThe 2022 regular Senate election in Georgia, whose victor will win a six-year Senate term this time, has again come down to a run-off, to be held on Tuesday December 6. Democrats have already eliminated the possibility of Republican Senate control, but even one additional seat could still make a big difference, and the next election is anyway only two years away. Commentary has tended to favor Warnock, but everyone admits either side could easily win.\nWill Raphael Warnock defeat Herschel Walker in the 2022 Georgia Senate runoff on Tuesday?\nThis question resolves Yes if and when the Associated Press call the 2022 Georgia Senate runoff election for Warnock, and No if and when they call it for Walker.

Lyndon Johnson was the President of the United States, The Beatles were finishing the White Album, and the United States Navy was trying to figure out why it was losing so many world-class fighter planes to a third-tier enemy in a place called Vietnam.\nTraditionally, Navy fighters had destroyed roughly ten or more enemy aircraft for everyone one they lost in return, for a loss-exchange-ratio \u2013 what everyone really wanted to call a kill ratio \u2013 of some 10:1. In its grimmest and most glorious battles such as the Navy preferred to remember, this statistic might dive to around 2 or 3 to 1; in dominating unequal battles such as the Navy actually preferred to fight it might climb even much higher still.\nBut in Vietnam, while the material factors all seemed to point towards the dominant, high ratio, the operations research told the admirals the truth \u2013 that Vietnam's tiny, rookie air force of mostly hopelessly obsolete Soviet cast-offs like the MiG-17 and -19 was handling the first team very roughly, holding it to a kill ratio no better and perhaps somewhat worse than 2:1. Worse, new new MiG-21 was coming into Vietnamese service, with its high speed and air-to-air guided missiles. The problem only seemed to be getting worse. But what even was the problem?\nWhen Navy Captain Frank Ault was tasked, in response to the shocking failures, with examining the Navy's process for acquiring and employing air-to-air missile systems, he chose to interpret his mandate broadly. Previous reviews had been too piecemeal, he suggested. None \"addressed concurrently the aircraft-missile fire control system across the complete spectrum\".\nAult ultimately concluded that the problem was human and cultural. The Navy had gone all-in its new F-4 Phantom heavy interceptor-fighter and the high-tech, quantitative approach it embodied. Wars were to be fought by pushbutton and the enemy pre-emptively denied a vote, killed by missiles from beyond visual range before he had any opportunity to act. Chance and judgement were to be distrusted and eliminated. But this approach had broken down over Vietnam, where combat conditions had not corresponded to those envisioned by Pentagon planners. Enemies might be detected at long range, but in crowded multi-service and multi-national airspace, this gave no license to attack without first making a visual identification. Denied the ability to fight their preferred fight, F-4 pilots were being forced into close-range dogfights for which their aircraft and training were not designed. Even when ideal conditions did allow them to play to their airplanes' presumed strengths, returns were generally a pathetic fraction of what the numerical simulations had predicted. Results had been postulated based on calculations that were meaningless because they neglected the cumulative effects of stress, fear, and accumulated small human difficulties; what Claueswitz called friction.\nAult's answer was to set up a Fighter Weapons School at Miramar, California that would become known as TOPGUN, to teach the skills that had been lost. \"We threw away the tactics manual and wrote our own,\" recalled the school's first commander. Equipment and budget were virtually nil, but personnel were exceptional. Training assignments were just four weeks long, but intense, realistic, and rewarding. Assignees, selected from among the most promising relatively new pilots, were expected to \"spread the gospel\" on their return to the fleet. It worked. When the halftime bell sounded, the Paris Peace Talks collapsed, and President Nixon ordered a resumption of large-scale aerial warfare over North Vietnam, the Navy was ready. Navy kill ratios climbed back into the 10:1 regime and stayed there for the rest of the war, while the Air Force, which then had not yet implemented its own equivalent of Top Gun, continued to struggle.\nYears passed, Vietnam became for Americans only a painful memory, and TOPGUN continued. It was 1983, some thirteen years after the first, 01-69 class graduated; Ronald Reagan was president, U2 had just released the War album, and magazine writer Ehud Yonay painted an indelible portrait of how the school looked in the early 1980s for California magazine. \"In those days,\" his own subjects would later observe,\nbefore high definition video and Go-Pro type cameras, the written word combined with still photography was the only practical and affordable way to convey to others what flying fighters was like. Ehud\u2019s story was among the very few articles that transported the average reader in [...] it\u2019s no surprise someone later recognized potential movie material\n\"Someone\" was Hollywood producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, who turned the Top Gun academy and the portrait of \"Fightertown, U.S.A.\" in the 1980s into an epochal Hollywood triumph, \"the most aesthetically arresting propaganda film ever created.\" The stories that Navy recruiters opened up for business directly inside movie theater lobbies, or that Navy recruitment increased 300%, or 500% or 1,000% are difficult to confirm, but the sheer proportion of post-Cold War veterans today who trace their involvement with the Navy to Top Gun is difficult to gainsay. Indeed, the recruitment boom was so indiscriminate that not a few Air Force veterans today sheepishly admit they were drawn in without realizing that Tom Cruise had actually been flying for the rival service.\n(Not everyone was convinced; Roger Ebert was awed by director Tony Scott's ability to depict complex aerial battle maneuvers without overly disorienting the viewer, but added, \"Look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another.\" And the film's absurd horniness was so excessive that it was apparently blamed for the Tailhook Convention sexual harassment scandal.)\nYears passed. It was 2022. Joe Biden was President, Taylor Swift had just released the \"Midnights\" album, and Tom Cruise somehow was still easily justifying his place as a first-tier movie star. It was time to release the remake. No-one expected much from what was seen as essentially a period tribute piece. But Maverick's success went on to astonish the world. Somehow, the younger work had been matured, aged gracefully. Its simplistic good-vs-evil and boy-meets-girl premises had a new attraction in an age of recondite \"expanded universes.\" Tomris Laffly, writing for the website of the late Roger Ebert, praised Maverick for marrying the old Top Gun action ethos with an unexpectedly high tone. \"In some sense, what this movie takes most seriously are concepts like friendship, loyalty, romance, and okay, bromance.\" Audiences agreed; Maverick was not only the hit of the year, but one of the highest-grossing movies of all time.\nWill Top Gun: Maverick win Favorite Movie at the 2022 People's Choice Awards?\nThis question resolves Yes if Maverick wins and No if it doesn't.

(March 1, 2023)", "body": "Related Question on Metaculus:\nWill Russia order a general mobilization by January 1, 2023? (resolved Ambiguous)\nAccording to Wikipedia:\nOn 21 September 2022, seven months into the invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"partial mobilization\" of military reservists in Russia. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russia had a \"huge mobilization reserve\" and planned to mobilize 300,000 in reserve. The precise details of the mobilization plans are currently unclear, however, as the exact number of people to be mobilized is classified. On October 28, Shoigu told Putin that mobilization had been completed. It has been speculated that officially, mobilization will only end after Putin signs the relevant decree, but Putin himself has questioned this point of view.\nThe most striking consequence of this news was the exodus of Russians abroad:\nRussian citizens reportedly purchased plane tickets to other countries following the mobilization. Russia's Federal Security Service stated that 261,000 Russians had already left Russia as of 26 September. On 6 October, the Kremlin denied reports that 700,000 Russians have fled the country since Putin announced the mobilisation order. Many kilometers of traffic jams formed at Russia's borders with Kazakhstan, Georgia, Belarus, Finland and Mongolia. More than 200,000 Russian men fled to Kazakhstan. In the first week after the announcement, Georgia took in the most refugees.\nMultiple sources claim that the next wave of mobilization is about to start in December 2022 or January 2023. However, the Kremlin denies that a second wave of mobilization is being considered.\nIn its September 21, 2022, Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on the \"partial mobilization\" saying\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s announcement of \u201cpartial mobilization\u201d on September 21 reflected many problems Russia faces in its faltering invasion of Ukraine that Moscow is unlikely to be able to resolve in the coming months. Putin\u2019s order to mobilize part of Russia\u2019s \u201ctrained\u201d reserve, that is, individuals who have completed their mandatory conscript service, will not generate significant usable Russian combat power for months.\nElsewhere in the same report, referring to Russia's ongoing and largely unacknowledged mobilization efforts and its volunteer efforts, ISW stated\nRussian federal subjects (regions) are continuing crypto-mobilization efforts regardless of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s declaration of partial mobilization on September 21. Novosibirsk Oblast Governor Andrey Travnikov announced that the oblast will form one or two more volunteer battalions if necessary for the Russian special military operation in Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff added that the \u201dself-mobilization\u201d campaign is ongoing simultaneously with partial mobilization, noting that Cossacks are recruiting candidates to serve in Rosgvardia.", "resolution_date": "2023-03-01", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "metaculus", "url": "https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/14323/", "metadata": {"is_resolved": true, "date_begin": "2022-12-28", "date_close": "2023-03-01", "gpt_3p5_category": "Security & Defense", "resolution_criteria": "The subquestions below will resolve as Yes if, before the listed date, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) announces that another wave of mobilization is underway in Russia.

Be sure to take note of the altered resolution criteria.\nSome 10\u00bd months ago, on February 24th, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. Their concept of operations apparently involved rapidly taking the capital, deposing the government, and largely completing the country's conquest before Western countries could co-ordinate on a reaction. By April, after fierce Ukrainian resistance and serious deficiencies in Russian military preparedness defeated this plan, Russia shifted focus to the Donets Basion (Donbas) region in the country's east, where conditions were more favorable. This offensive also bogged down quickly, and Russia's offensive ambitions continually narrowed into the summer until they were focused ultimately around the town of Bakhmut, where operations were being conducted largely by the \"Wagner Group\" private army under Yevgeny Prigozhin instead of by the regular Russian army.\nBy fall, Bakhmut was described as an obsession for Russia and a \"meat grinder\" into which its best forces were being wastefully thrown. Nonetheless, the Bakhmut offensive continued, with some analysts speculating that it was essentially a propaganda operation designed to provide Russian President Putin with a \"victory\" to offset mounting defeats, or even motivated by Prigozhin's personal financial interests.\nOn December 20th, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bakhmut to show support for the defenders. On January 6th, Russia launched a powerful assault on the adjacent town of Soledar, where Ukrainian officials acknowledged the situation was \"difficult.\" As of January 10th, there were competing claims about whether Soledar had fallen or would fall, and whether this portended a larger Ukrainian defeat over the coming days.", "resolution_date": "2023-01-27", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "metaculus", "url": "https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/14607/", "metadata": {"is_resolved": true, "date_begin": "2023-01-18", "date_close": "2023-01-26", "gpt_3p5_category": "Security & Defense", "resolution_criteria": "Central Bakhmut is defined as the area inside the orange dashed line on this map:\nThe sole authoritative source for defining areas of Russian control will be the areas of \"assessed Russian advances\" published in the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) Ukraine Interactive War Map.
