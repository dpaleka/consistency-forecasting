Companies are replaced when they no longer meet the index's listing criteria with those that do. Over time, the index became a bellwether of the U.S. economy, reflecting economic changes. For example, U.S. Steel was removed from the index in 1991 and replaced by building material company Martin Marietta.\nDJIA milestones are a popular subject of reports, particularly in increments of $5,000.

The last in the series of pioneering Soviet robotic lunar missions was Luna-24, which sent about 170 grams of moon material back to Earth in 1976.\nLuna-25 will launch atop a Soyuz-2.1b rocket, which in recent years has been very reliable.\nThe mission is currently set to launch from Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Russian Far East on August 11, 2023, which is 47 years after Luna-24.\nThe mission launch was delayed multiple times in the past (see the table below which is translated by Google Translate from the Wikipedia article about Luna-25 in Russian). Last time this happened at the end of May when the launch was moved from July to August.\nSource: Wikipedia, translation from Russian by Google Translate\nBecause of the delays in the past this question asks if they will launch the mission in the current launch window, which is July to August, however, the launch on September 1st local time for Vostochny Cosmodrome will still resolve the question as \"Yes\", if Luna-25 will reach Earth's orbit.\nFrom the recent video interview with Yuri Borisov, General Director of Roscosmos from 16th of June (automated translation based on automated transcription):\nWell, to begin with, the interest in the Moon arose after the possibility of water extraction was identified. If there is water, it means there is life and we can organize, including on the planets, a new station and think about industrial use of lunar resources. This is why interest in the Moon has been aroused recently, not only in our country, but in a number of other countries as well. We are actually, after a long break, 46 years to be exact, going back to the Lunar Program, Luna 25, which is our project to put a landing on the Moon. An automatic station at the South Pole. Taking soil and conducting a number of scientific experiments. Preparations for the launch are proceeding as planned. We actually had to postpone the launch from July 11 and move it to August. We cannot postpone it any further, unfortunately. The launch windows are the way the ballistics of reaching the Moon is set up. You know, this is a very responsible procedure, a soft landing. And so, of course, the experiment is quite expensive, you had to verify everything. You have probably heard that last year we refused because the personal characteristics of the laser number did not suit us and could lead to negative consequences. This experiment we postponed it. Now all the major technical difficulties have been overcome. According to the latest information, all the mathematical modelling, and we are doing almost a simulation, all the landings are going according to plan, preparations are underway to deliver the satellite to the launch site. And we hope that the launch will take place in August.\nMore recently, on June 30th, Russian media quoted Borisov reporting the mission's chances of success to Putin (automatic translation from Russian with Google Translate):\nBorisov said that the success of missions similar to Luna-25 is 70%\nAccording to the head of Roscosmos, landing simulations are being intensively carried out at the moment in order to eliminate all the nuances\nMOSCOW, 30 June. /TASS/.

Its four main parts are:\nOrbiter, which orbits the moon and sends data.\nImpactor, which crashes onto the moon\u2019s surface. It sends data before crashing. After the crash, Orbiter analyzes the debris and collects the data.\nLander - a vehicle that lands on the moon's surface such that the instruments inside it are safe.\nRover - a vehicle that moves around the surface of the moon and sends data back.\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on October 22, 2008. It had an orbiter and an impactor. The mission fulfilled all its objectives and even found water. Chandrayaan-2 was initially meant to be launched in 2013. It was planned as an Indian-made orbiter and a Russian-made lander. As the Indian Express explains:\nThe kind of lander and rover that Russia was preparing to send on Chandrayaan-2, however, developed problem on a different mission, forcing Roscosmos to make design corrections. But the new proposed design was found to be incompatible to Chandrayaan-2. Russia had to eventually pull itself out from the collaboration, which left ISRO to make efforts to develop its own lander and rover through research and development. This task took a few years to accomplish.\nThe launch finally happened six years later, on 22nd July, 2019. While Chandrayaan-2 successfully managed to orbit the moon, the lander lost contact just before touchdown and crashed on its surface. Chandrayaan-3 picks up where Chandrayaan-2 left off. It only has a lander and a rover.\nOn Friday, July 14 Chandrayaan-3 began with a successful launch.\nThe Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) said Friday afternoon that the Chandrayaan-3 mission had launched successfully and the rocket had entered \u201cprecise orbit.\u201d The vessel is now scheduled to travel for more than a month in orbit and then land at the moon\u2019s south pole on Aug. 23.\nIf the Chandrayaan\u2019s four-legged craft sticks its landing, it will deploy a 60-pound, solar-powered rover to scour the lunar surface for two weeks. It would also catapult India into a small group of countries, consisting of the United States, Russia and China, that have managed the feat.", "resolution_date": "2023-08-24", "question_type":

The most recent and on-going conflict is the Russo-Ukrainian war.\nFrom the onset of the war, most of the conflict has taken place on land, however the Black Sea has also seen significant naval conflict.\nThe region is host to the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet (BSF) which boasts a fleet of around 40 vessels ranging from large frigates (up to 5,400 tonne), smaller corvettes (up to 2,200 tonne), as well as submarines.\nNote: See here for Wikipedia's list of active Russian Navy vessels (sort for Black Sea Fleet)\nThe Ukrainian Navy on the other hand has a minuscule fleet, consisting mainly of auxiliary vessels and fast-attack crafts. All of Ukraine's larger vessels were lost as a result of the war; her final large surface vessel, the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, was scuttled by Ukrainian forces to prevent her capture.\nNote: See here for Wikipedia's list of active Ukrainian Navy vessels\nWhilst a large proportion of Ukrainian Navy vessels have been lost, the Russian Navy has lost a large number of vessels. In the BSF\u2019s attempt to establish and maintain naval supremacy in the Black Sea, a number of smaller and larger vessels have been lost, perhaps most notably the fleet's ex-flagship vessel, the cruiser Moskva (Moscow) on 14 April 2022 as a result of Ukrainian land-based anti-ship missile strikes.\nThe Turkish Navy is another navy who operate in the Black Sea. Turkey has huge strategic influence over the region as they have a degree of control over the Bosporus Strait as a result of the Montreux Convention.\nThe US Navy has also frequently transited the Bosporus Strait and entered the region. In the Cold War, a ramming incident occurred between US and Soviet navies. More recent confrontation came about when a Russian Su-27 downed a US MQ-9 Reaper UAV over the Black Sea in March 2023.\nGiven the importance of the Black Sea, as well as the substantial amount of on-going military conflict, it is entirely possible that one or more navy vessel(s) operating in the area may be lost.\nN.B.

Congress should require that the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (who is responsible for managing PEPFAR) provide an explanation for the political discrimination in hiring by these agencies and organizations and a plan to redress the imbalance.\nAll of this has created concern that PEPFAR may either fail to be extended, or may be extended, but only for a shorter term than the previous five years.", "resolution_date": "2023-10-02", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "metaculus", "url": "https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/18180/", "metadata": {"is_resolved": true, "date_begin": "2023-08-01", "date_close": "2023-09-30", "gpt_3p5_category": "Politics & Governance", "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves based upon whether PEPFAR is extended by an act of Congress which is then signed into law by the President of the United States before September 30th, 2023.

Additionally Russia temporarily halted its grain exports, further exacerbating the situation. This resulted in a rise in world food prices and the threat of famine in lower-income countries, and accusation that Russia weaponizing food supplies. To address the issue, discussions began in April, hosted by Turkey (which controls the maritime routes from the Black Sea) and supported by the UN. The resulting agreement was signed in Istanbul on 22 July 2022, valid for a period of 120 days. The July agreement created procedures to safely export grain from certain ports to attempt to address the 2022 food crisis. A joint coordination and inspection center was set up in Turkey, with the UN serving as secretariat.\n. . .\nThe original agreement was set to expire on 19 November 2022. Russia suspended its participation in the agreement for several days due to a drone attack on Russian naval ships elsewhere in the Black Sea, but rejoined following mediation. On 17 November 2022, the UN and Ukraine announced that the agreement had been extended for a further 120 days. In March 2023, Turkey and the UN announced that they secured a second extension for at least another 60 days. In May 2023, the deal was once again extended for 60 days, expiring on 18 July.\nThe grain deal expired in July after Russia withdrew. In early September, T\u00fcrkiye (formerly Turkey) has been in talks with Russia to revive the deal, though as of September 7, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far held firm to demands such as only returning to the deal when western nations lift restrictions on banking and logistics.", "resolution_date": "2023-10-01", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "metaculus", "url": "https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/18690/", "metadata": {"is_resolved": true, "date_begin": "2023-09-07", "date_close": "2023-09-30", "gpt_3p5_category": "Politics & Governance", "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as Yes if, before October 1, 2023, credible sources report that the Black Sea Grain Initiative has been reinstated.

The original mission was known as the United Nations Organization Mission in Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) until 2010 when it was replaced by MONUSCO. According to the UN:\nThe new mission has been authorized to use all necessary means to carry out its mandate relating, among other things, to the protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel and human rights defenders under imminent threat of physical violence and to support the Government of the DRC in its stabilization and peace consolidation efforts.\nMONUSCO has been planning for a withdrawal from the DRC, however in September of 2023 DRC President Felix-Antoine Tshisekedi insisted that the start of MONUSCO's \"accelerated retreat\" should begin a year sooner, at the end of December 2023. Following Tshisekedi's statement, the UN Security Council \"expressed its readiness to decide, by the end of this year and as a matter of priority, the future of MONUSCO and its gradual, responsible and sustainable withdrawal, as well as realistic and concrete steps to be taken in that regard.\"\nThe UN had extended the MONUSCO mandate for one year on December 20, 2022, authorizing a troop ceiling as follows:\n. . . MONUSCO\u2019s authorised troop ceiling will comprise 13,500 military personnel, 660 military observers and staff officers, 591 police personnel, and 1,410 personnel of formed police units, and invites the Secretariat to consider further reduction of MONUSCO\u2019s level of military deployment, in line with the joint strategy on the progressive and phased drawdown of MONUSCO (S/2020/1041).\nAn August 2023 Report of the Secretary-General](https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-repub\u2026) described options for the future of the mission and included the following paragraph:\nAs a first step towards the Mission\u2019s full withdrawal, the force would consolidate its presence in the 13 high-risk territories of Ituri, as well as North and South Kivu. This would be accompanied by a rationalization of permanent and temporary bases that would allow the force to reduce its reliance on framework battalions in favour of units that are more fit for purpose in the current context. All units from South Kivu (southern sector) would subsequently be repatriated together with one static framework battalion from North Kivu (central sector) and some specialist units, military observers and staff officers, resulting in a reduction of its current deployed strength from 12,500 to approximately 10,500 military personnel. As the Mission\u2019s focus shifts to North Kivu and Ituri, it would nonetheless retain projection capacity for South Kivu.

It is the 3rd-highest role in American government, behind the President and the Vice President in the presidential line of succession.\nThe Speaker is chosen by a simple majority of House members who are voting.\nThe magic number is 218 \u2013 kind of.\nA candidate requires votes from a majority of lawmakers who are voting to be elected speaker. That means if all 435 members are present and voting, the number of votes needed is 218.\nBut lawmakers can decide to skip the vote, or vote \"present,\" which reduces the vote threshold needed to win the speakership. Speakers Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and John Boehner, R-Ohio, both won the speakership without reaching 218 votes.\nThe Republican Party holds the majority in the 118th Congress. On January 6, 2023, Kevin McCarthy was elected speaker of the House after 15 ballots. In order to win support of the fractured Republican caucus, McCarthy offered several concessions, including provisions making it easier to oust the speaker.\nOn September 30th, facing a looming government shutdown, McCarthy \"abandoned party hardliners' insistence that any bill pass the House with only Republican votes\" and passed a stopgap funding bill with \"overwhelming Democratic support.\" The bill averted a shutdown for 45 days, but angered the right wing of the Republican party.\nMcCarthy dismissed concerns that hardline Republicans could try to oust him as leader.\n\"I want to be the adult in the room, go ahead and try,\" McCarthy told reporters. \"And you know what? If I have to risk my job for standing up for the American public, I will do that.\"\nOn October 2nd, Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, \"the Donald Trump ally and conservative bomb-thrower who has been a nagging thorn in leadership\u2019s side, filed a resolution...to force a vote to overthrow his political nemesis, Kevin McCarthy, as speaker of the House.\"\nGaetz's resolution was successful, with Democrats voting overwhelmingly to remove McCarthy.

{"id": "57d75243-8bf8-4c", "title": "Will Hamas lose control of Gaza before 2024?", "body": "Gaza, also known as the Gaza Strip is a small, densely populated coastal territory located on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It borders Israel to the north and east, Egypt to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. Covering an area of about 365 square kilometers (141 square miles), the Gaza Strip is home to more than two million Palestinians.\nIn the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip, and it remained under Egyptian control until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Israel captured it. In 1994, as a result of the Oslo Accords the Palestinian Authority was established and took over the administration of the Gaza Strip, along with parts of the West Bank.\nIn 2007, following internal Palestinian conflict, Hamas, an Islamist political and militant group, took de facto control of the Gaza Strip. Hamas's rise to power in Gaza was marked by its victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, a result that surprised many and led to tensions with political rival Fatah, culminating in the 2007 clashes. Since then, the Gaza Strip has been under the administrative and military control of Hamas, while the West Bank remains under the Palestinian Authority.\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel.\nAccording to Foreign Policy:\nInitial information suggests that the attack has no precedent in recent Israeli history. The IDF said approximately 2,200 rockets were launched in the initial barrages, making it the largest rocket attack against Israel since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. The number of rockets launched was an order of magnitude larger than the attacks at the beginning of the 2014 and 2021 crises. Hamas also appears to have been quite innovative, using paragliders among other means to enter Israel by surprise. The infiltration is particularly devastating for Israel due to the lives lost and the hostages taken.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, \u201cWe are at war,\u201d and launched Operation Iron Swords, conducting airstrikes in Gaza and calling up reservists.

Set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, this rate serves as a benchmark for various other interest rates in the economy, including those for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards. The FOMC adjusts the rate to influence monetary conditions, aiming to achieve policy objectives such as full employment and stable prices. By raising or lowering the fed funds rate, the Federal Reserve can either cool down an overheated economy or stimulate economic activity, thereby indirectly influencing inflation, employment, and overall economic growth.\nSince July 26, 2023, the Federal Funds Rate has been at 5.25% to 5.50%. In late August, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave a speech at Jackson Hole, where he emphasized the Fed's commitment to bringing inflation down to its 2% target. Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has significantly tightened its monetary policy to combat persistently high inflation.

{"id": "c9e00d3c-fdd4-4a", "title": "Will Delhi perform cloud seeding before December 1, 2023?", "body": "New Delhi, the capital of India, has been experiencing very poor air quality. According to data from AirNow, the majority of the month of November has been at an air quality index (AQI) level of \"Very Unhealthy\" or worse, and nearly half of the month has been at levels of \"Hazardous\".\nAccording to a November 10th Nature article:\nAs the Hindu festival of Diwali kicks off on 10 November, the Indian capital of Delhi, already blanketed in choking smog, is bracing for pollution to worsen. Over the past week, children struggling to breath the acrid air have flooded hospital emergency departments, and schools have been forced to close. . .\n\u201cEvery year it is a similar story,\u201d says Vinayak Sinha, an atmospheric chemist at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali.\nBut although Delhi\u2019s air is attracting attention now, scientists say that the spike is actually typical for this time of year. The post-monsoon season, which lasts from October to December, delivers an annual pollution bomb to Delhi, a megacity of more than 30 million people. Other cities in India are also plagued by poor air quality at this time of year.\nSinha says that atmospheric conditions after the monsoon exacerbate pollution. Rainfall that washes pollutants out of the air during the monsoon ceases. As temperatures fall, the upper boundary of the troposphere \u2014 the lowest layer of atmosphere \u2014 drops in altitude and the troposphere shrinks. That causes the soup of pollutants in the troposphere to become more concentrated, says Sinha. \u201cYou have a smaller container now into which your air emissions are being stored,\u201d he says.\nEven so, current conditions came as something of a surprise, says Karthik Ganesan, a policy researcher at the Council on Energy Environment and Water in New Delhi. That\u2019s because the amount of crop waste burnt in the neighbouring Punjab region was lower than usual this year, causing some people to expect a milder increase in pollution.\nBut as it turned out, air quality was as poor as ever because of changing meteorological conditions, including drops in wind speed on certain days. When wind speed falls, the air stagnates, trapping local emissions and leading to a pollution spike, says Ganesan.\nNew Delhi is reportedly considering new approaches to improve the air quality, such as cloud seeding. According to Wired:\nIndia\u2019s capital, New Delhi, is preparing a new weapon in the fight against deadly air pollution: cloud seeding. The experiment, which could take place as early as next week, would introduce chemicals like silver iodide into a cloudy sky to create rain and, it\u2019s hoped, wash away the fine particulate matter hovering over one of the world\u2019s largest cities.\nThe need is desperate. Delhi has already tried traffic restriction measures, multimillion-dollar air filtration towers, and the use of fleets of water-spraying trucks to dissolve the particulate matter in the air\u2014but to no avail.\n. . .\nNow, Delhi officials are seeking permission from federal agencies in India to try cloud seeding. The technique involves flying an aircraft to spray clouds with salts like silver or potassium iodide or solid carbon dioxide, also known as dry ice, to induce precipitation. The chemical molecules attach to moisture already in the clouds to form bigger droplets that then fall as rain. China has used artificial rain to tackle air pollution in the past\u2014but for cloud seeding to work properly, you need significant cloud cover with reasonable moisture content, which Delhi generally lacks during the winter. If weather conditions are favorable, scientists leading the project at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur plan to carry out cloud seeding around November 20.", "resolution_date": "2023-12-01", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "metaculus", "url": "https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/19919/", "metadata": {"is_resolved": true, "date_begin": "2023-11-14", "date_close": "2023-11-30", "gpt_3p5_category": "Environment & Energy", "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as Yes if, after November 14, 2023, and before December 1, 2023, credible sources report that Delhi has performed cloud seeding.\nFine Print\nThe cloud seeding need not successfully produce rain or cut down on the smog.

This market does not concern existing viruses such as RSV, because that is hardly mysterious.\n\nI understand that the \"mysterious\" pathogen may be a mutation of an existing pathogen (like covid was). This obviously counts, if there has been a substantial mutation (like covid was). Minor mutations (like the constant minor changes to the seasonal flu) dont count. For example, let's assume that the \"mystery pneumonia\" is an RSV outbreak. That would not count, unless it turns out to be a novel Super-RSV with substantially higher mortality/infectiousness/whatever,\n\nAlso, this question pertains to the specific mystery pneumonia observed in China, wherever it may be from. Only this one counts. If this pathogen is originally from a different country and spreads from there, it counts because its still the pathogen that this question is about. If it turns out that there is a second mystery pneumonia that has nothing to do with the current outbreak in China but still spreads globally, it does not count (because this question is about the present outbreak in China).\n", "resolution_date": "2023-12-31", "question_type": "binary", "data_source": "manifold", "url": "https://manifold.markets/ThomasTwenhoven/will-the-current-mystery-pneumonia", "metadata": {"is_resolved": true, "date_begin": "2023-11-22", "date_close": "2023-12-31", "gpt_3p5_category": "Healthcare & Biology", "resolution_criteria": "Not applicable/available for this question.", "extracted_urls": "[]"}, "resolution": false}

If we end up in a world where LK-99 convincingly displays a Meissner effect, but doesn\u2019t show the expected resistivity behavior, I will solicit opinions from subject matter experts.

So one line of reasoning queried whether the 1.8 million figure was a well sandbagged number or whether demand causing production to be throttled back?\n\nAbove may have failed to account for other explanations: Q2 Earning call suggested there would be production shutdowns but it isn't clear to what extent these were for upgrading production speed compared to other things like retool for Highland upgrade.
